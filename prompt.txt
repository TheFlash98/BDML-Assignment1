Text: Droughts are amongst the most damaging natural hazard with cascading impacts across multiple economic sectors, the environment, and society. For instance, droughts can lead to agriculture production losses, intense wildfires, waterways disruptions, water supply shortages, and many others.

Improved drought forecasts followed by proper strategic planning can help to deal with these severe impacts of drought. However, despite several decades of progress, accurate forecasting of drought is still a challenge that is further compounded by climate change. Drought indices are commonly used to monitor and quantify droughts. Several drought indices have been proposed with different degrees of complexity, data requirements, physical processes, and purpose. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) [1] and Standardized Precipitation Evapo-Transpiration (SPEI) [2] are two powerful and commonly used drought indices. For the purpose of this study, we focus on the SPEI as it takes the atmospheric water balance into account and is a more suited drought indicator in the context of climate change.

Several approaches based on stochastic, probabilistic, and machine learning techniques have been proposed in the literature to forecast the SPEI and other indices at multiple time scales. The models like Artificial Neural Network(ANN) [3], Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [4], Convolutional LSTM [5], Wavelet ANN [6], integrated ANN [7] have been demonstrated. In [7], a hybrid neural network is proposed that combines multiple models trained using different losses to improve the accuracy of drought forecasting. However, this approach does not explicitly capture the temporal dimension while predicting extreme drought conditions. Despite significant progress, a key challenge

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.in forecasting drought indices, including SPEI, remains. The existing work on drought forecasting does not emphasize both evaluation and analysis of the extreme and severe drought as well as wet events. Specifically, current approaches do not adequately address the imbalance in time-series forecasting aspects. The imbalance is due to the fact that the extremely dry and wet events are few as compared to normal events and therefore are difficult to forecast.

In this paper, we attempt to address the above-mentioned challenge by developing a novel loss function (SQUASH) that is differentiable, captures the shape error of the time-series aspect of the problem, handles imbalanced data, and is computationally efficient. We validate our approach for multi-step forecasting of SPEI drought index over two regions in the USA and India. A detailed ablation study with different surrogate loss functions is present in this article.
