Abstract
This research proposes a hybrid model for predicting ship speed through water, ad- 1
dressing challenges in estimating GHG emissions from shipping while contributing 2
to climate change mitigation. Predicting ship speed through water is a key element 3
in calculating GHG emissions. However, few models address this prediction in a 4
way that integrates both physical principles and machine learning. Our approach 5
combines physical modeling with data-driven techniques to predict real ship speed 6
through water in two key steps: "Solve" and "Predict". In the first step “Solve”, a 7
differential equation is resolved to estimate speed through calm water. "Predict" 8
step uses a machine learning model that incorporates maritime and meteorological 9
conditions and historical data to improve speed predictions in real-world conditions. 10
This hybrid approach leverages both physics-based knowledge and machine learn- 11
ing models to provide a more comprehensive solution for accurately predicting 12
ship speed through water. 13
1 Introduction 14
With the growing focus on greenhouse gas emissions [ 3,4] the maritime transport segment needs 15
to reduce its total annual greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to 2008 . In this context, 16
through-water speed predictions are becoming increasingly relevant for validating ship performance 17
under real operational conditions, as well as for optimizing and predicting ship emissions. Ship speed 18
determines fuel consumption, a major source of greenhouse gases. Therefore, to predict the amount 19
of emissions caused by a ship, prediction of ship speed is an essential factor [8]. 20
In our work we are going to predict the reel through water speed Vwrof ships using a hybrid model 21
which is composed of a first physical part where we solve a differential equation in order to have a 22
physical parameter useful for the second part of the model where we predict Vwrusing a data driven 23
model. The physical part of our model is constructed mainly of a Physics Informed Neural Network 24
(PINN) which allows us to solve a differential equation and to generate the speed through calm water 25
Vwwhich will be useful for the prediction of real speed through water . 26
Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.[7] have demonstrated the effectiveness of PINNs for solving differential equations using collocation 27
points as inputs to the network and a loss function that integrates both the differential equation 28
formula and initial conditions. 29
In the literature, various approaches have been utilized to address issues related to speed prediction: 30
Physical models, which rely on established physical formulas, represent the first category. These 31
models, although grounded in scientific principles, have been widely criticized for their inability to 32
account for the specific characteristics of individual ships [5]. 33
Statistical models offer another approach, focusing on the analysis of historical data to predict 34
ship speed. For instance [ 6] compared three statistical models to predict ship speed based on the 35
revolutions per minute of the main engine and prevailing weather conditions. 36
The advent of large-scale data collection from ships and tracking systems has paved the way for 37
data-driven models. These models utilize machine learning techniques to predict ship speed more 38
accurately. [ 9] applied a sequential random forest for short-term speed prediction, leveraging the vast 39
amounts of data available. Similarly, [ 10] developed a machine learning-based regression model that 40
uses ship navigation data and weather forecasts to predict speed under different weather conditions.[ 2] 41
explored deep learning sequence models, including LSTM, BiLSTM, and transformers, finding that 42
the transformer model delivered the best performance, albeit with a high parameter count. 43
In recent years, some hybrid models have been used. These models aim to leverage the interpretability 44
of physical models while enhancing prediction accuracy with machine learning. [ 1] developed 45
a hybrid model that integrates a physical model with an LSTM to predict state variables . In 46
this approach, the LSTM predicts the residuals of the physical model, which itself combines first 47
principles derived from Newton’s second law with a regression component for data-driven learning. 48
Additionally, [ 10] proposed a hybrid framework based on Gaussian Processes to capture the complex 49
relationships between engine power and ship speed. This method integrates machine learning with 50
domain knowledge grounded in physical principles, resulting in a robust model that minimizes the risk 51
of overfitting. Similarly, Lang et al. [ 5] employed a hybrid model that combines a physics-informed 52
neural network, utilizing a differential equation, with an XGBoost model to predict the speed over 53
ground based on weather conditions. 54
2 Our Proposal 55
We adapt the approach proposed by Lang et al.[ 5] to predict the real speed through water, and we 56
generalize it so that it is not limited to a model specific to a single vessel. In this way, we make the 57
method applicable to any ship that has historical data. Our hybrid model is mainly composed of two 58
parts: a differential equation solver and a data-driven model that enables us to predict the reel speed 59
through water Vwr 60
The first part of our model is a differential equation solver, it enables us to solve a differential equation 61
linking the propulsion power P, the draft Tand the speed through calm water Vw, this last variable is 62
a theoretical variable representing the speed we would have had under PandTif the sea was calm. 63
Lang et al.[ 5] have used a general form of the differential equation linking the three parameters 64
mentioned above, which can be written as: 65
a1∂P
∂Vw+a2∂P
∂T+µ(Vw) = 0, V w∈[Vwmin, Vwmax], T∈[Tmin, Tmax] (1)
where a1anda2are coefficients, and µis a nonlinear function of Vw. 66
In the first part of our model, which represents a solver for our differential equation, the aim is to find 67
a solution to this equation, allowing us to link the three variables P,TandVw. This solution then 68
enables us to generate values for the calm-water speed Vw, which will be used in the second part of 69
the model to predict Vwr. 70
2In this part, which serves as a solver for the differential equation, we use a PINN to solve the differ- 71
ential equation based on experimental data and collocation points. PINNs are proving particularly 72
a powerful performance for solving this type of equation. A PINN is a neural network whose loss 73
function integrates a term corresponding to the loss on the initial conditions, as well as a term 74
quantifying the residual of the differential equation. 75
PINN training requires experimental data on P,TandVw. However, a problem arises here: Vw 76
represents the speed through water under calm sea conditions, a theoretical information that is difficult 77
to obtain when sailing at sea. This would require experiments test in towing tanks to recreate calm 78
water conditions, which is costly and often impractical. 79
Our strategy, therefore, is to exploit the historical data available and select the moments corresponding 80
to calm sea conditions. In addition to the ship’s operational data, our database contains maritime and 81
meteorological information on sea (waves,current and wind conditions) at the time of data collection. 82
Based on this meteorological data, we identify the periods in our database that correspond to the calm 83
sea hypothesis, and use this data as experimental data to train our PINN. 84
The coefficients a1,a2andµof the differential equation are optimized to obtain the most appropriate 85
parameters for our data. We compare three methods for optimizing these coefficients in order to 86
choose the best solution to adopt: 87
1. Optimization during PINN training 88
2. Genetic algorithms 89
3. Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) 90
As the form of the differential equation indicates, solving this equation allows us to obtain information 91
about P, but not about Vw. Therefore, we will use our trained PINN to train a neural network capable 92
of predicting Vwbased on TandP. We compare two approaches to building this network: 93
1.First approach : This involves generating the training data for this network from the 94
previously constructed PINN. Data generation from the PINN proceeds as follows: we 95
define a list of collocation points for VwandT, which are then used as inputs in the trained 96
PINN. The PINN generates a list P, corresponding to the solutions of the differential 97
equation for the input data. These solutions are then used to form triplets (Pi, Ti, Vwi), 98
which serve as training data for the neural network designed to predict Vw. 99
The loss function for this neural network is written as : 100
MSE NN=1
NNX
i=1ˆVw(i)−Vw(i)2
2.Second approach : This involves using a neural network which takes the variables P and T 101
as inputs and provides the variable ˆVwas an output. PINN is integrated into this approach 102
via the loss function, which is written as : 103
MSE NN=1
NNX
i=1PINN
ˆVw(i), T(i)
−P(i)2
In this approach, the physical information represented in the differential equation is trans- 104
mitted to the speed via the trained PINN (which acts as a function) integrated into the loss 105
function. This procedure makes it possible to estimate the speed in calm water from the 106
draft T and the propulsion power P. 107
The second part is a data-driven model that enables us to predict the real speed through water Vwr. 108
This part of the model allows us to add the meteorological and current conditions corresponding to 109
the calm water speed Vwestimated previously in order to predict the real speed through water Vwr. 110
In this part of the model, we utilize various machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest 111
Regressor...), compare their accuracy, and determine which one performs best. 112
