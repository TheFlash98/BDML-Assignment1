ABSTRACT
Poor air quality represents a significant threat to human health, especially in urban
areas. To improve forecasts of air pollutant mass concentrations, there is a need for
high-resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) forecasts as proxy. However, cur-
rent General Circulation Model (GCM) forecasts of AOD suffer from limited spa-
tial resolution, making it difficult to accurately represent the substantial variability
exhibited by AOD at the local scale. To address this, a deep residual convolutional
neural network (ResNet) is evaluated for the GCM to local scale downscaling of
low-resolution global AOD retrievals, outperforming a non-trainable interpola-
tion baseline. We explore the bias correction potential of our ResNet using global
reanalysis data, evaluating it against in-situ AOD observations. The improved
resolution from our ResNet can assist in the study of local AOD variations.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Aerosols, small atmospheric particles, can influence the global radiation balance as strongly as
greenhouse gases and therefore play an important role in both local and global climate. PM 2.5
aerosol particles (i.e., those with diameter less than 2.5µm) are also the primary source of air pollu-
tant responsible for causing significant health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular
illnesses as well as lung cancer Beelen et al. (2013); Khomenko et al. (2021).
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is the column-integrated light extinction over an atmospheric column
i.e., a measure of the degree to which transmission of light through an atmospheric column is reduced
due to its scattering or absorption by aerosols. This can be expressed as:
AOD λ=Zz2
z1eλ(x, y, z, t )dz
where λis a particular wavelength. Surface PM 2.5mass concentrations have been found to be well-
correlated with AOD Wang & Christopher (2003); Yang et al. (2019), leading to significant research
directed towards estimating PM 2.5mass concentrations from AOD retrievals. High-resolution (HR)
GCM forecasts of AOD are therefore essential for understanding the effects of local-scale air pol-
lution on the climate, as well as for other downstream health-related applications. However, GCM
forecasts are limited in their spatial resolution by computational costs. Typically, these forecasts
operate at a global spatial resolution of 80-250km Iles et al. (2020), which is much higher than the
spatial scales over which AOD can vary, particularly in urban areas.
Image super-resolution (SR) is the problem of estimating a HR image from a lower-resolution coun-
terpart image and has a wide range of applications from video surveillance Aakerberg et al. (2021)
to medical diagnosis Chen et al. (2021). The problem is inherently ill-posed, and therefore challeng-
ing, since an infinite number of high-resolution images can be obtained from a single coarse-grained
image. SR is a highly researched field, with diverse approaches ranging from early interpolation
Zhang & Wu (2006); Keys (1981); Duchon (1979) and reconstruction Zhang et al. (2012); Dai et al.
(2009); Liu et al. (2016) approaches to ML-based approaches.
The SR of climate variables is referred to as downscaling . Vandal et al. (2017) pioneered the ap-
plication of ML for the task, utilizing a CNN to downscale satellite-observed precipitation data,

outperforming existing statistical methods. Consequently, ML has been established as the standard
approach for the task. The SR-ResNet Ledig et al. (2017); Lim et al. (2017), built on residual blocks,
has achieved state-of-the-art performance, in terms of restoration quality, for CNN approaches.
A limited number of studies have explored downscaling AOD . Wang et al. (2022) explored the
downscaling of monthly-averaged 50km-resolution AOD, coupled with elevation, to finer 10km-
resolution over a relatively large study area encompassing Southwest Asia. They utilise fully-
connected neural networks and ensure the preservation of inherent within-scale temporal correla-
tions. Li et al. (2020) utilise an SR-ResNet autoencoder to perform both gap-filling and 10x down-
scaling of weekly-averaged AOD in California, achieving impressive results. A recent study by
Zhang et al. (2022a) utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network to gap-fill coverage over China.
Contributions
This study evaluates a CNN approach for the spatial downscaling of global AOD satellite observa-
tions. We also evaluate the application of the developed approach to global AOD reanalysis data,
using comparison with in-situ AOD ground measurements to assess bias correction performance.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate AOD downscaling performance on a
global basis (i.e., its evaluation not restricted to a localised study area), as well as the first to apply
machine learning (ML) towards AOD bias correction.
This study focuses on AOD at the reference wavelength 550nm, hereinafter denoted AOD 550.

MODIS Level 2 (MOD04 L2) Satellite Data
MODIS Level 2 “MOD04 L2” AOD 550satellite data MODIS Atmosphere Science Team (2017) is
used for training the CNN framework. There are limited studies evaluating the global-scale perfor-
mance of MODIS AOD; these studies generally report a low positive bias at global scale, but with
large variability at regional scale Garrigues et al. (2022). A number of localised studies have shown
MODIS AOD products to outperform other AOD satellite data-products when validated against
ground-based measurements Payra et al. (2023); Handschuh et al. (2022); Garrigues et al. (2022).
The MOD04 L2 AOD data is produced at 10km (10x10 1-km at nadir) spatial resolution over both
land and ocean. Different AOD retrieval algorithms are employed for land retrievals (Dark Target)
and ocean retrievals (Deep Blue) in order to handle variations in surface reflectance Rubin & Collins
(2014). Further details on each algorithm can be found in Levy et al. (2007).
We obtained MOD04 L2 AOD 550swaths for the period 24/02/2000 to 19/07/2023 from the Centre
for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) archive. MOD04 L2 data is produced in sinusoidal pro-
jection. To facilitate later collocation of the data with validation datasets, the data is reprojected onto
a fixed regular latitude-longitude grid. The HR MODIS data is coarsened using average pooling to
generate the low-resolution (LR) input - HR target pairs required. The pooling results in LR inputs
at approx. 0.9◦resolution and HR targets at 0.09◦resolution.
Various methods have been explored in the literature for gap-filling MODIS AOD data Zhang et al.
(2022b); Kianian et al. (2021); Yang & Hu (2018). Here, we employed simple post-coarsening
mean imputation, with crops consisting of over 25% missing values discarded pre-imputation.
CAMS Reanalysis
To evaluate bias correction efficacy, Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanal-
ysis data is used. CAMS AOD data is reported to have a slightly higher positive bias at global
scale than MODIS MOD04 L2 Gueymard & Yang (2020). We obtained globaly daily CAMS
AOD 550data for a shorter period 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2016 using the ECMWF web API. The data
is produced on a fixed regular 0.75◦grid.
AERONET Station Measurements
The standard methodology for the validation of AOD estimates is to compare with in-situ
AERONET “ground-truth” measurement data. AERONET is a global network of multiwavelength
sun-photometry ground instruments providing measurements of AOD at point location. The AOD
retrieval algorithm is explained in Smirnov et al. (2000).
2Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
We obtained AERONET measurements for the shorter period 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2016 using the
AERONET web API. The measurements are obtained for selected stations (that have been identified
as well-maintained) to ensure a balanced global representation; a full list of the stations used, and
their details, can be found in Table 2 in the Supplementary Material.
AERONET retrieves AOD measurements at eight wavelengths between 340nm and 1020nm;
AOD 550, however, is not one of these and must be interpolated from neighbouring wavelengths Wang
et al. (2017); Gueymard & Yang (2020) using the ˚Angstr ¨om equation (and 440–870nm ˚Angstr ¨om
exponent). This assumes aerosol properties remain consistent within the measurement range.
The vertical profile of AOD is non-linear Stevens et al. (2017). Aerosols tend to be surface-
concentrated i.e., AOD at elevated sites is typically lower than at sites nearer sea level within the
same region. The pixel-mean surface elevation of each satellite/reanalysis grid cell and the elevation
of the AERONET station within that cell may differ significantly, particularly in regions of com-
plex terrain. Therefore, point-based AERONET measurements may not fully represent the aerosol
distribution within a model/satellite grid cell Su et al. (2017); Song et al. (2018); Shi et al. (2019);
Mukkavilli et al. (2019); He et al. (2019). This issue is exacerbated by lower grid cell resolution.
To mitigate this, we employed a fixed 2.1km (i.e., the approx. top altitude of the boundary layer)
scale-height correction when collocating AERONET measurements with gridded CAMS data.
3 M ETHODOLOGY
3.1 A RCHITECTURE
A modified SR-ResNet, based on the improved architecture presented by Lim et al. (2017) (with fur-
ther modifications by Harder et al. (2023)), is developed. This architecture employs a ”progressive
upsampling” framework in which resolution is increased in stages within the network; this approach
is more beneficial for large-factor (i.e., 10x) SR than pre- or post-upsampling approaches.
The network consists of two upsampling stages; the first stage performs an initial 5x upsampling
with the second performing the further 2x upsampling required. The upsampling is performed by
sub-pixel transpose convolutional layers. Each upsampling layer is followed by a set of residual
blocks with skip connections. As per Lim et al. (2017), batch normalisation layers within the residual
blocks are omitted. Unlike Lim et al., we maintained ReLU Agarap (2018) layers outside the residual
blocks, including in the final network layer, to constrain network outputs to be non-negative.
3.2 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP
The ResNet is trained with a learning rate of 1e−3and a batch size of 128. The Adam optimiser
(Kingma & Ba (2017)) is used, with β1= 0.9andβ2= 0.999. To deal with the inherent sparsity
of the HR target images, a modified Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function is used; this function
calculates the MSE between each downscaled output and HR target image exclusively for the non-
missing values in the target. We implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting using a monitor
on validation loss; the number of training epochs varies but typically converges around 70-90
(approx. 5 hours on a single Nvidia A100 GPU).
Owing to its established usage as a baseline in SR Shi et al. (2016); Liu et al. (2021); Shocher
et al. (2017) and downscaling studies Harder et al. (2023); Mu et al. (2020), Lanczos interpolation
is used as a non-trainable baseline for evaluation. This being the first study to evaluate global AOD
downscaling, there are unfortunately no existing ML baselines for further comparison.
4 R ESULTS
The metric scores for each downscaling approach (i.e., ResNet and baseline) applied to LR MODIS
AOD 550test set data are summarised in Table 1 below. As shown, our ResNet achieves signifi-
cantly improved performance over the baseline in terms of KGE and MSE. The correlation scores
on MODIS also show the ResNet-downscaled values to exhibit a stronger linear relationship with
the HR target values than those downscaled using the baseline. This suggests the ResNet is more
effective in capturing the inherent spatial patterns in the HR target data. However, the NMB scores
also reveal a larger positive bias resulting from the ResNet’s application, which is concerning for
3Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
bias correction performance as it suggests that the framework may have introduced/learned a biased
representation. The visual improvement from our ResNet is evident in Figure 1.
Table 1: Metric scores for baseline and ResNet on coarsened LR MODIS test set data (evaluated
against HR MODIS) and LR CAMS data (evaluated against AERONET). We report Kling-Gupta
Efficiency (KGE) Gupta et al. (2009), MSE, Normalised Mean Bias (NMB), and (Pearson’s) R.
The best scores for each objective are highlighted in bold.
MODIS (MOD04 L2) CAMS
HR DS (baseline) HR DS (ResNet) LR HR DS (baseline) HR DS (ResNet)
KGE 0.571 0.939 0.646 0.758 0.738
MSE 0.008 0.005 0.075 0.066 0.069
NMB 0.017 0.039 0.203 0.092 0.098
R 0.920 0.936 0.762 0.758 0.752
The metric scores for the evaluation of reanalysis-bias correction performance, with each downscal-
ing approach applied to CAMS data, are also summarized in Table 1. The improved performance
of both approaches over the non-downscaled LR CAMS data is evident across various metrics, with
the baseline showing marginally greater improvement than our CNN framework. However, both
approaches also exhibit weaker correlations with the HR target values than the LR data. These bias
correction results suggest that the ResNet is inadequately preserving the fidelity of the CAMS data
to AERONET, despite being trained on observation data with a purportedly lower bias.
This could be attributed to the gap-filling technique employed, which may have introduced a biased
representation of the MODIS training data, or inherent biases in the MODIS data itself. Fig 3 in the
Supplementary Material shows the output of each approach applied to CAMS; despite its inferior
numerical performance, the ResNet produces a slight visual improvement over the baseline.
Figure 1: Example outputs, from baseline and ResNet (CNN), on a MOD04 L2 test image. The
sparsity of the HR MODIS data is visible in the target image, while the LR image shows the results
of the coarsening and gap-filling procedures.
5 C ONCLUSION
In this study, we evaluated a ResNet-based approach for downscaling global AOD. The devel-
oped approach exhibited superior performance to an interpolation baseline when applied to MODIS
satellite-observed AOD data, achieving KGE of 0.939 compared to 0.571 for the baseline. However,
the evaluation also showed a larger positive bias resulting from the approach’s application, which
consequently did not outperform the baseline when applied to reanalysis data (KGE of 0.738 com-
pared to 0.758 for the baseline). This study can be considered an exploratory work, highlighting the
need for improved AOD satellite data as well as robust downscaling methods capable of better han-
dling the sparsity typical of HR satellite imagery. Future work could explore incorporating physical
constraining as part of the downscaling network Geiss et al. (2022); Harder (2022), regularization
through the temporal recurrence mechanisms, and the unsupervised fine-tuning of ML-based down-
scaling approaches on reanalysis/GCM data. The latter could help mitigate distribution shift issues
arising from using satellite data as a proxy when HR GCM data is unavailable.
