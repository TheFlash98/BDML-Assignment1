Abstract
Addressing the issues faced by climate change necessitates appropriate methodolo-
gies for evaluating climate policies, particularly when discussing long-term and
real-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) have altered artificial
intelligence, they ultimately fall short of connecting historical data with future
estimates. We propose an agentic LLM system that would address this gap by
considering and analyzing the probable outcomes of the user-specified climate
policy inside the practical settings. Further, we propose using knowledge graphs to
model the existing data about the impact of climate policies along with allowing
our system to access the data about future climate predictions. Done this way, the
model can peek into the past (previous policies) and the future (climate scenarios
forecast), paving the way for agencies to evaluate and design strategies and plans
for climate change more effectively.
1 Introduction
Climate change’s growing urgency has motivated a variety of stakeholders, including governments,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers, to develop and implement climate policies
aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions and strengthening resilience to climate effects [ 1].
However, these regulations usually emphasize short-term effectiveness and regulatory compliance,
frequently overlooking long-term consequences and the intricate interdependencies that characterize
climate systems [2].
Current Large Language Models (LLMs) represent tremendous advances in artificial intelligence
in recent years [ 3], but they have limits for assessing climate policy. Specifically, these models [ 4]
fall short of integrating the extensive diversity of information required for measuring policy success
[5], risking missing out on crucial aspects of a program’s influence [ 6]. Furthermore, many LLMs
must be trained to predict future climatic conditions precisely, complicating their capacity to produce
dependable long-term projections [7].
To address these difficulties we suggest using an agentic LLM system that can access and integrate
many sources of information, such as databases containing comprehensive future climate projections,
past policy data, and their results. This methodology seeks to bridge the significant gap in current
methodologies: inadequate integration of historical data with predictive climate modelling. While
current frameworks thoroughly examine previous policies [ 8], there is a noteworthy paucity of
instruments for accurately forecasting the impacts of future policies in the context of changing
climatic circumstances. Our suggested method bridges this gap, enabling agencies to make more
informed and effective climate policy decisions.

2 Proposed Solution
2.1 Knowledge Graphs
Our method will build Knowledge Graphs (KGs) [ 9] to produce a structured representation of past
climate policies, reports, and associated data. The LLM agent can better comprehend the links
between different policies, the conditions under which they were executed, and their subsequent
influence on climate variables if they can access a KG that captures all of this historical background.
This contextual awareness enables a more informed appraisal of future policy design, ensuring that
the LLM agent considers lessons from earlier endeavours.
Figure 1 depicts a KG node for "Continuous Monitoring of the Ecosystem and Data Generation"
in the Himalayan Ecosystem, with further information offered in a "summary" field created using
NMSHE Mission document2. This graph was generated using Graph Maker3. Integrating such
nodes into our KG improves the LLM’s capacity to analyze and anticipate the impact of new climate
policies.
2.2 Accessing Climate Forecasting Data
In addition to being able to access past data, we propose that our system should be able to access a
curated summary of data from climate forecasting models to evaluate the possible long-term effects
of the policies being evaluated. Our motivation for this is an open-source example of such an LLM
agent based system - climate-change-assistant4. It provides a summary of the climate data for any
geographic location worldwide for conditions such as heat, humidity, drought, precipitation, and
storms under various warming scenarios. Building on that idea, our system could potentially have
access to a diverse set of sources, such as ocean currents, air currents and any other geological data
relevant to the policy being evaluated.
2.3 Putting it all together
Integrating KGs (having information about past policies and future prediction) into the LLM agent
[10] provides a promising framework for assessing climate policy. This method allows for the
simultaneous examination of historical outcomes and future forecasts, resulting in more relevant
and successful evaluations of currently active climate policies. This tool allows policymakers to
investigate various policy alternatives, understand their possible consequences, and make educated
decisions that balance urgent requirements with long-term sustainability. The proposed LLM agent
promises a big step forward in climate policy evaluation by combining the capabilities of historical
data, predictive modelling, and sophisticated natural language processing.

2Figure 3: Workflow of the proposed Agentic LLM system for evaluating climate policy
Figure 2 depicts our proposed agentic LLM system that uses short-term and long-term memory
[11] to evaluate climate policy. Short-term memory stores the policy being assessed, and long-term
memory keeps data from climate predictions and prior policies.
Figure 3 illustrates the system’s process [ 12], which begins with user inquiries concerning a policy’s
long-term implications. The system next performs task planning, analyzing the query, followed by
model selection, which selects a model for each task. Finally, during execution, the system obtains
climatic projections and historical data to assess the policy’s efficacy.
3 Impact of the Proposed Solution
Integrating LLMs and KGs into the proposed framework has multiple advantages, including improved
analytical skills, the capacity to handle and process massive volumes of data, and the flexibility to
adapt to various policy circumstances. However, the computing resources required to maintain and
run such models are enormous, raising questions about their environmental impact. The suggested
LLM agent addresses these difficulties in two ways. First, the KG creation is a one-time process and
further, its structure could be standardized by allowing multiple sources of data to be combined in a
centralized open-source data repository. Second, since the creation of the KG already takes care of
building appropriate relationships in the past data, the LLM agent can attend to the most relevant
pieces in the data, do tailored analyses and ensure that computing resources are used efficiently while
maintaining assessment quality.
4 Conclusion
Our proposed agentic LLM system substantially contributes to climate policy evaluation by bridging
the gap between historical data and future estimates. By combining past policy reports with the future
using Knowledge Graph, the system provides a complete framework for evaluating the possible long-
term effects of climate policy. This technique helps policymakers make better judgments by offering
a more sophisticated knowledge of previous policy effects and projected future situations. As a result,
our system promises improvements in the accuracy and relevance of climate policy assessments. It
could help develop strategies that balance immediate goals with long-term sustainability, resulting in
more effective climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.
