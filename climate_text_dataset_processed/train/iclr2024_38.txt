ABSTRACT
The increasing frequency and intensity of drought events—periods of significant
decrease in water availability—are among the most alarming impacts of climate
change. Monitoring and detecting these events is essential to mitigate their impact
on our society. However, traditional drought indices often fail to accurately detect
such impacts as they mostly focus on single precursors. In this study, we leverage
machine learning algorithms to define a novel data-driven, impact-based drought
index reproducing as target the Vegetation Health Index, a satellite signal that di-
rectly assesses the vegetation status. We first apply novel dimensionality reduction
methods that allow for interpretable spatial aggregation of features related to pre-
cipitation, temperature, snow, and lakes. Then, we select the most informative and
non-redundant features through filter feature selection. Finally, linear supervised
learning methods are considered, given the small number of samples and the aim
of preserving interpretability. The experimental setting focuses on ten sub-basins
of the Po River basin, but the aim is to design a machine learning-based workflow
applicable on a large scale.
1 I NTRODUCTION
In recent years, climate change has gained increasing attention both in the media and within the
scientific community (Parmesan et al., 2022). An alarming consequence of climate change and global
warming is the rising frequency and intensity of droughts (Spinoni et al., 2016), defined as periods of
aridity and scarcity of water compared to normal conditions (Van Loon & Van Lanen, 2012), which
can have severe economic and ecological effects, impacting agriculture, water resources, tourism,
ecosystems, especially in regions lacking effective mitigation and drought management plans (Dai,
2011). In this scenario, the identification of drought-prone conditions and early detection are crucial
to mitigate their consequences.
Traditional standardized drought indices (e.g., SPI (Guttman, 1999), SPEI (Vicente-Serrano et al.,
2010)) are widely used to monitor drought conditions. However, they often fail to detect drought
impacts as they focus on specific drivers (e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration) without account-
ing for their complex interactions, that eventually generate the drought’s impacts. Ad hoc index
formulations have also been designed to identify drought conditions in specific basins (e.g., Estrela &
Vargas (2012)). However, these indices are basin-specific, with no capability to generalize and no
automatization of the process, requiring years of expert refinements. As an alternative, indices derived
from satellite data are available (e.g., NDVI (Pettorelli, 2013), VHI (Bento et al., 2018)) and allow
the direct observation of vegetation status in terms of colors, making them more suitable proxies of
its condition. Yet, these indices can only be observed in real-time, preventing their prediction weeks
to months in advance (Meehl et al., 2021) to timely prompt anticipatory operations.

Recent works applied Machine Learning to automatically derive data-driven drought indices, exploit-
ing classical indices as proxies of drought conditions (e.g., (Zaniolo et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2019;
Dikshit et al., 2021)). Building on these works, we apply a similar data-driven workflow in the Po
River basin (Italy), which is the largest Italian catchment and the most populated area of the country.
This region plays a central role in the national economy, and it is one of the largest agricultural areas
in Europe. In this context, we consider the remotely sensed Vegetation Health Index (V ogt et al., 2000,
VHI) as a proxy of the state of vegetation impacted by drought conditions. The novel contribution of
this work resides on the interpretability of each step of the ML workflow proposed. Indeed, this work
is the first empirical validation of recent dimensionality reduction algorithms (theoretically presented
in (Bonetti et al., 2024; 2023), designed to obtain interpretable spatially aggregated features. Then,
filter feature selection through conditional mutual information (CMI) is used to select the relevant and
non-redundant features as candidate drivers. Finally, linear supervised learning models are trained,
also considering a multi-task setting, in order to define a new data-driven, impact-based drought
index (i.e., the resulting model) reproducing the state of vegetation impacted by the drought. The
results show the effectiveness of the proposed workflow, whose main contribution is not only in terms
of regression performances but also in terms of index interpretability, which is essential to bridge
the gap between advanced ML methods (often considered as black-box algorithms) and the physical
meaning of the results.
2 D ATA
The VHI is a satellite index available in eight-day aggregations and 231m spatial resolution (Zellner &
Castelli, 2022). We worked on ten hydrological sub-basins (Figure 1a) of the Po River basin (Lehner
& Grill, 2013a), where urbanized regions were excluded to focus on cultivable areas only1. The target
of each sub-basin is, therefore, the eight-day average VHI value of cultivable areas, representing a
proxy of the state of vegetation.
The initial set of candidate drivers, i.e., input features, are meteorological features. Daily temperature
and cumulative precipitation (Cornes et al., 2018) have been considered since they are the core
variables of traditional drought indices. Then, daily snow depth cover (Hersbach et al., 2023) for
sub-basins that include mountainous areas have been added. Snow depth responds to temperature
fluctuations and can impact water availability through snowmelt, potentially mitigating or delaying
drought conditions. Finally, lake-related features, i.e., water level, inflow, and release, have also
been included since they may be indicators of prolonged water scarcity. Specifically, data from the
four largest lakes in the region - Lake Como, Lake Iseo, Lake Maggiore, and Lake Lugano - were
considered.
Starting from daily features, they have been aggregated into 8-day averages, matching the temporal
resolution of the target. Given the possible long-term impact and delayed effect, averaged variables
over 0,1,4,8,12,16,24weeks have been considered. Then, to take into account cyclo-stationarity
and remove seasonality, the average value (based on training set) of each feature associated with a
particular week has been removed to weekly measurement.
Since snow and lake features influence only a subset of the considered sub-basins, the main focus
of the analysis is on precipitation and temperature data. For these variables, we considered the
original grid points at different locations as individual features. In the considered domain, there are
991 distinct latitude-longitude grid points across the 10 sub-basins. Considering their 14 temporal
aggregations, we have a total of 14×991initial features. As a first novel contribution, we processed
this data using a novel data-driven feature aggregation algorithm combined with a filter feature
selection (see Section 3).
To validate our results, we also run a benchmark experiment that replaces the dimensionality reduction
step and directly calculates mean feature values for each variable in each sub-basin. In this case, we
obtain 14×10candidate drivers, which are the mean value of daily temperature and precipitation
anomalies over the area of each sub-basin, temporally averaged over 8-day intervals and over the
preceding 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 blocks of 8 days.

Given the availability of VHI data, the study period spans from January 2001 to December 2019,
for a total of 867samples. The dataset has been divided into training (2001-2009, 411samples),
validation (2010-2014, 228samples), and test set (2015-2019, 228samples).
3 E XTRACTION OF INTERPRETABLE RELEVANT FEATURES
Dimensionality Reduction This work builds upon three recent dimensionality reduction ap-
proaches, LinCFA, NonLinCFA, and GenLinCFA (Bonetti et al., 2024; 2023)), designed to identify
groups of features that are convenient, in terms of MSE, to aggregate with their mean. In this way,
the interpretability of the reduced features is preserved, as they are averages of a subset of features.
Iteratively, these algorithms compare pairs of features and aggregate them with the mean, depending
on a threshold based on correlation (we refer the interested reader to the original papers for further
details). Linear Correlated Features Aggregation (LinCFA) assumes linear relationships between the
features and the target. Non-Linear Correlated Features Aggregation (NonLinCFA) is an extension
of LinCFA designed assuming that the target is a nonlinear function of the features, with additive
Gaussian noise, which is more realistic. Finally, Generalized Linear Correlated Features Aggregation
(GenLinCFA) is a further extension that assumes that the distribution of the target belongs to the
canonical exponential family, making the algorithm applicable in classification settings.
We apply these algorithms to the temperature and precipitation data described in Section 2, where
991 values of each feature at different locations are available. Specific heuristics have also been
introduced in our implementation. In particular, only features belonging to the same sub-basin, with
neighboring locations, and representing the same variable (e.g., temperature) over the same timescale
(e.g., 24 weeks) can be aggregated together. Additionally, an internal aggregation order prioritizing
pairs of features with the highest correlation has been added to avoid variability due to random
ordering. In conclusion, the reduced features produced are averages across neighboring grid points
within the same region of the same variable, where the most promising features (the most correlated
ones) are first checked for aggregation. Figure 1b visually shows the aggregations identified by the
NonLinCFA algorithm, considering the 1-week aggregated cumulative precipitation feature in a
specific sub-basin. It reveals the identification of different sub-regions and the extraction of a total of
17 features, starting from 172 original ones. A further classification analysis applying GenLinCFA
has been performed and it is described in the appendix.
Feature Selection Feature selection based on CMI has subsequently been applied to identify
relevant and non-redundant features, i.e., drivers of drought conditions. The supervised filter algorithm
considered selects features in a forward or backward manner, it is model independent, and provides
theoretical guarantees on the loss of information (Beraha et al., 2019). We apply forward CMI feature
selection to each sub-basin, using the corresponding VHI as target and the features obtained from
dimensionality reduction as inputs. Additionally, in the benchmark experiment, feature selection
is applied directly to averaged features. In both cases, we identify the five most relevant features
for each sub-basin, selected according to their performance on the validation set. As an additional
benchmark, we explored a forward wrapper feature selection method. Our results (see Appendix)
show that the CMI-based approach performs comparably or even better than the wrapper method,
with the advantage of being model-independent. This preserves the interpretability of the selected

candidate drivers since it would not be physically meaningful to select different meteorological
variables as drivers of the same drought condition depending on the ML model considered.
4 I DENTIFICATION OF DATA -DRIVEN ,IMPACT -BASED DROUGHT INDICES
The relevant features selected by the approach described in the previous section are used as inputs
for simple supervised learning models to reconstruct the target VHI in each sub-basin. A multi-task
variation was also explored, grouping the ten sub-basins into three clusters based on VHI correlations
and DBSCAN clustering (Figure 1c). The clusters are also meaningful in terms of proximity and
hydrological characteristics. In this case, a linear model was trained for each cluster, considering
input features from all its basins and a bias term through one-hot encoding, which associates each
sample to the related sub-basin. This multi-task approach provides benefits such as increased sample
size and reduced number of models.
Table 1 illustrates the results, in terms of coefficient of determination ( R2), for single-task and multi-
task linear regressions (first row), compared with two baselines: a linear regression that considers
the average of each feature as input (second row) and a linear regression that considers as input Soil
Moisture Anomaly (Bergman et al., 1988, SMA). This way, the proposed workflow is compared with a
model that does not consider NonLinCFA algorithm and another one based on an agricultural drought
index. The results highlight improvements with the proposed workflow, especially in the multi-task
setting. In most cases, the test R2is above 0.2, showing that we are extracting a significantly positive
amount of information, although we do not achieve test scores higher than 0.35, which may depend
on the small number of samples, the difficulty of the task (e.g., the score associated with SMA is
always close to 0), and the fact that we are testing on 5years in the future w.r.t. the training set.
More complex ML models, such as feed-forward neural networks and random forests, have also been
considered. However, we did not find significant improvements, which may depend on the limited
amount of data samples. Additionally, linear models have been preferred to comply with the goal of
preserving the interpretability of the results. Also, the addition of snow depth and lake-related features
does not enhance the accuracy of the models, suggesting that their contribution is not significantly
complementary to precipitation and temperature. We also considered a classification setting where the
target represents the presence of drought conditions. Accuracy scores, considering logistic regression,
are reported in the appendix.
5 C ONCLUSIONS
This work addresses drought detection through the reconstruction of a data-driven index, considering
meteorological features as input variables and a satellite signal measuring the state of the vegetation
as target. The implemented ML pipeline includes a first empirical validation of recent dimensionality
reduction algorithms, combined with filter feature selection and a linear multi-task learning approach.
The test scores obtained are overall satisfactory, given the complexity of the problem and the small
number of samples, although they may be improved in future work. The main contribution of
this work is not only in the direction of obtaining an accurate prediction, but to the preservation
of interpretability. The resulting indices are linear combinations of drivers selected among a set
of features that have been extracted as averages of subsets of original meteorological variables at
neighbouring locations. Therefore, these data-driven indices are physically interpretable, and they
can be therefore analyzed by domain experts. Future work will focus on testing a broader application
4Published as a workshop paper at "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2024
of the proposed pipeline at the European scale to assess its capability to automatize the data-driven
extraction of drought indices on a larger domain.

This appendix section provides additional details on the data considered for this work.
The focus of this study is the area of the Po River basin, as illustrated in Figure 2a. Within this region,
we have identified ten primary hydrological sub-basins whose labels are in the figure legend. These
sub-basins are established based on the partition of hydrological levels 7 and 8, among those detailed
in (Lehner & Grill, 2013b).

The chosen target signal for this drought detection case study is the VHI. Firstly, we examined
the autocorrelation and stationarity properties of the VHI time series. Our analysis confirmed
the stationarity of the signal, as it passed both the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) (Dickey &
Fuller, 1979) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) (Kwiatkowski et al., 1992) tests.
Furthermore, the VHI time series exhibited an autoregressive behaviour characterized by various
orders of autocorrelation. This autoregressive nature was supported by the accuracy of autoregressive
model predictions, which were compared against the actual test signal (Figure 3), and by the results of
the Ljung-Box test (Ljung & Box, 1978) applied to the residuals. The absence of correlation among
residuals indicates that they behave like white noise.
Figure 3: VHI target predictions of AR(1) model with respect to the true signal.
However, the primary objective of this work is not to reconstruct the signal precisely but rather to
leverage it for the data-driven detection of features that influence its fluctuations. As a result, we
focused on building models for signal reconstruction based on meteorological data.
Our main dataset comprises cumulative precipitation and daily temperature features, available in
a gridded format and covering the entire region of interest. As an example, Figure 2b displays
temperature feature values without temporal aggregations on a specific week. These values undergo a
cyclostationary transformation during preprocessing. For this reason, red points indicate a higher
anomaly compared to the mean for that specific week of the year and coordinate, whereas blue points
indicate a lower anomaly, meaning values close to the mean for that point during that time of year.
From this plot, we can observe how feature values exhibit significant variations even within the same
sub-basin. The benchmark experiment, introduced in Section 2, does not account for these variations,
7Published as a workshop paper at "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2024
as it computes a single mean feature per sub-basin by averaging all values. Dimensionality reduction
methods, instead, enable the identification of similar areas and facilitate the selection of the most
informative ones with respect to the VHI target of a specific sub-basin.
In addition to cumulative precipitation and daily temperature, we incorporated data related to snow
depth and lakes in our feature set. Specifically, snow data are available in a grid format and are
considered only at points where snowfall occurs at least sporadically, as illustrated in Figure 4a.
Regarding the lakes, we utilized information related to water level, inflow and release. Figure 4b
displays the locations of the considered lakes.

B M ETHODS AND RESULTS
This second appendix section provides further details and results of the ML methodology followed to
address the detection task.
As described in the main paper, after the extraction and analysis of the target and feature variables,
we followed the workflow visually summarized in the block scheme in Figure 5. The initial step
involves applying the discussed dimensionality reduction techniques to spatio-temporal features.
Subsequently, feature selection using the CMI approach is performed on the spatially aggregated
features obtained in the previous step. These selected features are then employed in the final phase,
where supervised learning models are trained to reconstruct the VHI target. For the regression task,
Figure 5: Block scheme of the workflow of the conducted experiments.
the models were trained with features derived from the NonLinCFA dimensionality reduction method,
considering a continuous target. NonLinCFA spatially aggregates variable values across all basin
points, employing a theoretical threshold to decide which points to merge together and replace by
their mean. Following this, feature selection methods are applied to identify the most informative
and non-redundant inputs among the spatial aggregations generated for each temporal aggregation of
each variable. A practical example of the results for a sub-basin is provided in Figure 6. Here, each
row refers to one of the top 5 features selected by the forward CMI feature selection algorithm. The
feature names are reported above each plot, with tgdenoting daily temperature variables, rrreferring
to cumulative precipitation ones and nwindicating that each value of that feature is the average of
that variable nweeks before. In particular, the left column displays all spatial aggregations generated
8Published as a workshop paper at "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2024
using the NonLinCFA algorithm for the respective feature. These aggregations represent new features
derived from averaging the variable values across all the data points included in each aggregation.
The right column, instead, shows only the aggregation selected as one of the most relevant during the
feature selection phase. We can observe how NonLinCFA identifies a variety of different aggregations
based on the similarity between points, which can be easily visualized and analyzed.
Figure 6: Aggregations on Emiliani2 basin using the NonLinCFA algorithm and selecting the first 5
features from forward CMI feature selection.
The models were trained both in single-task and multi-task settings. As illustrated in Figure 1c, three
clusters of basins have been identified based on their similarity. For multi-task training, all the chosen
features from each basin within a cluster are employed as inputs for the model. Additionally, we
incorporate a one-hot encoding to provide the model with information about which sub-basin each
sample belongs to. An example of the obtained dataframe is displayed in Figure 7.
Table 2 is an extended version of Table 1, where also results from wrapper feature selection methods
have been included.
Input features derived from the wrapper feature selection method slightly improved performance in
single-task contexts for certain sub-basins, such as Emiliani2 andGarda Mincio . However, the most
favourable results in the multi-task setting are usually achieved by employing features selected through
the CMI-based feature selection method. This is exemplified by the performance leap observed for
theEmiliani2 sub-basin in the single-task context, which is compensated in the multi-task scenario,
where the CMI score surpasses the one obtained with the wrapper method. This empirically validates
the robust generalization capability of features chosen based on CMI with respect to the ones obtained
through the wrapper feature selection method, which is more computationally expensive and related
to the specific trained model.
The last column of Table 2 refers to the benchmark results obtained with features averaged across the
entire sub-basin area. Notably, the application of NonLinCFA results in improvements, particularly
pronounced in the multi-task setting. Some sub-basins such as Dora ,Piemonte Sud , and Piemonte

Nord proved to be more challenging to address, possibly due to the specific mountainous precipitation
configurations and to the small number of cultivable areas available.

column, where CMI has been applied to features averaged across the whole sub-basin.
The outcomes that were detailed in the single-task and multi-task regression scenarios are also
presented in the context of binary classification. In this case, we evaluated the model performance in
distinguishing between Good andBad classes, respectively, referring to unfavourable and favourable
conditions for drought appearance. The binary target was derived by categorizing the VHI signal into
these two classes, and we explored various thresholds to perform this division in the most effective
and significant way. Table 3 provides an overview of the accuracy scores obtained through the logistic
regression model and the GenLinCFA dimensionality reduction method, leveraging daily temperature
and cumulative precipitation features. While the scores in this context exhibit a coarser granularity,
and the deviation from the benchmark (achieved by averaging features across entire sub-basins) and
from the wrapper feature selection results is less pronounced, the performance remains consistently
comparable. In addition, the results are achieved using faster, model-independent, and interpretable
algorithms, which still make it competitive.

The identical experiments were replicated while incorporating the snow depth and lake-related
features, and the results are presented in Table 4. For this analysis, we focused only on sub-basins
where these additional features were available, excluding the Emiliani1 - Emiliani2 - Garda Mincio
cluster, which is predominantly flat and far from the considered lakes. The Piemonte Nord - Piemonte
Sud - Dora cluster was also omitted since it does not contain the designated lakes.
When included, snow depth and lake behaviour features were identified as informative by the feature
selection methods. However, their inclusion did not lead to a significant enhancement in the R2scores
for regression. This observation indicates that while these features do provide valuable information,
their contribution is not significantly complementary to that of precipitation and temperature data.
Consequently, incorporating these features did not result in a noteworthy improvement in prediction
performance, although we were able to extract useful information from them.
