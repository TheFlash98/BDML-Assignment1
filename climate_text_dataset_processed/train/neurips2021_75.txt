Abstract 
Hydrological extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are highly destructive natural disasters 1 
and its occurrence is expected to increase under the future climate change. Accurate and efficient 2 
approach to detect such events will provide timely information to assist management strategies for 3 
minimizing socio-economic damages. Despite the threshold approach has established to detect 4 
extreme events, the missing data from hydroclimate data and accurately identifying these events 5 
are still major challenges. The advent of machine learning models can help to identify the 6 
occurrence of droughts and floods events accurately and efficiently. Therefore, this proposed study 7 
will develop a machine learning model with semi-supervised anomaly detection approach to 8 
identify hydrological extreme events with ground-based data. As a test case, we will use 45-years 9 
record of hydroclimate data in coastal California, where was the driest region in 2012-2015, 10 
following with flash floods events. The expected results will increase communities’ awareness for 11 
hydrological extreme events and enable environmental planning and resource management under 12 
climate change 13 
1.Introduction 14 
Droughts and floods are hydrological extreme events, and most devastating types of natural 15 
disasters under the impact from climate change. These events lead to severe socio-economic 16 
impacts in climate sensitive regions of the world. Management strategies that minimize the socio-17 
economic impacts of floods and droughts can be more effective when we can detect the 18 
occurrence of droughts and floods accurately. Under future climate projection scenarios, the 19 
frequency of extreme droughts and floods has been increased [6]. Thus, there is an urgent need to 20 
accurately detect the occurrence of droughts and floods recently under global climate change.  21 
 22 
Droughts and floods are different physical processes but identifying these events can be done 23 
similarly. For example, we can identify droughts and floods events using extreme value theory 24 
with threshold approaches. Floods can be detected by using the peak streamflow volume over 25 
threshold or as annual maxima events, while droughts can be detected by using hydrological 26 
events below a given threshold of deficit stream volume or annual minimum events. However, this 27 
approach is sensitive to the selection of threshold level [2] over different years and may produce 28 
detection error for extreme events. Additionally, hydroclimate data from either ground-based or 29 
satellite products tends to suffer from missing data issue. The Long Short Term-Memory (LSTM) 30 
autoendocers approach has provided the advance power for reconstructing data signals to remedy 31 
missing data issue [7].    32 
 33 
Given that hydrological extreme events are anomalous events, machine learning (ML)-based 34 
anomaly detection can be a promising approach to identify such events. ML-based anomaly 35 
detection methods provide an automated and accurate manner, which can save more time than 36 
threshold-based approach and human manually identify extreme events. ML-based anomaly 37 
detection methods are largely classified into supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. 38 2 
 Due to the dynamic of floods and droughts, there are supervised learning (support vector machine, 39 
extreme machine learning) and unsupervised learning (LSTM auencoders) approaches were used 40 
commonly to detect these extreme events [1,3]. Although these approaches can detect extreme 41 
events efficiently, there is still needs to improve the accuracy of the performances. However, a 42 
recent study that aimed to detect extreme events in water usage shows that a semi-supervised 43 
learning outlier detection can outperform the unsupervised learning approaches [5]. This suggests 44 
that floods and droughts detection could be improved further with semi-supervised learning 45 
outliner detection.  46 
 47 
The main goal of this proposal is to develop a ML-based anomaly detection model with semi-48 
supervised approaches to improve the extreme events detection. We will design this model in such 49 
way that a) we can easily apply this model to any other region and b) we can run this model with 50 
future climate projection scenarios. Our proposed modeling would serve as an early warning 51 
system for natural disaster response.   52 
 53 
Contributions:  We will examine the unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection 54 
approaches for extreme events from ground-based hydroclimate data. We will perform a semi-55 
supervised anomaly detection by obtaining labels from annual maxima and minima approaches. 56 
We will also compare several ML-based anomaly detections with threshold approaches to check 57 
the performance of extreme events identification. 58

2. Modeling Approaches 60 
We will examine the central coastal California watersheds, where were the driest areas during the 61 
California drought (2012-2015) and followed with many flash floods events. For this, we obtained 62 
the rainfall gauges data from Santa Barbara County (https://rain.cosbpw.net/) and streamflow 63 
gauge data from USGS (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis/) and SBC LTER project 64 
(https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/). Both rainfall and streamflow gauges data are with the 65 
time from 1980 to 2015.  We also obtained other meteorological data such as evapotranspiration 66 
and relative humidity from CIMIS stations from 1990 to present (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). 67

2.1 Machine Learning Model Approach 69 
In this proposal, we will examine several modeling approaches for anomaly detection. One hybrid 70 
LSTM network-based anomaly detection is proposed since the decoding function can reconstruct 71 
the input feature signals with fixed data length (Figure 1). Then, using the threshold approach as a 72 
benchmark, we will compare different ML models to select the best-performing model that 73 
identifies extreme events accurately. The overall description of our proposed modeling system is 74 
shown in Figure 2. 75 
The modeling approaches for anomaly detection used in this study are as follows:  76 
 Threshold approaches: typically, the peakflow volume over threshold and the deficit 77 
flow volume below a given threshold are used to identify extreme events. This approach 78 
requires ensuring independence between events. 79 
 LSTM autoencoders (unsupervised anomaly detection) : for anomaly detection, this 80 
model is trained to reconstruct signals by minimizing this objective function. When data 81 
points have high  reconstruction errors, this can be treated as anomalous data based on a 82 
threshold value [4]. 83 
 LSTM based semi-supervised anomaly detection: this approach first retrieves a few 84 
labels as extreme events based on annual maxima and minima approaches. A  LSTM 85 
network is used for reconstructing data signals into fixed data lengths. For anomaly 86 
detection, a constraint-based clustering is performed with a few labels on reconstructed 87 
data. Then, we assign an initial score based on each data position with respect to the 88 3 
 grouped data distribution. If there are some labels, each data’s anomaly score will be 89 
updated based on nearby data’s labels. 90

3. Conclusion  99 
This proposal offers a novel modeling approach for detecting hydrological extreme events by 100 
using semi-supervised anomaly detection with LSTM neural networks. Our semi-supervised 101 
anomaly detection approach will be based on the real extreme event signal labels with a clustering 102 
model. This approach with a few labels represents droughts and floods can improve the anomalous 103 
data identification than unsupervised approach This proposal will establish a modeling framework 104 
that extracts the extreme events signals (droughts and floods) from long-term hydroclimate data 105 
under global climate change in an accurate and efficient manner. With the improved detection 106 
accuracy and its low computing cost, our modeling framework can be used as a decision-making 107 
tool of management strategies for environmental planners, agriculture, insurance sectors and 108 
investors. Also, communities’ awareness is increased by informing the potential disaster risks 109 
from climate-fueled drought and flood. 110
