Abstract
Around the world, there are millions of unplugged abandoned oil and gas wells, 1
leaking methane into the atmosphere. The locations of many of these wells, as 2
well as their greenhouse gas emissions impacts, are unknown. Machine learning 3
methods in computer vision and remote sensing, such as semantic segmentation, 4
have made it possible to quickly analyze large amounts of satellite imagery to detect 5
salient information. This project aims to automatically identify undocumented 6
oil and gas wells in the province of Alberta, Canada to aid in documentation, 7
estimation of emissions and maintenance of high-emitting wells. 8
1 Problem and Motivation 9
Around the world, millions of abandoned oil and gas wells exist in a kind of limbo, often the creation 10
of companies that are now defunct. Decades later, such wells continue to be a major environmental 11
hazard - by contaminating surrounding ecosystems, the groundwater used by the communities around 12
them and contributing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere equivalent to millions of tons of carbon 13
dioxide every year [12]. 14
The number of abandoned wells continues to grow each year. There are approximately 400,000 15
abandoned wells in Canada alone – with the estimate being ten times higher in the United States [ 12]. 16
While databases exist for the locations of some abandoned wells, the locations of the majority of such 17
wells remains unknown. For example, the number of wells recorded by the Pennsylvania Department 18
of Environmental Protection is only about a tenth of the total number of wells estimated to exist in 19
the state [ 5]. An understanding of their environmental impacts is similarly incomplete, with these 20
undocumented wells described as the most uncertain source of methane emissions in Canada [12]. 21
This project aims to leverage machine learning to (1) identify the existence and locations of previously 22
undocumented oil and gas wells in Alberta, and (2) precisely localize and correct inaccurate locations 23
of known abandoned oil and gas wells. The geospatial information we obtain will aid experts in 24
efforts to monitor, assess, and plug such wells, plugging being the process wherein a well bore is 25
ﬁtted with a cement plug to prevent contamination and further methane leakage. In future work, we 26
aim to automatically monitor and create more precise methane inventories from abandoned oil and 27
gas wells and accelerate the identiﬁcation process of especially high methane-emitting wells. 28
2 Background and Related Work 29
Semantic segmentation is a fundamental and well-established task in computer vision. This pixel-wise 30
classiﬁcation technique has been used in a variety of data-abundant remote sensing problems, includ- 31
ing tasks using multi-band hyperspectral satellite imagery, such as tree and vegetation classiﬁcation 32

Program [3]
[11], crop cover and type analysis [ 14] and environmental monitoring [ 1]. In addition, segmentation 33
techniques have been used in geolocalization tasks such as improving localization and mapping on 34
slums and small-scale urban structures [13]. 35
The U-Net [ 8] is a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with a symmetric encoder-decoder archi- 36
tecture. This particular architecture contains an expanding decoder path to enable precise localization 37
and recovery of object details [ 8,10]. Originally developed for medical image segmentation, the 38
U-Net has been used in a variety of other problems, such as road extraction [ 15] and greenhouse 39
detection [4], thanks to its success at performing image segmentation with minimal training data. 40
However, limited work has been done to semantically identify and localize oil and gas infrastructure 41
wells. To date, such efforts have been purely applied on the detection of active oil and gas wells 42
with large spatial features, including large identiﬁable machinery and infrastructure that span up to 43
kilometers, using low to medium resolution satellite imagery [ 6,9]. Conversely, abandoned oil and 44
gas wells are only a few meters large at most, requiring high resolution satellite imagery for detection. 45
3 Proposed Approach 46
Our machine learning methodology is intended to localize abandoned wells from satellite imagery. 47
Speciﬁcally, we will use U-Net-inspired neural networks, which allow fully convolutional implemen- 48
tations that can rapidly process large areas in parallel [ 8]. These methods will be trained using partial 49
data on over 200,000 well locations available from the AER-ST37 database provided by the Alberta 50
Energy Regulator and high-resolution, multi-band, geospatial Skysat satellite imagery from Planet 51
Labs, on the scale of 0.5m per pixel, to detect features of a small spatial size. Training images will 52
consist of satellite imagery around each datapoint representing a well (from the AER-ST37 dataset). 53
Our neural networks will be trained to output binary masks with each pixel labelled as belonging 54
to the well class or not well class – with every pixel within a ﬁxed radius of a well’s point location 55
labeled as “well” and every pixel outside labeled as “not well” (see Figure 2). 56
The immediate output of the classiﬁer will be a prediction mask of probabilities. From this, the 57
relevant information (locations of the predicted wells) can be distilled in one of two ways: (1) by 58
clustering pixels classiﬁed as “well” and outputting as a well any cluster that exceeds a given number 59
of pixels, or (2) for every location, summing the probabilities of “well’ at neighboring pixels within a 60
given radius and outputting as a well any location that exceeds a given threshold. 61
A methodological issue we anticipate is in the dataset containing imbalanced data – many more 62
negative examples than positive ones, since the majority of pixels in satellite imagery are clearly not 63
abandoned wells. To mitigate this, we plan on enforcing a relatively balanced training dataset, then 64
optimally selecting thresholds to compensate for imbalanced data during test time. 65
Our methods will not only be used to detect previously unknown abandoned well locations, but to give 66
much more accurate locations for known wells that are already present in the database; these locations 67
are currently known only very imprecisely, with errors of up to kilometers, thereby complicating 68
on-the-ground assessments, monitoring, maintenance, and plugging of such wells. We anticipate that 69
our algorithm will pinpoint some currently active wells along with abandoned wells, due to visual 70
similarity; these can be ﬁltered out in post-processing, given that information on active wells is more 71
complete than that for abandoned wells. 72
2It is worth noting that since some of the locations given in the database for abandoned wells are 73
incorrect, some of the labels given to the neural network will be inaccurate to varying degrees. 74
However, we anticipate that the neural network will able to ignore certain amounts of label noise (see, 75
e.g., [7]), and that there is a sufﬁcient amount of fully accurate labels for effective training.

the white polygon (“Not Well” pixels) includes negative examples for the classiﬁer.

4 Future Work 77
In a future stage of this project, the focus will be on the ability of the algorithm to generalize to 78
various geographical regions. While this model will be developed using data from Alberta, there 79
are undocumented wells in other Canadian provinces and countries, notably in the United States 80
and many countries of the former Soviet Union. We will use meta-learning methodologies such as 81
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) [ 2] to generalize effectively between multiple regions with 82
minimal additional data. 83
Another future stage of this project moves beyond localization of abandoned oil and gas wells to 84
quantiﬁcation of methane leakage. Exact estimates of methane leakage from wells is an exceptionally 85
hard problem without specialized measurements, such as hyperspectral imagery (which is difﬁcult in 86
the case of abandoned wells since individual wells tend to yield diffused plumes). Active learning 87
techniques will be used to sending expert ground-truth teams to speciﬁc wells to determine methane 88
concentration levels. While such measurements are time-intensive, far fewer ﬁeld measurements will 89
need to be taken thanks to this technique. 90
We collaborate closely with a team of civil engineers in the Subsurface Hydrology and Geochemistry 91
Research Group at McGill University, who specialize in assessing methane emissions from abandoned 92
oil and gas wells and have monitored such wells extensively across the globe. The process of 93
automatic well identiﬁcation, and future steps for methane emissions quantiﬁcation, will be used by 94
these collaborators to better understand these wells, their impacts, the creation of more complete 95
database records – in addition to maintaining, plugging, and conducting ﬁeld assessments on these 96
wells. 97
