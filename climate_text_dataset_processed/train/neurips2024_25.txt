Abstract
CO2emissions from power plants, as significant super emitters, contribute substan-
tially to global warming. Accurate quantification of these emissions is crucial for
effective climate mitigation strategies. While satellite-based plume inversion offers
a promising approach, challenges arise from data limitations and the complexity of
atmospheric conditions. This study addresses these challenges by (a) expanding
the available dataset through the integration of NO 2data from Sentinel-5P, gener-
ating continuous XCO 2maps, and incorporating real satellite observations from
OCO-2/3 for over 71 power plants in data-scarce regions; and (b) employing a
customized U-Net model capable of handling diverse spatio-temporal resolutions
for emission rate estimation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements
in emission rate accuracy compared to previous methods [11]. By leveraging
this enhanced approach, we can enable near real-time, precise quantification of
major CO 2emission sources, supporting environmental protection initiatives and
informing regulatory frameworks.
1 Introduction
Over the past two decades, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from burning fossil fuels by electricity
industry has increased its carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by 53% worldwide [13]. Experts expect
that more than half of all future carbon emissions will come from this sector [15]. Understanding
power plant emissions ("super emitters"), especially in regions where proper accounting mechanisms
are lacking, is crucial for identifying sources and quantifying emissions to support carbon-neutrality
pathways. Estimation of carbon emissions to the atmosphere has generally been performed using
two complementary approaches: “bottom-up” and “top-down” methods [6]. Bottom-up methods
aggregate source-specific CO 2flux estimates to form a total emission inventory based on activity
data and emission models [8]. These inventories can be highly resolved in both space and time, but
they are prone to systematic errors, and their uncertainties are not well known [1] and their time lags
for more than years with respect to real time is another concern. Top-down methods infer quantitative
information on surface CO 2fluxes from variations in atmospheric CO 2concentration observations
through inverse modeling with atmospheric tracer transport models [16]. Recently, there has been
an increase in atmospheric observations through satellite observations [3], driven by the growing
number of dedicated satellites, advancements in sensor technology, and improved spatial resolution.
This has heightened interest in using atmospheric observations to derive CO 2emissions. Traditional
inverse modeling systems, often relying on Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Models (LPDMs), are
a popular approach to quantify CO 2emission rates using atmospheric observations [7]. However,
increased volume of atmospheric observations strained the computational capacity of these traditional
methods along with challenges remain in the spatial allocation of emissions due to uncertainties in
prior fluxes and atmospheric transport models.
In recent years, efforts have been made to use data-driven learning approaches to detect plumes and
their shapes, and then invert CO 2plumes from major emission sources. However, many studies
rely on simulated data to learn the complex concentration-to-flux conversion, and there are very
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.few studies exploring similar techniques using observed data from satellites [11]. To enhance the
current data-driven understanding, three main challenges must be addressed: (1) Observed data from
satellites, such as carbon dioxide concentration (XCO 2) measurements, are often limited, with only
10% of the data being clean and temporally very sparse [12]. (2) The robustness and generalizability
of data-driven approaches are limited when only simulated data are used, due to inconsistencies in
emission distributions and the lack of data representing diverse power plant profiles. Additionally,
CO2plumes are notoriously difficult to invert due to various factors such as missing data and signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) issues. (3) Super emitters, like power plants, do not report emissions in a timely
manner or at a fine temporal frequency, which poses a labeling challenge for supervised learning
models aimed at learning emission rates at finer temporal resolutions. In this work, we aim to address
(a) the sparsity of satellite observation data by employing a machine learning approach, (b) create a
novel dataset by merging simulated data with satellite observations, and finally (c) customize a U-Net
model for learning CO 2concentration-to-flux conversion for power plant emission rates.
2 Model to Estimate Emission Rate
We have employed two distinct deep learning architectures to estimate CO 2emission rates for power
plants: the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the U-Net regression model. Each architecture
is tailored to capture spatial patterns and relationships within the input data, aiming to enhance the
accuracy of emissions predictions. We briefly summarize these models below:
Baseline Model - CNN: The CNN model as adapted from [11] uses a multi-layered architecture
consisting of convolution layers that detect features, max-pooling for dimensionality reduction and
retaining key features, batch normalization for training stability and dropout to prevent over-fitting.
The final dense layer with Leaky ReLU activation produces the predictions. This model serves as the
baseline for our performance evaluation.
Proposed U-Net Regression Model: The U-Net architecture includes an encoder-decoder structure
that efficiently handles feature extraction and spatial context preservation. The model used for the
regression task has been shown in the Figure 1a where the encoder captures contextual information
progressively through a series of convolution, pooling layers, batch normalization and dropout (0.2)
layers to train the model [14]. The output of the decoder layer is taken as input into a final dense
layer to predict the emission rate. To assess the performance of the model, we used several metrics:
Absolute Error, Absolute Relative Error, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE), and R2values. Each metric helped evaluate how well the model performed on the same test
dataset.

3 Power Plant Emission: Data and Results
Proposed Satellite observations data: Satellite observations XCO 2, derived from the combined data
of OCO2/3 satellites and subject to rigorous quality control, often exhibit sparse spatial and temporal
distribution. To facilitate effective analytics, continuous, gridded XCO 2maps with regular temporal
frequency are essential. Therefore, we have implemented a machine learning approach, analogous to
the method presented in [5], to generate daily XCO 2maps with a spatial resolution of 1km ×1km
across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) data utilized in this study
were sourced from Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) Level 3 Offline

(OFFL) satellite imagery (COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_NO2), offering a spatial resolution of
3.5km×5.5km and daily temporal frequency. However, due to cloud cover and other factors, the data
contained missing values. To generate regular gridded maps without missing data, we implemented
a series of post-processing steps designed to fill missing values and enhance spatial resolution
to 1km×1km using appropriate downscaling approach [10]. High-resolution meteorological data
was obtained from TWC sources [2], providing hourly weather variables at a spatial resolution of
4km×4km. To align with the desired spatial resolution of 1km ×1km, we downscaled wind velocities
using interpolation techniques. For the KSA region, KAUST University published a dataset based
on a bottom-up approach, reporting the annual emissions for 71 power plants in 2020, along with
their geolocations [9]. To create power plant-specific datasets for model training, validation, and
testing, we used the power plant geolocations as the centroid pixel and created 64 ×64 patch size
images with XCO 2, NO 2, and both wind velocity components at a daily frequency. CO 2emissions
are represented as a scalar value for each power plant, indicating the annual emission rate. We have
disaggregated this annual rate to a daily level using a truncated version of the approach outlined in
[4]. To achieve this, we used daily trace gas measurements, energy production data, and weather
profiles. Daily feature images and target emission rates for each power plant were merged to create
satellite observation data for the KSA region.
Simulated data: The existing dataset was taken from the previous paper [11] which comprised of
simulated satellite imagery and atmospheric variables, including column average of carbon dioxide
concentration (XCO 2), wind speed fields (u and v compoents), and nitrogen dioxide concentration
(NO 2). These measurements span multiple power plant regions from the eastern part of Germany and
nearby regions, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of emissions data (more detail in Appendix).
Combined Simulated and Satellite observations data: The satellite-derived data have a spatial res-
olution of 1km ×1km with daily temporal frequency, while the simulated data from the previous paper
[11] have a spatial resolution of 2km ×2km and include emission rates at finer temporal frequencies.
We merged these datasets into a single dataset and redistributed it into training, validation, and test
splits based on emission levels. Figure 1b shows the comparison between the original simulated data
distribution (train_org, valid_org, test_org) and the novel combined dataset distribution (train_red,
valid_red, test_red) on train, validation and test split respectively. The significant differences in each
bin will help the model address overfitting and improve performance on unseen data. The combined
dataset’s differences in spatial and temporal resolutions are handled by both models.
Training and calibration: The loss functions used during our model training include MAE, Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Huber Loss. Prior work [11]
employed MAE and MAPE in their CNN model. In contrast, we utilized all four loss functions and
averaged the predictions from each. This comprehensive approach leverages the strengths of each
loss function, offering a more nuanced evaluation of model performance. Previous studies [11] have
suggested that segmented plumes may not significantly enhance CNN performance. Based on these
findings, we did not incorporate plume-segmented maps in our analysis. Our study utilized the same
dataset framework as prior research, with feature data consisting of XCO 2, NO 2, wind vectors (U
and V), and the emission rate as the target variable.
Preliminary Results: Table 1 summarizes the performance of the CNN and U-Net models for
three dataset scenarios: (a) simulated data, (b) satellite observations, and (c) combined data. The
best performance metrics for each scenario are highlighted in bold. The results demonstrate that
the proposed U-Net model consistently outperforms the baseline CNN model across all datasets.
3For the simulated data, the U-Net model achieves significant improvements in MAE, RMSE, and
R2compared to the CNN model. Specifically, the U-Net model achieved a 10%, 8%, and 110%
improvement over the CNN in MAE, RMSE, and R2values, respectively. When applied to satellite
observation data, the U-Net model continues to exhibit superior performance in terms of MAE
and RMSE, 1.22 and 2.47 respectively, although the R2values are lower than those obtained with
simulated data. This suggests that the complexity of real-world satellite imagery introduces additional
challenges for both models. Finally, the combined dataset, incorporating both simulated and satellite
data, leads to a substantial improvement in performance, particularly in terms of R2values. The
U-Net model achieves a 330% improvement over the original benchmark value in R2when compared
to the best result obtained with individual datasets. Both CNN and U-Net models demonstrate strong
performance on the combined dataset, but the U-Net model consistently outperforms the CNN model
across all metrics.
4 Summary and next steps
We have presented a comprehensive comparison of existing and novel data-driven approaches for
quantifying CO 2emission rates using simulated, satellite, and combined datasets. Our work includes
the development of a satellite observation-based dataset, its integration with simulated data, and
the introduction of a customized U-Net regression model specifically designed for power plant
emission rate estimation. The results demonstrate that the U-Net model significantly outperforms
the baseline CNN model [11] across all scenarios, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed
approach. While this is ongoing research, our early findings contribute to advancing data-driven
emission rate estimation. Future research directions include: (a) Geographic Expansion: Extending
the methodology to additional geographic regions. (b) Plume Quantification: Quantifying CO 2
plumes before emission rate estimation and incorporating them as additional input features. (c)
Data Fusion: Leveraging high-resolution hyper-spectral satellite data alongside coarse-resolution
atmospheric observations to enhance model performance.

5.1 Data Description
This paper utilizes simulated power plant emissions data generated by the COSMO-GHG model as part of the
SMARTCARB project to replicate CO 2and NO 2retrievals via the Copernicus CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) satellite
[11]. SMARTCARB conducted Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), which involved high-
resolution simulations of CO 2, CO, and NO 2for 2015 over Berlin and nearby power plants. These simulations
separated CO 2, CO, and NO 2into 50 tracers representing different emissions, natural fluxes, and background
concentrations, enabling the isolation of plumes from specific sources. Additionally, SMARTCARB developed
high-resolution datasets for anthropogenic emissions and biospheric CO 2fluxes, incorporating realistic temporal
and vertical variability, including power plant plume rise. A key contribution of this work is the enhancement
of the dataset beyond simulated data. Satellite observations from NASA’s OCO2/3 missions, which measure
column-averaged dry-air carbon dioxide (XCO 2) with a 16-day revisit cycle, were processed into gridded daily
data for 71 power plant locations. In addition, Sentinel-5P NO 2observations were processed and augmented to
align with the features of the simulated data. Weather data, specifically wind conditions, was obtained from
TWC. In this study, "satellite data" refers to the combination of XCO 2and NO 2satellite observations with
TWC weather data. The simulated and satellite datasets were merged to create a "combined dataset," which was
subsequently split into training and testing sets, as explained in Section 3.
5.2 Methodology
The proposed workflow illustrated in Figure 2 begins with the analysis of simulated data (case-1) and satellite
data (case-2). These datasets undergo pre-processing which includes min-max normalization to standardize the
data for subsequent analysis. The normalized outputs are considered as inputs for Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) where we have tried to uncover patterns, anomalies and correlations. In parallel, the data from Case-1
and Case-2 are merged to form a collective dataset (Case-3) which is pre-processed for EDA. Beyond EDA,
5the data from Case-1, Case-2 and Case-3 enter the augmentation submodule where techniques like rotation,
flipping and scaling are used to enhance the generalizability of the model. The augmented output serves as input
to two deep learning models that we are using in our work: (1) the baseline model, which is a conventional CNN
architecture adopted from [11] and (2) the proposed model, which is a custom U-Net network. The summary of
these models has been explained in Section 2. Further details are as follows: In traditional CNN architecture, the
process involves progressive downscaling of the image through a series of convolution and pooling to achieve
the regression value. Although this technique leads to less computation complexity, it ultimately leads to a loss
of spatial information. To overcome the problem of spatial information loss, we utilize the U-Net architecture
which addresses the limitation by integrating the skip connections with its encoder-decoder structure. The
encoder-decoder architecture can extract features at different scales which also uses its unique skip connection
layers, which connect corresponding layers from the encoder to the decoder. The skip connections concatenate
feature maps from different layers of the encoder with those from the decoder, effectively retaining spatial
information that might otherwise be lost during the down-sampling process. In this way, it ensures the retention
of spatial information enabling the model to make better predictions. This structured approach is used to utilize
diverse datasets to assess the performance of the model in different cases and demonstrate that the results obtained
by our proposed model significantly outperform the conventional CNN baseline model. This is consistent with
theory and practical expectations, as the U-Net architecture is more adept at dense prediction tasks.
