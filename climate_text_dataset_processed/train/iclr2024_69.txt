ABSTRACT
The variability of solar photovoltaic (PV) output, particularly that caused by
rapidly changing cloud dynamics, challenges the reliability of renewable energy
systems. Solar forecasting based on cloud observations collected by ground-
level sky cameras shows promising performance in anticipating short-term solar
power fluctuations. However, current deep learning methods often rely on a single
dataset with limited sample diversity for training, and thus generalize poorly to
new locations and different sky conditions. Moreover, the lack of a standardized
dataset hinders the consistent comparison of existing solar forecasting methods.
To close these gaps, we propose to build a large-scale standardized sky image
dataset — SkyImageNet — by assembling, harmonizing, and processing suitable
open-source datasets collected in various geographical locations. An accompany-
ing python package will be developed to streamline the process of utilizing Sky-
ImageNet in a machine learning framework. We hope that the outcomes of this
project will foster the development of more robust forecasting systems, advance
the comparability of short-term solar forecasting model performances, and further
facilitate the transition to the next generation of sustainable energy systems.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Integrating renewable resources, such as solar photovoltaic (PV), into the electricity grid has been
recognized as an important pathway towards a low-carbon energy system. However, large-scale
integration of PV is challenged by its fluctuating power output, mainly caused by short-term cloud
passage events (Nie et al., 2021). Current electricity systems contain a large amount of dispatchable
resources (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) that can be ramped to fill in for the variability. In contrast,
as future grids transition towards a significant share of PV , the rapid loss of power supply within
minutes would pose a substantial challenge for grid management. Anticipating such events, even
only 5 to 15 minutes in advance, would allow grid operators to efficiently adapt the response of the
grid to incoming power supply fluctuations.
Short-term solar forecasting, defined as predicting either PV power generation or solar irradiance
within a time horizon up to 30 minutes, has historically been challenging because of the complex
cloud dynamics. Images taken by ground-level sky cameras (see the right column of Figure 1)
contain abundant information of the sky and are capable of providing warning of approaching clouds
from minutes to an hour ahead (Yang et al., 2018), making it increasingly popular in short-term solar
forecasting (Paletta et al., 2023).

the Köppen–Geiger climate map. Adapted from (Nie et al., 2024). On the right, sky images taken
by a fish-eye camera under different sky conditions (a) clear sky, (b) partly cloudy, and (c) overcast.
In the recent 5 years, the use of deep learning (DL) models, such as CNNs (Sun et al., 2019; Venu-
gopal et al., 2019; Feng & Zhang, 2020; Paletta & Lasenby, 2020a; Feng et al., 2022) and RNNs
(Zhang et al., 2018; Paletta et al., 2021; 2022b) has seen a significant rise in image-based solar power
modelling. These deep learning models achieve superior performance over traditional physics-based
models (Chow et al., 2011; Marquez & Coimbra, 2013; Quesada-Ruiz et al., 2014) and machine
learning models coupled with hand-crafted feature engineering (Fu & Cheng, 2013; Chu et al.,
2013; 2015a;b; Pedro et al., 2019).
However, most existing DL-based solar forecasting models trained on datasets with limited spa-
tial and temporal coverage, struggle to generalize effectively to new locations. In addition, these
DL-based methods show poor anticipation skills under cloudy conditions, for which solar power
generation exhibits higher levels of variability, partly due to the lack of diversified cloudy samples
for model training (Paletta et al., 2021). The data limitation also hinders the further exploration of
more advanced and promising deep learning approaches for solar forecasting, such as foundation
models (Bommasani et al., 2021), which are trained on large-scale datasets and can be fine-tuned to
a range of downstream tasks or to new locations (Paletta et al., 2024) with excellent generalization
skills. Moreover, the lack of a standardized dataset hinders the consistent comparison of various
existing solar forecasting methods (Nie et al., 2022a).
2 R ELATED WORK
The increasing release of sky image datasets in recent years has provided great opportunities to ad-
dress these limitations. In a recent work by Nie et al. (2024), 72 open-source ground-based sky
image datasets collected globally for research on solar forecasting and cloud modeling have been
identified (see the left column of Figure 1). Utilizing such open-source datasets would save signif-
icant efforts in terms of in-situ data collection, which is expensive and time consuming especially
when devices need to be deployed in multiple locations for multiple years to ensure broad spatial
and temporal data coverage. Hence merging suitable open-source datasets to build one large and
diversified dataset would benefit comparable and robust model development, which is of utmost
importance in the solar forecasting community (Yang, 2019).
3 O BJECTIVES
In this project, we propose to:
1. Build a large-scale standardized ground-based sky image dataset — SkyImageNet, by as-
sembling, harmonizing and processing suitable open-source datasets collected in diverse
climate conditions. This comprehensive dataset would be valuable for short-term solar
forecasting as well as other related areas such as cloud modeling.

2. Implement and compare various existing solar forecasting methods based on the SkyIma-
geNet dataset. This would provide a comprehensive performance benchmark of the existing
methods, enabling researchers to consistently evaluate and improve their models.
3. Develop a python package with pre-implemented functions for the dataset download, data
processing, pre-trained model loading, and forecasting performance evaluation. This pack-
age would streamline the process of utilizing the SkyImageNet and accelerate the method
development of solar forecasting.
4 P ROPOSED METHODOLOGY
This study follows the common procedures for machine learning pipeline development, which cover
the following four stages: (1) data collection, (2) data processing, (3) model development and evalu-
ation, and (4) deployment. The methodology adopted for each stage are described separately below:
Data collection The datasets suitable for short-term solar forecasting would be selected from the
72 open-source sky image datasets identified in previous study (Nie et al., 2024), based on attributes
including label type (solar irradiance or PV power output), temporal resolution, and image pixel
resolution. The raw data would be collected and stored locally, while the meta information for each
dataset (e.g., the geographic locations of cameras/sensors, the camera model, the camera orientation,
the time stamps, etc.) and the processed data will be centralized and made publicly available.
Data processing The main challenge of this project is to deal with the heterogeneity of the data, as
different datasets have different data characteristics, e.g., image pixel resolution, temporal resolution
and label categories (solar irradiance or PV power output). Specifically, the various high resolution
of sky images will be down-sampled to the same lower resolution to facilitate model development.
Furthermore, to standardize images taken by cameras from sensors with different celestial orienta-
tions, a clear transformation pipeline will be developed. For different data labels, proper normaliza-
tion techniques will be proposed to handle the associated scale and unit diversity (Nie et al., 2022b;
Paletta et al., 2024). After processing, valid samples formatted as {input, output }will be formed
based on the specific setup of the solar forecasting task of inerest (e.g., forecasting horizon, sampling
interval, history length, etc.) (Paletta et al., 2023). The resulting data will then be split into model
training/validation and testing subsets, where a selection of data points representing diverse weather
conditions and locations will be isolated to constitute a fixed test set.
Model development and evaluation A typical set up for a short-term solar forecasting task is to
predict the T-minute-ahead ( T≤30) future solar irradiance or PV power output based on a sky
image sequence and possibly together withauxiliary data such as sun angles, wind speed/direction,
irradiance value and PV measurement as model input. In this project, diverse types of existing solar
forecasting models would be implemented, such as statistical (Reikard, 2009), machine learning (Fu
& Cheng, 2013; Chu et al., 2013), deep learning (Sun et al., 2019; Paletta et al., 2022b; Feng et al.,
2022), or physics-based models (Marquez & Coimbra, 2013) to construct a performance benchmark.
Following this, the training of more advanced large-scale deep learning models on the SkyImageNet,
i.e., foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), would be explored.
Deployment The resulting processed dataset will be uploaded to public repositories (e.g., Zenodo,
Mendeley data, Hugging Face) and a permanent URL will be generated to simplify its access. A
python package will be developed to include pre-implemented dataset download functions, data
pre-processing pipelines, typical image transform and augmentation functions (Paletta & Lasenby,
2020b; Julian & Sankaranarayanan, 2021; Paletta et al., 2022a; Nie et al., 2021; Terrén-Serrano
& Martínez-Ramón, 2022), pre-trained benchmark models and forecasting performance evaluation
metrics. This will enable researchers to accelerate their ML-based forecasting model development.
5 P ATHWAY TO IMPACT
The SkyImageNet project aims at advancing the development of ML-based forecasting tools to facil-
itate the integration of a large share of solar power into the energy mix. Predicting the future energy
yield of this intermittent source of energy at different time scales would indeed benefit diverse activ-
ities including energy trading, energy dispatch, frequency setting, hybrid power plant optimisation,
smart grids, and storage management (Law et al., 2016b; Carriere & Kariniotakis, 2019). For PV
systems, a recent study estimated that a solar forecasting improvement as small as 0.1% relative to
the reference model could save about 5500 tonnes of CO 2induced by gas spinning-reserves (Dixon
et al., 2022) in the UK. It was also shown that short-term forecasts contribute substantially to both

a higher economic profitability and a lower outage rate (Law et al., 2016a), thereby enabling an
increased adoption rate of this low-carbon technology around the world.
The project expects to provide easy access to multi-location multi-year sky imagery data and other
atmospheric observations, benefiting a wide community including grid operators, energy producers,
solar forecasting companies and broad academic research areas, including, for example, energy
meteorology, atmospheric and climate sciences. To ensure a long-term impact, SkyImageNet will
be well documented and will result in several publications. In addition, guidelines to contribute to
the work via new datasets, code for relevant functionalities, or model additions will be included. We
thereby build the foundation for a dataset and code base that can be used and extended by the whole
community and can result in larger versions of SkyImangeNet with more added data points from
other research groups.
