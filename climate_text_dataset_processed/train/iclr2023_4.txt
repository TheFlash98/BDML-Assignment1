ABSTRACT
Industrial air pollution has a direct health impact and is a major contributor to cli-
mate change. Small scale industries particularly bull-trench brick kilns are one of
the major causes of air pollution in South Asia often creating hazardous levels of
smog that is injurious to human health. To mitigate the climate and health impact
of the kiln industry, ﬁne-grained kiln localization at different geographic loca-
tions is needed. Kiln localization using multi-spectral remote sensing data such
as vegetation index results in a noisy estimates whereas use of high-resolution
imagery is infeasible due to cost and compute complexities. This paper proposes
a fusion of spatio-temporal multi-spectral data with high-resolution imagery for
detection of brick kilns within the “Brick-Kiln-Belt” of South Asia. We ﬁrst per-
form classiﬁcation using low-resolution spatio-temporal multi-spectral data from
Sentinel-2 imagery by combining vegetation, burn, build up and moisture indices.
Then orientation aware object detector: YOLOv3 (with value) is implemented
for removal of false detections and ﬁne-grained localization. Our proposed tech-
nique, when compared with other benchmarks, results in a 21improvement in
speed with comparable or higher accuracy when tested over multiple countries.
1 P ATH TO CLIMATE IMPACT
Industrial air pollution has a direct health impact and is a major contributor to climate change.
Unregulated small-scale informal industries spread across vast areas are common in resource-limited
settings and can be difﬁcult to locate and monitor. Remote identiﬁcation of kilns and monitoring
of their carbon production can assist air pollution surveillance, regulation, and climate mitigation
efforts. The exact numbering and location of kilns is needed to understand and address the kiln
sector’s climate and health impacts.
2 I NTRODUCTION
Vehicles and industries are considered as one of the major contributors of pollution resulting low
air quality and smog Haque et al. (2022). According to an estimate 20% of global black carbon
emission is from the brick kilns Maithel (2014). These kilns are also a major source of employment,
however according to the Global Slavery Index of 2019 , approximately 60% (24:3millions) of
the modern day slaves are within the “Brick-Kiln-Belt” of South Asia (between Afghanistan and
Nepal) Landman & Silverman (2019). Keeping in view the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal
(SDG) 3:9and8:7which speciﬁcally aims to address air pollution and forced labor respectively,
mapping brick kilns in the South Asia is an essential ﬁrst step.
Manual surveying of “Brick-Kiln-Belt” is infeasible due to the large area ( 1;551;997km2) as well
as geographic boundaries. Due to recent advancements in machine learning as well as availability

of remote sensing data, automated surveys are now more commonly used for such large scale analy-
sis Redmon & Farhadi (2018); He et al. (2017); Li et al. (2018); Xie et al. (2016); You et al. (2017);
Cotrufo et al. (2018). Recently, remote sensing images have also been used to analyze the extent of
modern slavery Boyd et al. (2018); Jackson et al. (2018); Misra et al. (2019); Foody et al. (2019).
The “Slavery from Space” project Boyd et al. (2018) proposed a crowd-sourced procedure to man-
ually detect brick kilns from satellite imagery. They randomly sampled the potential kiln areas into
320cells of 100km2each. However, they were only able to manually annotate 30geographic cells
(i.e. only 2%of the entire Brick-Kiln-Belt). As a result, the manual crowd-sourced method lacks
generalization and scalability as is evident from the resulting annotated maps that are extremely
sparse. On the other hand, low-resolution multi-spectral satellite data has also been used to classify
brick kilns in the region surrounding the Delhi state in India Misra et al. (2019). The analysis in
this work was based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and transfer learning, which
unfortunately is prone to generate a large number of false detections. In contrast, high-resolution
satellite imagery has also been used to detect brick kilns to the east of Jaipur, which is the capital
city of India’s Rajasthan state Foody et al. (2019). This work used Faster R-CNNs to automate the
process of brick kiln identiﬁcation in the given tile of images. However, owing to the large com-
putational complexity, this approach is difﬁcult to apply at a large scale. Moreover, it yields a very
high false positive rate for which they proposed to train a two-staged R-CNN classiﬁer to achieve
acceptable performance which further increased the processing time. A more recent approach called
KilnNet Nazir et al. (2020) combined inexpensive classiﬁer with object detector in a two-stage strat-
egy to address the issue of time complexity. This approach too is only based on high resolution
satellite imagery and is infeasible due to data acquisition and processing costs.
We also propose a two-stage strategy for automated detection of brick kilns, our approach is over
21faster than SOTA benchmarks and mostly relies on freely available low resolution remote sens-
ing data. Most existing object detection techniques in low resolution satellite imagery are signif-
icantly less accurate whereas computation is very costly for high resolution satellite imagery. To
overcome this our proposed methodology decouples classiﬁcation and localization. Classiﬁcation
is performed using spectral properties while localization is accomplished using orientation adapted
detector. This results in a coarse-to-ﬁne search in which ﬁne-grained orientation aware localization
via object detection is performed as a second stage only on less than 10% of the total region. This
results in a 21improvement in speed in addition to improvement in accuracy. We tested our ap-
proach on three countries (Pakistan, India and Afghanistan) and showed that it is scalable as well as
generalizable to varying structural, environmental and terrain conditions.
This paper has the following four technical contributions: (i) Fusion of spectral Indices : Classiﬁca-
tion is performed using mixture of spectral indices as shown by equation 1 in the paper. (ii) Fusion
of low resolution and high resolution imagery : Our proposed approach processes input from low-
resolution sensors for the generation of potential candidates for kilns which are then ﬁltered via
high-resolution input via Orietation-aware YOLOv3. (iii) Processing large datasets : The proposed
strategy reduces the computational burden associated with processing of large datasets by fusion
of low resolution and high resolution imagery. SOTA benchmarks take on average 674seconds to
process three datasets in Table 1 of the paper. Our proposed approach on the other hand reduces this
2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023
compute time to 38seconds only. (iv) Detection of other objects : Our multi-sensor and multi-stage
strategy can also be used to detect other objects that have differentiable spectral signatures and well
deﬁned shapes e.g. industrial units, oil tanks, warehouses, tennis courts, parking lots etc. Here we
have only demonstrated its application for geo-localization of brick kilns.
3 P ROPOSED METHODOLOGY
Brick Kilns are typically identiﬁable through a visual inspection of satellite imagery. However, while
considering a large geographic area, several inherent complexities in satellite imagery make auto-
mated detection of brick kilns a challenging task. This include, but are not limited to, i) variations in
imaging sensors, ii) differences in kilns’ structure across the countries, iii) dynamic kilns’ surround-
ings and iv) variations in luminosity, seasonal changes, and pollution levels etc. Speciﬁcally, It is
very challenging task to identify brick kilns in low resolution imagery (10meters
pixel). Existing pixel
classiﬁcation along with transfer learning approach Misra et al. (2019; 2020) for detection of brick
kilns is not scalable as well as generalizable at large scale due to cost complexities. In our proposed
multi-spectral approach brick kilns are classiﬁed using spectral indices (without transfer learning)
due to the fact that reﬂectance spectra of different land covers are different. The indices are designed
to exploit these differences to accentuate particular land cover types. The land covers are separable
at one or more wavelengths due to spectral reﬂectance of different materials (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4
in Appendix A). Brick kilns being man-made structures have a high built-up index. Unlike other
man-made structures and due to the speciﬁc nature of work, the kiln surrounding has a low vege-
tation index. Furthermore the baking process and smoke from chimneys also result in a high burn
index. Thus in this work we classify brick kilns using mixture of spectral indices namely NDVI,
EVI, NDBI, NDMI and BAI (see Appendix A). The proposed architecture is shown in Fig. 1.

3.1 K ILNCANDIDATES VIA MULTI -SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION
Based on the observation, kiln locations have low vegetation and moisture index whereas high build-
up and burn area index, small or negative values of NDVI, EVI and NDMI with positive values of
NDBI and BAI are classiﬁed as brick kilns (see Fig. 2 (i)). Thus our classiﬁcation rule is deﬁned as:
f(x; y) =(
1if NDV I < 0:2 &EV I < 0:2 &NDMI < 0 &NDBI > 0 &BAI > 5e 8
0otherwise(1)
where (x;y)is a location in latitude and longitude and function f()gives the classiﬁcation deci-
sion. We set the threshold of 0:2for NDVI and EVI as values >0:2are considered as healthy
vegetation Huete et al. (2002). In second stage we apply orientation aware detector (YOLOv3 with
value) for false removal and kilns bounding boxes.
3.2 O RIENTATION AWARE DETECTOR : YOLO V3
Although the unique spectral characteristics of brick kilns distinguish them from other classes, how-
ever they are still confused with other small industries’ chimneys as they exhibits similar spectral
properties particularly NDVI and NDBI. We eliminates the resulting false detection via object de-
tector. Unlike, urban housing, kilns in South Asia are usually build at sparse locations which is
mostly surrounding by agriculture land. Instead they are usually built at arbitrary orientations. Thus

the detection of axis aligned kilns Misra et al. (2020); Nazir et al. (2020) is not applicable and re-
sults in increased missed detections. To address this problem, bounding box with orientation can
be used Zhang et al. (2019). We then modiﬁed the YOLOv3 detector and added the neuron for re-
gressing orientation with each bounding box. We only provided ﬁltered images (potential candidates
for kilns), obtained after classiﬁcation stage, to the orientation-aware YOLOv3 model and obtained
brick kiln bounding boxes as output results.
4 Q UATITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVALUATION
For detailed experimentation of our proposed procedure, we choose evaluation dataset of three
cities named Deh Sabz, New Delhi and Kasur from three different South Asian countries namely
Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. For fair comparison we use the same geographical regions in these
cities as deﬁned in KilnNet paper Nazir et al. (2020). In addition, in order to generate training data
for our object detector, we also manually annotated bounding boxes for each one of the 1300 brick
kiln images from the ‘Asia14’ dataset Nazir et al. (2020).
We evaluated our proposed multispectral two-stage strategy with comparison to ResNet-152 He et al.
(2016) classiﬁer followed by the SOTA detector: Faster R-CNN Ren et al. (2015), SSD Liu et al.
(2016) and YOLOv3 Redmon & Farhadi (2018). A coarse-to-ﬁne strategy is proposed that aims
to ﬁlter the bulk of the data using spectral properties while the detector is only applied on a small
amount of positive detections to generate localization information while ﬁltering false positives.
It can be seen from Table 1 that the overall F1-score of our proposed strategy is comparable with
all the SOTA two-stage architectures. Simple multi-spectral approach is 54faster as compared to
other strategies but results in many false positives and less F1-score. On the other hand our proposed
approach is 21faster while retaining high F1-Score. Testing dataset images are 256256pixels for
quantitative evaluation, If the image size is larger than 256256pixels, it is detected in two image
patches. To deal with this issue, we describe the duplicates in Table 1. Our proposed architecture
also outperforms in region of Afghanistan where kiln and non-kiln regions exhibit extremely low
contrast as illustrated in our qualitative evaluation in Fig. 2 (ii) (see training parameters, Kiln-Net
vs. proposed approach and compute cost comparison in Appendix B, C & D respectively).
5 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper proposes a fusion of spatio-temporal multi-spectral data with high-resolution imagery
for detection of brick kilns within the “Brick-Kiln-Belt” of South Asia. To achieve this, we ﬁrst
perform classiﬁcation using low-resolution spatio-temporal multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2 im-
agery utilizing spectral indices. Then orientation aware object detector: modiﬁed YOLOv3 (with 
value) is implemented for removal of false detections and ﬁne-grained localization. Our proposed
technique results in a 21improvement in speed with comparable or higher accuracy when tested
over multiple countries. In future, we also aim to evaluate our proposed strategy and detection of
illegal brick kiln activity during winter smog period on all over the “Brick-Kiln-Belt” of South Asia.

APPENDIX A M ULTI -SPECTRAL INDICES
We use following ﬁve spectral indices to classify potential brick kilns on Google Earth Engine:
NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantiﬁes vegetation from remote sensing
imagery and is used in various applications such as tracking population changes Gillespie et al.
(2019) and spatial changes of a region Ranagalage et al. (2018). Near Infra-Red (NIR) and Red
bands of remote sensing images are used by the index. NDVI always ranges from -1 to 1. The
equation to ﬁnd NDVI is given in Eq. 2. Fig. 3 shows NDVI image at brick kiln locations in region
of Punjab, Pakistan and Fig. 5 shows the zoomed version at one kiln location.
NDV I =NIR  Red
NIR +Red(2)
EVI: The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is designed to minimize saturation and background
effects in NDVI Huete et al. (2002). Since it is not a normalized difference index, compute it with
this expression:
EV I =2:5(NIR  Red )
NIR + 6RED  7:5BLUE + 1(3)
NDBI: Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) is utilized to extract built-up features using
remote sensing imagery. Its other applications include tracking spatial changes of a region Rana-
galage et al. (2018) and to ﬁnd relation between urban heat islands and land cover Ogashawara &
Bastos (2012). Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) and Near Infra-Red (NIR) bands of remote sensing

images are used by the index. NDBI ranges from -1 to 1. The equation to ﬁnd NDBI is given in
Eq. 4 (see also Fig. 5).

SWIR +NIR(4)
NDMI: Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) is an index which is utilized to extricate
water bodies from satellite imagery. Green and Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands of remote
sensing images are used by the index. NDMI ranges from -1 to 1. The equation to ﬁnd NDMI is
given in Eq. 5. Fig. 5 shows NDMI image at a brick kiln location. NDMI is used to ﬁnd relation
between urban heat islands and land cover Ogashawara & Bastos (2012) as well as several other
applications.

BAI: The Burned Area Index (BAI) was developed by Chuvieco et al. (2002) to assist in the delin-
eation of burn scars and assessment of burn severity. It is based on the spectral distance to charcoal
reﬂectance. We used following expression to compute BAI.
BAI =1:0

A.1 Q UALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SPECTRAL INDICES
The kiln surrounding has a low vegetation index (EVI, NDVI), low moisture index (NDMI) and a
high built-up index (NDBI) (see Fig. 4 and Fig 5). Thus in this work we classify brick kilns using
mixture of spectral indices namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Veg-
etation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Mois-
ture Index (NDMI) and Burned Area Index (BAI).

APPENDIX B H YPERPARAMETERS FOR THE TRAINING OF
ORIENTATION -AWARE YOLO V3
Optimization method is Adam with an initial learning rate of 0:001. The learning rate increases by
0:1if validation loss does not decline for 20epochs. Instead of using ﬁxed number of epochs, we
used early stopping criteria which terminates the training process in case there is no improvement for
50consecutive epochs.Unlike Zhang et al. (2019), in our work instead of regressing out the value of 
directly, the methodology of Vanilla YOLOv3 Redmon & Farhadi (2018) was retained but instead of
using only one class for the detection of brick kilns, the following 5classes were used: Kiln- 0o, Kiln-
20o, Kiln- 40o, Kiln- 140o, and Kiln- 160owhich rotated the un-oriented bounding box (predicted by
vanilla YOLOv3) by 0,20,40,140and160degrees respectively based on their orientation. Using
quantized values of rather than regression reduces the search space and time taken in the training
and testing/prediction stages.
APPENDIX C K ILNNETNAZIR ET AL . (2020) VS. PROPOSED APPROACH
The Key differences between KilnNet Nazir et al. (2020) and our proposed approach are as follows
(see Fig. 2):
• In the prior approach Nazir et al. (2020), high resolution DigitalGlobe imagery is used.
Although use of high-resolution imagery improves the accuracy, as mentioned in Fig. 10
of Nazir et al. (2020), it requires 93 days to process the entire brick kiln belt ( 1551997km2)
of South Asia. In this work we addressed this concern and proposed an improved approach
that results in a 21improvement in speed with comparable or higher accuracy when tested
over multiple countries. We achieved this by a strategy that uses low-resolution multi-
spectral imagery as well as high-resolution imagery. The low-resolution multi-spectral
pre-ﬁlter bulk of data without introducing missed detections. Thus the detailed analysis is
only applied on a very small chunk of high-resolution imagery.
• In the prior methodology, two-stage gated neural network architecture consisting of a
ResNet-152 classiﬁer and a YOLOv3 detector is proposed. Our proposed coarse-to-ﬁne
strategy is also a two-staged approach with two major differences. In the ﬁrst stage we
replace CNN based classiﬁcation on high-resolution ( 0:149meter
pixel) data with fusion of low-
resolution ( 10meter
pixel) spectral indices to pre-ﬁlter bulk of the date followed by orientation-
aware YOLOv3 detector on the ﬁltered data. Furthermore, in this work we proposed a
modiﬁed object detector that along with bounding boxes also produces the orientation in-
formation.
• In the previous methodology, classiﬁer is selected by considering the class imbalance issues
using F-Beta measure. In the proposed approach we select a classiﬁer based on the obser-
vation that kiln locations have low vegetation and moisture index whereas high build-up
and burn area index.
• The prior methodology takes 674seconds to process three datasets in Table 1 of the paper.
As a result of the above mentioned differences the proposed approach on the other hand
reduces this compute time to 38seconds only.

In nutshell, our coarse-to-ﬁne strategy aims to ﬁlter the bulk of the data using spectral properties on
Google Earth Engine while the detector is only applied on small amount of positive detections as
to generate localization information while ﬁltering false positives on Google Colab (Tesla T4). We
evaluated our trained network on unseen dataset consisting of Kasur (Pakistan), New Delhi (India)
and Deh Sabz (Afghanistan) for quantitative analysis. (see Table 1. If the brick kiln is larger than
256 x 256 it is detected in two image patches. To deal with this issue we describes the duplicates in
Table 1.
APPENDIX D C OMPUTE COST COMPARISON WITH STATE -OF-THE-ART
The detection of brick kilns by analyzing the spectral properties on Google Earth Engine takes
approximately 3,4and 8seconds to process Kasur (Pakistan), New Delhi (India) and Deh Sabz
(Afghanistan), respectively. Then the orientation aware detector: YOLOv3 is ran on potential brick
kiln locations including false positives on Google Colab Tesla T4 GPU. Each experiment is repeated
5 times to ﬁnd the the average time on Google Colab which is 4.04, 4.16 and 15.1 to localize
potential kilns in Kasur (Pakistan), New Delhi (India) and Deh Sabz (Afghanistan), respectively
(see Table 1).
