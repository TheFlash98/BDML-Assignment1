Abstract
Glacier retreat is a key indicator of climate change and requires regular
updates of the glacier area. Recently, the release of a new inventory for the
European Alps showed that glaciers continued to retreat at about 1.3% a−1
from 2003 to 2015 . The outlines were produced by manually correcting the
results of a semi-automatic method applied to Sentinel-2 imagery. In this work
we develop a fully-automatic pipeline based on Deep Learning to investigate
the evolution of the glaciers in the Alps from 2015 to present (2023). After
outlier filtering, we provide individual estimates for around 1300 glaciers,
representing 87% of the glacierized area. Regionally we estimate an area loss
of-1.8% a−1, with large variations between glaciers. Code and data are available

1 Introduction
Glaciers are critical components in the Earth system, and an essential water resource for both industrial
and domestic use[1]. They act as a low-pass filter for high-frequency, inter-annual variability in
weather, which makes them a valuable and sensitive climate change indicator on multi-annual
timescales [2]. One of the observations for assessing glacier health is their area[3], which has been
classified as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) [4]. Glaciers in the European Alps experienced a
large volume loss over the last two decades[5] and, as a consequence, they also retreated significantly
(about -1.3% change in area per year), as shown by Paul et al. [6] in the latest inventory available for
this region.
There are more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide and methods requiring manual intervention are,
therefore, extremely labour intensive[3]. Fully automated methods are, however, challenging for
many reasons, e.g. cast shadow, local clouds, difficulties in distinguishing debris-covered segments
from surrounding rocks or seasonal/perennial snow from glacier ice etc. [7]. As a consequence,
significant variations can occur even within outlines manually delineated by experts[6].
Recently, there has been significant progress in developing fully-automated methods for glacier
mapping, mainly based on Deep Learning approaches. Xie et al. [8] provides a comparison of
multiple architectures, with DeepLabV3+[9] and GlacierNet[10] (an extended U-Net[11] architecture)
achieving the best (IOU) scores. Baraka et al. [12] use also U-Net for the Hindu Kush Himalayan
region and inicluded a web tool that can be used for visualizing and correcting the predictions.
Here, we utilize a Deep Learning method with additional data processing steps in order to investigate
the evolution of the glaciers in the Alps between 2015 and the present (2023). For this we train a
segmentation model using the existing (manually corrected) inventory outlines. When evaluating
the model on unseen data we find good agreement between the estimated areas and the inventory
ones. Next, we develop a pipeline which automatically downloads Sentinel-2 data by minimizing the
cloud coverage for each glacier separately. Finally, we apply the model on data from 2023 and then

training and evaluating glacier mapping models, together with the code to (re)train the models are
freely available at https://github.com/dcodrut/glacier_mapping_alps_tccml .
2 Data
Inventory data . The first step is to collect the images which were employed to build the inventory
[6], using exactly the same dates, to ensure that the outlines and the images correspond perfectly. The
inventory contains 4395 glaciers with a total area of ca. 1806 km2and it was built using Sentinel-2
images mainly from 2015 (with some from 2016 and 2017). The previous inventory ( i.e. RGI v6
[13], from 2003) contains 3927 glaciers with a total area of ca. 2092 km2. When comparing them, a
regional-level shrinkage can be estimated, i.e. -14% (-1.2% a−1). However, a more realistic estimate
is -1.3% a−1when taking into account that the new inventory contains glaciers which were previously
missing. Moreover, this is still considered a lower bound due to the inclusion of seasonal and
perennial snow in a few sub-regions [6].
Given that the resolution of Sentinel-2 data is 10m, we decided to use only the glaciers with an area
larger than 0.1 km2. Although this reduces the number of glaciers sampled (1646, i.e. about 37%), the
percentage of glacierized area covered is close to 95%. To facilitate further analyses, we additionally
drop 13 small glaciers (average area = 0.16 km2) which are not represented in the previous inventory
from 2003. This results in 1633 glaciers, covering 94.36% of the current inventory area, which will
be used to train and validate our model.
Present data (2023). In order to maximize the observation period and thus increasing the
signal-to-noise ratio, we utilise, where possible, the most recent data, i.e. end of summer 2023.
According to the most recent measurements from the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (GLAMOS),
2023 was a strong melt year [14]. This, in turn, reduces the occurrence of spurious late-season snow
cover, thus offering better conditions for glacier mapping.
A common criterion used to download optical data is by choosing the tile (i.e. 100km x 100km for
Sentinel-2) with the smallest percentage of cloud coverage for each region of interest. If we follow
this strategy and then compute the average cloud coverage per glacier (using the inventory outlines),
we obtain an average of 4%. However, if rather than restricting to one single tile we instead use the
least cloudy five tiles (centered on 01.09.2023 ±15 days) and then choose the best for each glacier
individually, we significantly reduce the cloud coverage to 0.1%. This is lower than the average in
the inventory images i.e. 2.7%.
3 Methodology
Model architecture. To segment the glaciers, we use the U-Net architecture [11], with a ResNet34
backbone[15], and the implementation from [16]. This architecture was found to be one of the best
performing in [8], with a relatively smaller model size compared to the other methods evaluated. We
extend the input from three to six channels, to accommodate the following inputs:
•five Sentinel-2 bands: blue (B2), green (B3), red (B4), NIR (B8) and SWIR (B12), which
we found the most informative;
•surface elevation, obtained from NASADEM[17] (30m resolution) and processed using
the Open Global Glacier Model[18]. The surface elevation should help for debris-cover on
glaciers [10], Central Europe being one of the regions with the highest percentage of debris
cover[19].
Model training. We train the model to predict the probability that each pixel is glacier or not, using
patches of 256x256 pixels ( i.e. 2.56x2.56 km). Given that we apply the model only on glacierized
regions, we sample patches only if the center is on the glacier, which also helps in balancing the two
classes. This implies that the model sees only the glaciers and a maximum buffer of 1.28km around,
which also helps in reducing the data volume. We train the model with PyTorch [20] and PyTorch
Lighting[21], with a binary cross entropy loss. The pixels which are either missing or covered by
clouds/shadows are excluded when computing the loss. The bands are individually normalized using
the mean and standard deviation of the training samples.

(47.1◦N, 12.3◦E), with an inventory area of 4.03 km2in 2016. We apply the model in 2016, where
some miss-classified sections can be observed, and then in 2023, where the model again misses
those segments (they are debris-covered and seem to become completely disconnected from the main
glacier body). The error being systematic, it will not affect significantly the area change estimate. For
this glacier we obtain an area loss of -1.66% a−1.

Model evaluation. We use a five-fold cross-validation (CV) scheme to evaluate the model. The split
is done geographically, from West to East, to ensure that the testing scores capture the generalization
ability of the model. Another important reason is that, ultimately, we want one prediction for each
glacier. With this scheme, depicted in Figure A1, we train five models and then collect only the
inferences from the testing areas, thus covering the entire region.
Area (change) estimation . Given the significant volume loss observed over the 2000-2019 period[5],
with a mean elevation change of -1.02 ±0.21 m a−1, we can assume that glaciers in this region do
not grow over the 2015-2023 period. This allows us to extract the changes in the areas by applying
the model for each glacier but only for the pixels within the inventory outlines, thus excluding the
predictions outside these. However, we do not use the areas from the inventory as the reference value
but the predicted ones such that, if the model makes systematic errors, they will cancel out, as in
the case illustrated in Figure 1. Therefore, for each glacier, we calculate the area change per year as
(Ap
2023−Ap
y)/(2023−y)where Apdenotes the predicted area and ydenotes the inventory year, so
y∈ {2015,2016,2017}. If we then divide this annual rate by Ap
y, we can express the area change
rate in percentages per year. In order to decrease the noise in our estimates, we proceed with some
filtering steps, which are detailed in the Appendix A. This leaves 1285 glaciers, which is only 29%
from the inventory total, but covering 1572 km2, a significant fraction of the glacierized area (87%).
4 Results
We first report the standard performance metrics based on patches that fall into the testing region of
each split. The results (Table 1) are comparable to those from previous studies on the Himalayan
region[8], which also experiences significant debris cover[19]. We also observe that the scores vary
from one sub-region to other, the best being obtained for the regions with a smaller number of larger
glaciers (given that the data split ensures a similar total glacierized area in each sub-region).

size class (km2)area change rate (%)Figure 2: Distribution of per-glacier area change rates, separated by their size class (same ones as in
[6]). The highest possible rate is -12.5% which would imply that the glacier completely melted over
the last eight years. The text shows the number of glaciers in each class (n) and the sum of their areas
relative to the total glacierized area covered (A %).
The relatively high recall shows that the models manage to recover a significant part of the glacier,
therefore next we will focus on the predictions at glacier level. We estimate the areas as previously
described and compare them to the inventory values from ∼2015, with which we find a very good
agreement (details provided in Figure A3). Given that we only limit the predictions to the given
inventory, our predictions are always an underestimate but with a relatively small bias, only -0.07 km2.
The filtering steps remove the outliers and thus reduce the bias to -0.06 km2. Moreover, if we assume
that a significant part of the bias is due to systematic errors ( e.g. consistently missed debris-covered
segments, as the one exemplified in Figure 1, or segments always shaded) we expect the area changes
not to be significantly affected by errors in the model.
We show the distribution of the area change rates of all the glaciers separated by their size class in
Figure 2. First, we observe that most of the glaciers, especially the small ones, have a significant
negative change rate, which is in line with the negative volume changes estimated over the last two
decades [5]. Second, we notice many small glaciers are losing a significant fraction of their surface
area over the last eight years, some being close to complete deglaciation ( i.e. disappearing over that
time period). Finally, we observe a higher variability among the small glaciers, as they can have
diverse topographical and morphological settings which influences their sensitivity to climate change
processes[22], but it may also be due to a lower signal-to-noise ratio. To obtain a regional level
estimate, we integrate over the total estimated areas, obtaining 1504 km2and 1289 km2in 2015 and
2023, respectively, resulting in a -1.8% a−1area loss.
5 Conclusions
We develop a fully-automatic pipeline to train a glacier mapping model for the European Alps using
the most recent inventory and apply it on data from 2023. The predicted glacier masks are then used
to estimate the areas and, after post-processing, provide estimates, both at glacier and regional level,
for area changes from 2015-2023. Our regional estimate is -1.8% a−1, which illustrates the high
sensitivity of the glaciers in this region to climate change, with significant inter-glacier variability.
Our detailed glacier-scale estimates could provide valuable constraints on future water availability
and discharge for hydro-power production and other water-critical activities, which heavily rely on
glacier-driven melt water [23].

Filtering steps
First, the aim is to drop the results for which the model does not perform well according to the testing
results. This can be due to e.g. very high percentage of debris coverage, a significant part covered
by topographical shadows or presence of clouds which were not masked correctly. Thus we keep
only the glaciers which have a recall larger than 75%, as shown in Figure A2. Second, we drop the
glaciers for which either of the start or end years has more than 20% masked-out pixels. For the
glaciers where there are still some masked-out pixels, we apply a correction to the estimated area: we
assume a recall equal to the one obtained on the non-masked pixels, such that the values from the two
years are comparable. Finally, once we compute the rates as described in Section 3, we drop the most
extreme 5% of the values.
