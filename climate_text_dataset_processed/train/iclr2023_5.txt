ABSTRACT
Flooding is one of the most destructive and costly natural disasters, and climate
changes would further increase risks globally. This work presents a novel mul-
timodal machine learning approach for multi-year global Ô¨Çood risk prediction,
combining geographical information and historical natural disaster dataset. Our
multimodal framework employs state-of-the-art processing techniques to extract
embeddings from each data modality, including text-based geographical data and
tabular-based time-series data. Experiments demonstrate that a multimodal ap-
proach, that is combining text and statistical data, outperforms a single-modality
approach. Our most advanced architecture, employing embeddings extracted us-
ing transfer learning upon DistilBert model, achieves 75%-77% ROCAUC score
in predicting the next 1-5 year Ô¨Çooding event in historically Ô¨Çooded locations.
This work demonstrates the potentials of using machine learning for long-term
planning in natural disaster management.
1 I NTRODUCTION
A disastrous Ô¨Çood in 2022 left one third of the land in Pakistan underwater for over four months,
affecting 33 million people in the country and causing over 30 billion US dollars of damage (United
Nations). Globally, Ô¨Çoods cost billions of dollars each year and inÔ¨Çict massive damage to human
life, infrastructure, agriculture, and industrial activities. Most concerningly, studies suggest climate
change impacts lead to drastically increasing Ô¨Çooding risks globally in both frequency and scale
(Wing et al., 2022; Hirabayashi et al., 2013). Therefore, it is crucial to develop both short-term and
long-term predictions for Ô¨Çood events to mitigate damage.
Most established models for Ô¨Çood prediction use physical models to simulate hydrological dynam-
ics. Kauffeldt et al. (2016) provides a technical review of large-scale hydrodynamical models em-
ployed in various continents. The most advanced models take into consideration terrain data, wa-
ter Ô¨Çow data, river networks (Sampson et al., 2015). To combine insights from individual models
and reduce errors, most forecasting agencies, such as the pan-European Flood Awareness System
(EFAS), employ an ensemble of predictions across many individual hydrological models to produce
probabilistic forecasts (Thielen et al., 2009).
Physical models dominate short-term Ô¨Çood prediction space; however, they lack forecasting capabil-
ities for a longer horizon due to escalating simulation errors. To address this need, machine learning
can emerge as a powerful tool to offer a predictive perspective. Mosavi et al. (2018) provides an
extensive literature review on the recent ML approaches. Most early works of machine learning
approaches are based on a single modality of data, such as rainfall and water level data (Sajedi-
Hosseini et al., 2018; Choubin et al., 2018; ElsaÔ¨Å, 2014), or remote-sensing dataset such as satellite
and radars to capture real-time high resolution rain gauges (Kim & Barros, 2001; Sampson et al.,
2015). Multimodal machine learning, referring to models that employ more than one modality of
data such as tabular, imagery, text, or other formats, have been recently applied for Ô¨Çood detection
purposes. For instance, de Bruijn et al. (2020) combines hydrological information with twitter data
to detect and monitor Ô¨Çood.
This work presents a multimodal machine learning approach combining for global multi-year Ô¨Çood
prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst machine learning Ô¨Çood prediction model at

the global scale and on a multi-year horizon. In addition, it is the Ô¨Årst time text-based data has been
applied to Ô¨Çood prediction. Our main contributions are three-fold:
1. A novel multimodal framework to incorporate text-based geographical information to com-
plement time-series statistical features for global Ô¨Çood prediction. We employ state-of-the
art large natural language processing techniques, including Ô¨Åne-tuning and transfer learning
on pre-trained BERT models.
2. Our experiments show strong results for multi-year Ô¨Çood risk forecasting, with the strongest
model achieving 75%-77% ROCAUC score in the next 1-5 year Ô¨Çooding prediction. In
addition, we show that multimodal models, combining text with statistical data, outperform
single-modal models using only statistical data.
3. Our framework can be generalised to other natural disaster forecasting tasks such as the
wildÔ¨Åres, earthquakes, droughts, and extreme weather events. Thus, this works suggests a
promising direction in long-term preparation for natural disaster management.

Historical Flood Data. We use the Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) dataset, which includes geocoded
information on 9,924 unique natural disasters occurred globally between 1960 and 2018 (Rosvold
& Buhaug, 2021). In addition, we linked this dataset with the EM-DAT dataset to add additional
economic information such as damage estimation (emd, 2021). In this project, we restrict forecasting
locations to those with historical Ô¨Çooding event. We use the date, latitude, longitude, location (given
as the name of the location), and if available, damage cost from this dataset. We divide the earth into
1by 1grid, corresponding to about 100km by 100km squares. Using the latitude and longitude
information, we compute a ‚Äògrid id‚Äô for each natural disaster from the GDIS dataset. Overall, there
are 2852 unique grid locations in the dataset with a recorded historical natural disaster.
Geographical Data. To incorporate the geographical information of each location, we use open-
source Wikipedia website‚Äôs Geographical section, which contain text-based geographical description
of certain areas, as shown in Figure 1 as an example for the ‚ÄòBoston‚Äô Wikipedia page. To obtain the
geographical information, we use the ‚Äòlocation‚Äô data from the GDIS dataset for each grid id, then
use the Wikipedia-API to obtain the text from the Geographical section for each location (wik). To
deal with the noise in the data, since some locations have different names on Wikipedia, we search
over synonyms for each location. For those location Wikipedia pages without Geography section,
we use the Summary section. Among 2852 unique grid ids, we collected text-based information for
2775 grid ids, and Ô¨Åll the remainder grid ids as ‚Äòmissing‚Äô.

3 M ETHODOLOGY
The overall goal is to predict next 1 to 5 years of Ô¨Çood risk using a multimodal approach. The
framework adopts a three-step approach to combine distinct data formats and sources. Figure 2
illustrates the overall three-step framework. More details of the training and testing protocol can be
found in the Appendix.
1. We gather different sources and modalities of data, which are a) tabular-based historical
natural disaster data and b) text-based geographical data from Wikipedia pages.

2. We perform feature processing individually for each data modality, and obtain a one-
dimensional feature representation (embeddings) respectively.
3. We concatenate feature embeddings from different modalities and perform feature sections,
before making next-N-year Ô¨Çood event predictions using gradient boosted tree (XGBoost)
models for binary classiÔ¨Åcation task. Prediction target 1 indicates a Ô¨Çood in the next N
years, 0 otherwise.

Figure 2: Three-step framework to combine statistical data with text-based data. The transformer-
based text data embedding extraction contains three types of architectures.
3.1 S TATISTICAL FEATURE PROCESSING
We use the GDIS dataset to process historical statistics of natural disasters. In particular, for each
grid id, we aggregate statistical features into yearly basis uisng only the current year‚Äôs natural dis-
aster statistics. In particular, we summarize the ‚Äòcount‚Äô ‚Äòbinary‚Äô and ‚Äòdamage cost‚Äô feature during
the year for each natural disaster: ‚ÄòÔ¨Çood‚Äô, ‚Äòstorm‚Äô, ‚Äòearthquake‚Äô, ‚Äòextreme temperature‚Äô, ‚Äòlandslide‚Äô,
‚Äòvolcanic activity‚Äô, ‚Äòdrought‚Äô, ‚Äòmass movement (dry)‚Äô. The ‚Äòdamage cost‚Äô feature corresponds to the
insurance amount claimed by the natural disaster, which is intended as a proxy to reÔ¨Çect the severity
of the natural disaster. In total, the statistical features contain 24 features. Additionally, we record
the ‚Äòyear‚Äô feature as numerical feature.
3.2 T EXT FEATURE PROCESSING
For each location, we use the Geography section from the Wikipedia page using the location name.
This information is given as text, and each location is associated with a paragraph of geographi-
cal information description. Under the scope of this work, we experiment with pre-trained large
language model DistilBert, a distilled version of the BERT model, which offers good performance
whilst faster to train and Ô¨Åne-tune (Sanh et al., 2019). The two main challenges are: a) DistilBert
model is trained on a large set of generic texts, whilst we would like to adapt it to encode geographi-
cal information speciÔ¨Åcally; b) feature extraction is performed on a token-by-token basis, whilst we
require embeddings corresponding to a paragraph of sentences. In summary, we experiment with
three distinct architectures.
1. The original DistilBert. As proposed by Li et al. (2020), we use the second last layer of
hidden states and taking the average of embedding tokens across from all words in the
sentence to obtain the paragraph embedding.
2. Fine-tuned version of the DistilBert model. We Ô¨Åne-tune the DistilBertForSequenceClas-
siÔ¨Åcation model using binary classiÔ¨Åcation labels with 1 indicating the location has more
than two historical Ô¨Çoods, and 0 indicating the location has less or equal to two historical
Ô¨Çoods. The motivation is to Ô¨Åne-tune DistilBert embeddings speciÔ¨Åcally for Ô¨Çood predic-
tion. Then we pool token embeddings by taking the average of the second last layer.
3. Transfer learning and dimensionality reduction. We add an additional linear layer of di-
mension (796, 32) with a sigmoid activation function. The classiÔ¨Åcation labels are the
same as in the second approach, and we use the 32 vector as extracted embeddings. During
3Published as a workshop paper at ‚ÄùTackling Climate Change with Machine Learning‚Äù, ICLR 2023
the training process, parameters from the pre-trained model are frozen, and the training
only learns parameters from the linear layer. Similarly as above, we compute paragraph
embeddings by taking the average of the 32-vector embeddings for each token.
4 R ESULTS
Table 4 contains out-of-sample binary classiÔ¨Åcation performance from various models for the next
1,2,5 year Ô¨Çood prediction horizon on the selected 818 grid locations. In summary, a multimodal
approach demonstrates the strongest performance, achieving 70% - 75% ROCAUC score. Training
and testing sets are randomly selected at 70% and 30%, and more details on the training protocols
can be found in the Appendix.
We construct a deterministic baseline model which predicts the next N years of Ô¨Çood outcome as
the same current year Ô¨Çood outcome. This approach aims to mark previously Ô¨Çooded region as high
risk, which is similar to the Ô¨Çood risk mapping procedure employed by agencies such as FEMA.
Due to high class imbalance, metrics such as ROCAUC and balanced accuracy scores are more ob-
jective than accuracy scores in evaluating prediction capabilities. We observe that a single-modality
model employing only statistical features outperforms the baseline model by around 35% in RO-
CAUC score and around 25% in balanced accuracy, underperforms the baseline by around 23%
in accuracy score. Among multimodal approaches, the strongest architecture combines statistical
features with text features obtained using transfer learning upon DistilBert model. This architecture
improves upon the baseline model by around 42% in ROCAUC score, 25% in balanced accuracy,and
underperforms the baseline by around 13% in accuracy score. Finally, other multimodal architec-
tures, such as using directly pre-trained DistilBert or Ô¨Ånetuned DistilBert does not improve the
performance from a single-modality approach.

A T RAINING AND TESTING PROTOCOL
In Step II, for the Ô¨Åne-tuning and transfer learning of transformer-based feature extraction models,
we split the text dataset (which contains 2852 locations with associated Wikipedia text data) into
training and validation set with 70% randomly selected samples as the training set. Models are
trained using SGD with Adam optimiser. Both Ô¨Åne-tuning and transfer learning are trained on 3
epochs.
In Step III, for the training and testing of the downstream binary classiÔ¨Åcation task of Ô¨Çooding
risk, we separate the data into 70% training and 30% testing. For each model, we perform 3-fold
cross validation on the grid search to perform hyperparameter tuning with AUC score as the scoring
metric. we record the following evaluation merics: accuracy, balanced accuracy, ROCAUC score,
and F1 score.
The training and Ô¨Åne-tuning of DistilBert models are conducted on Google Colab with 1 GPU com-
puting power. The training and parameter search on classiÔ¨Åcation tasks are conducted using the MIT
SuperCloud cluster with 1 GPU computing power (Reuther et al., 2018).
As a remark, due to the rarity of natural disaster occurrence, we face a signiÔ¨Åcant data imbalance
challenge: the majority of the grids would not have a Ô¨Çood incidence and, thus, the positive pre-
diction case is less than 0.1% for the entire dataset. To address this issue, we Ô¨Ålter to select grid
ids with at least 2 historical Ô¨Çood incidents, and perform prediction tasks on those selected grid ids.
This Ô¨Åltering criterion is based on the assumption that some grid locations are not prone to Ô¨Çooding
risk. Among 2852 unique grids, 881 grids are selected.
