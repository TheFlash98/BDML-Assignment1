ABSTRACT
With the escalating urgency of climate change, it is becoming more imperative
for businesses and organizations to align their objectives with sustainability goals.
Financial institutions also face a critical mandate to fulfill the Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals (SDGs), particularly goal 13, which targets the fight against climate
change and its consequences. Mitigating the impacts of climate change requires
a focus on reducing supply chain emissions, which constitute over 90% of total
emission inventories. In the financial industry, supply chain emissions linked to
lending and investments emerge as the primary source of emissions, posing chal-
lenges in tracking financed emissions due to the intricate process of collecting data
from numerous suppliers across the supply chain.
To address these challenges, we propose an emission estimation framework uti-
lizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to drastically accelerate the assessment of
the emissions associated with lending and investment activities. This framework
utilizes financial activities as a proxy for measuring financed emissions. Utiliz-
ing the LLM, we classify financial activities into seven asset classes following the
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) standard. Additionally, we
map investments to industry categories and employ spend-based emission factors
(kg-CO2/$-spend) to calculate emissions associated with financial investments. In
our study, we compare the performance of our proposed method with state-of-the-
art text classification models like TF-IDF, word2Vec, and Zero-shot learning. The
results demonstrate that the LLM-based approach not only surpasses traditional
text mining techniques and performs on par with a subject matter expert (SME)
but most importantly accelerates the assessment process.
1 I NTRODUCTION
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outline a path towards a more sustain-
able future, comprising 17 goals and 169 targets agreed unanimously by all UN member countries in
2015. SDG 13 focuses on addressing climate change, advocating for the integration of climate mea-
sures into national policies, strategies, and plans Nations (2023). Despite these efforts, it has been
challenging to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5◦C above pre-
industrial levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Projections suggest a potential surpass-
ing of the critical 1.5◦C threshold by 2035 unless significant actions are undertaken Nations (2023).
The financial sector, a key player in the global economy, holds substantial influence over resource
allocation. Financial institutions, through investments and lending, can significantly impact carbon
emissions. Directing capital toward decarbonization aligns with a 1.5°C scenario, and institutions
can actively mitigate their climate impact by disclosing the carbon footprint of their portfolios.
The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard Protocol et al. (2004) provides a systematic framework for
quantifying an enterprise’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, categorizing them into three scopes.
Scope 1 (S1) pertains to direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, while Scope 2 (S2)
involves indirect emissions from purchased energy generation. Scope 3 (S3) encompasses all in-
direct emissions within the reporting company’s value chain, including upstream and downstream
emissions. The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard
Protocol (2011) further categorizes scope 3 emissions into 15 categories, with Scope 3 Category 15

(investments) addressing emissions from a reporting company’s loans and investments, often a sub-
stantial part of financial institutions GHG emissions inventory. The Partnership for Carbon Account-
ing Financials (PCAF) has developed the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the
Financial Industry PCAF (2022), facilitating standardized measurement and reporting of financed
emissions. This process is essential for adhering to disclosure regulations, providing transparency
to investors, establishing net-zero goals, and navigating transition risks. However, the presence of
limited data, along with other challenges outlined in Appendix A.2, poses a significant hurdle.
Foundation models, a recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence, involve large-scale self-
supervised learning on very large datasets. Their adaptability allows for superior fine-tuning in
various tasks, often surpassing the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning
models. This success has driven researchers to investigate how such foundation models, specifically
applied to applications in climate and sustainability can be developed and deployed. For instance,
Nugent et al. (2021) utilized a domain-specific language model pre-trained on business and financial
news data to identify Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics. Similarly, Luccioni et al.
(2020) employed a custom transformer-based NLP model to extract climate-relevant information
from financial documents. Additionally, Corringham et al. (2021) investigated the use of pre-trained
transformers to classify sentences in a dataset of climate action plans submitted to the United Na-
tions after the 2015 Paris Agreement. To encourage the development of foundation models for Earth
monitoring, Lacoste et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark comprising various downstream tasks re-
lated to climate change. Furthermore, Balaji et al. (2023) suggested estimating the carbon footprint
of household products using zero-shot semantic text similarity. However, the application of foun-
dation models in estimating supply chain emissions in the financial industry remains unexplored.
Further investigation is needed to understand their potential contribution to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and achieving sustainable development goals, particularly in the financial sector.
In this paper, we propose a LLM based financed emission estimation framework by utilizing finan-
cial investment as a proxy for financed emissions. We leveraged LLM to accelerate the classification
of the financial disclosures to 7 asset classes, further mapped the investment to 66 industry classes
and leveraged industry average spend based emission factors (kg CO 2/$) to calculate emission as-
sociated with the financial investments. We compared the performance of the proposed method with
the state-of-art text classification models such as TF-IDF, word2Vec, and Zero shot learning.
2 M ETHODOLOGY
We introduce an novel framework A.3 for estimating Scope 3 emissions in the financial industry by
leveraging large language models (LLM). The framework comprises four modules: data prepara-
tion, fine-tuning of LLM, classification, and emission computation. In the data preparation module,
we thoughtfully created approximately 2600 examples of financial investment expenses for seven
asset classes following PCAF guidance (see appendix A.1) and 21000 samples for 66 industry sec-
tor classes based on the US EEIO standard (refer to appendix A.4). These samples ensure adequate
representation from each subclass. In the subsequent module, we selected pre-trained foundation
models (BERT and RoBERTa) and fine-tuned them using labeled samples with a 70:20:10 train-
validation-test split. After adapting the model, we assessed its performance with test samples, iden-
tifying classes with low performance for further fine-tuning with additional training samples. Once
fine-tuning is complete, the fine-tuned foundation models are employed for inferring both asset and
industry classes in unknown financial investment description data. In the last module, the financed
emissions of a loan or investment in a company are computed by multiplying the attribution factor
with the emissions of the respective borrower or investee company. The attribution factor is derived
from the proportional share of investment in an investee company. The emission of the investee com-
pany is calculated by multiplying its revenue in each industry class with the spend-based emission
factor (CO 2/$) Ingwersen & Li (2022) of that industry class . For each asset class, emissions are
computed according to the PCAF standard (see A.1).
3 E XPERIMENTATION
We explore different training strategies, including our proposed approach, to assess and compare
their performance on the given problem.

3.1 U SING ZERO-SHOT CLASSIFICATION
We conducted zero-shot learning using semantic text similarity, following the approach proposed
in Balaji et al. (2023), to evaluate if financial investment ledger data classification could be per-
formed without using domain-specific training data. This method utilizes pre-trained language mod-
els and sentence transformers, designed to encode textual information into fixed-length vector rep-
resentations. Different open-source sentence-transformer models, such as all-mpnet-base-v2 ,
all-MiniLM-L12-v2 , and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 , were experimented with. Cosine similarity
between embeddings of input financial ledger text and asset or industry sector classes served as the
measure of semantic similarity in all experimental settings.
3.2 S UPERVISED LEARNING USING CLASSICAL MODELS
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) signifies term importance within a docu-
ment based on its frequency in that document (TF) and scarcity across the entire dataset (IDF). We
extracted features and computed TF-IDF values for each term in the training dataset. Subsequently,
we vectorized input transaction text into numeric feature vectors based on TF-IDF values, utilizing
these vectors to train our machine learning classifier model.
Word2Vec, introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013), is an widely adopted algorithm for generating word
embeddings. We utilized Word2Vec to craft feature representations for financial transaction descrip-
tion data by calculating the mean of word embeddings for all words in a specific transaction text. We
trained classical ML models, including random forest classifier, SVM classifier, and MLP classifier,
for both TF-IDF and Word2Vec-based feature vectors representation.
3.3 S UPERVISED FINE -TUNING
We conducted extensive experiments involving the refinement of encoder-based Large Language
Models (LLMs) to classify transaction data into distinct commodity categories. Pre-trained models,
such as bert-base-uncased androberta-base , available on the Huggingface library, were
fine-tuned. These models are pre-trained using masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence
prediction (NSP) objectives, capturing contextual nuances and bidirectional relationships between
words. Adjustments in sequence length parameters and learning rates were explored, and model
evaluation relied on the checkpoint with the lowest validation loss.
4 R ESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
4.1 E VALUATION METHOD
We evaluate the outlined approaches using test data consisting of 2610 samples of financial invest-
ment transaction texts. The metric employed for comparison is the weighted F1 score.
Performance of zero-shot method Table 1 displays the results from zero-shot approaches. No-
tably, F1 scores range from 64-71% for asset class classification and 20-22% for industry class
classification. This aligns with expectations, given the fewer (7) asset classes compared to the nu-
merous (66) industry classes. Among the sentence transformers, all-MiniLM-L12-v2 outper-
forms others, consistent with documentation details. Overall, the text similarity approach exhibits
low performance, underscoring the importance of a supervised approach.

Performance of Supervised Learning using classical models Table 2 evaluates classical models
with TF-IDF and Word2Vec vectorization using a random forest classifier. Both methods perform
similarly for asset classification, but Word2Vec outperforms TF-IDF in the 66 industry sector clas-
sification. This is attributed to Word2Vec’s ability to capture semantic relationships and provide
contextual insights, surpassing TF-IDF’s limitations.
Performance of Supervised Fine Tuning Table 3 presents the performance of roberta-base
andbert-base-uncased for different max length settings. The models performance remains
unaffected by varying max length , indicating the negligible impact on model performance. Reduced
learning rates during fine-tuning result in more gradual convergence and improved validation loss as
shown in table 4. This approach outperforms traditional machine learning models, showcasing the
efficacy of pre-training LLMs on extensive text corpora.

4.2 A BLATION STUDY
Subset of training data Using 50% of the training and validation data in supervised learning
(sections 3.2 and 3.3) leads to reduced F1 scores (Table 5). This suggests that a smaller dataset may
hinder effective learning, limiting the model’s ability to capture diverse patterns in financial ledger
descriptions. Larger training datasets are recommended to enhance model performance.
4.3 E STIMATION AND ANALYSIS OF SCOPE 3EMISSION OF FINANCIAL INDUSTRY
After mapping financial ledger descriptions to PCAF asset classes and EEIO summary commodity
industry/sector classes, we calculate financed emissions using the asset-specific formulation (A.1)
and EEIO emission factors (A.4). Appendix A.5 displays sample financial transactions, their classi-
fied asset and industry classes, and emission distribution. Notably, the correlation between expenses
and emissions is non-trivial and counter-intuitive, providing detailed insights for financial organiza-
tions to profile financed emission distribution and make informed decisions on future investments.
5 C ONCLUSION
This paper introduces a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) framework for enabling and ac-
celerating accurate estimation of financed emissions. In experiments, non-foundation models per-
form similarly to fine-tuned foundation models in asset class classification, while the latter excel
in industry class classification. The supervised fine-tuned foundation model outperforms zero-shot
classification. The domain-adapted foundation model matches the domain-expert performance in
industry class classification. Estimating financed emissions from readily available financial invest-
ment records mitigates the complexity and dependency on extensive data collection.It empowers
financial organizations for precise estimation, enabling informed decisions in line with Sustainable
Development Goal 13.

A.1 G LOBAL GHG A CCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARD FOR THE FINANCIAL
INDUSTRY
The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is a global coalition of more than 130
financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess
and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their loans and investments. The
PCAF was formed in 2015 by major European banks and investors, and has since expanded to
include members from North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific
Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry PCAF (2022) was de-
veloped by The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to meet the growing industry
demand for a global, standardized approach to measure and report financed emissions. The Standard
has been reviewed by the GHG Protocol and is in conformance with the requirements set forth in the

Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, for Category 15 investment
activities. The standard provides detailed methodological guidance to measure and disclose GHG
emissions associated with seven asset classes:
1.Listed equity and corporate bonds: These are securities issued by companies that are
traded on stock exchanges or over-the-counter markets. The PCAF standard provides meth-
ods to calculate the emissions of the companies based on their ownership or debt share.

A.2 C HALLENGES WITH ESTIMATING SUPPLY CHAIN EMISSIONS OF FINANCIAL INDUSTRY
Financed emissions are the greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with the activities and
projects that are financed by financial institutions, such as loans, investments, insurance and under-
writing. Some of the challenges associated with them are:
• Data Availability and Quality: Access to comprehensive and reliable data regarding the car-
bon footprint of invested companies and projects can be limited. Incomplete or inaccurate
data can lead to misleading estimations of emissions.
• Data Complexity: Analyzing emissions from diverse sectors, projects, and investments re-
quires understanding complex industrial processes, energy consumption patterns, and emis-
sions factors.
• Indirect Emissions: Calculating emissions beyond a financial institution’s direct control
(Scope 3 emissions) requires considering the broader supply chains and operations of in-
vested companies, which can involve diverse methodologies and data sources.
• Variability: The carbon intensity of investments can vary over time due to changes in busi-
ness practices, technology adoption, and regulatory shifts, making consistent and accurate
tracking difficult.
• Lack of Personnel Resources: In order to deal with the above issues, financial institutions
need a good management, leadership support as well as expertise in this area, which in
itself is not a simple task.
A.3 F RAMEWORK FOR ESTIMATING FINANCIAL EMISSION
A.4 US EEIO DATASET
The US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (US EEIO) model Yang et al. (2017) functions
as a life cycle assessment (LCA) tool, tracing the economic and environmental dynamics of goods
and services within the United States. This approach involves a comprehensive dataset and method-
ology that merges economic input-output analysis with ecological data. Its purpose is to quantify
the ecological impacts connected to economic endeavors. The US EEIO model is both open-source
and freely accessible, downloadable from the official website of the US Environmental Protection
Agency.
7Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
Under the US EEIO framework, products are classified into over 380 groups based on shared en-
vironmental characteristics, referred to as industry sector classes. These classes are strategically
aligned with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) codes. This ensures coherence and facilitates integration with existing economic
and ecological datasets. Complementing the detailed industry sector classifications, US EEIO also
furnishes emission factors for 66 condensed industry classes. These emission factors play a pivotal
role in estimating the environmental ramifications of expenditure data. Calculated for each industry
sector class, these factors shed light on the ecological implications tied to diverse economic activi-
ties.
