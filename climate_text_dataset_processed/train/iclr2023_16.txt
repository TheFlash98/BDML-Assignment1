ABSTRACT
The Climate Model Intercomparison Project provides access to ensembles of
model experiments that are widely used to better understand past, present, and
future climate changes. In this study, we use Principal Component Analysis and
K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques to guide identification of mod-
els in the CMIP6 dataset that are best suited for specific modelling objectives. An
example is discussed here that focuses on how CMIP6 models reproduce the phys-
ical properties of Antarctic Intermediate Water, a key feature of the global oceanic
circulation and of the ocean-climate system, noting that the tools and methods in-
troduced here can readily be extended to the analysis of other features and regions.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Climate models play a significant role in advancing the understanding of complex Earth systems and
provide important insights on the probable evolution and sensitivity of the climate system to climate
change, past and future (IPCC, 2021). The Climate Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6)
provides open access to a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art coupled model experiments. Transparent
access to the CMIP6 archive is key as it provides scientists and stakeholders worldwide with the
ability to independently compare the output of all climate models and thereby develop a sense of
confidence about projections of future climate and quantify uncertainties (Eyring et al., 2016).
Although general climate trends are mostly consistent between models, evaluation of model-to-
model differences reveals that substantial differences exist between model simulations on global
and especially regional scales, and that these biases also vary through time. For instance, Wang et
al., (2021) showed that the sea surface temperature biases differ significantly both regionally and
seasonally between CMIP6 models. Tools and advanced methods, such as those from the field of
artificial intelligence and machine learning, are needed to help analyse possible biases and extract
physically meaningful information from massive and increasing amounts of model output.
Here, we show how a combination of unsupervised machine learning methods can be used to per-
form a novel objective-oriented multi-model comparison and help identify the models that best
represent observed features of interest. This framework first aims to identify key individual vari-
ables/features using PCA analysis. Clustering methods are then used to decide how each model or
group of models represent properties/processes of interest. The workflow is illustrated using a case-
study that examines how CMIP6 models simulate the physical properties (e.g., salinity, temperature,
density, outcrop latitude, or extent latitude) of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in the Atlantic
Ocean. AAIW is a key component of the ocean-climate system and has a major impact on the global
ocean circulation. (Sloyan & Rintoul, 2001).

2 D ATA AND METHODS
2.1 M ULTI -MODEL ENSEMBLES OF CMIP6 CLIMATE MODELS AND OBSERVATIONAL DATA
In this study, we used output from 31 CMIP6 models, obtained from the Centre for Data Anal-
ysis (CEDA) Earth System Federation Grid node (https://esgf-index1.ceda.ac.uk/search/cmip6-
ceda/). The monthly mean ocean temperatures and salinities of each model were further aver-
aged over the 1991-2010 period and re-gridded to regular 1° resolution products that are used
for comparison with the World Ocean Atlas 2018 (Levitus et al. 2012) observational climatology
(https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-atlas-2018/) (see Appendix).
2.2 P HYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE AAIW
Antarctic Intermediate Water is a water mass which forms in the Southern Ocean and spreads north-
ward in all ocean basins. It is characterised by a strong mid-depth salinity minimum (the AAIW
core). AAIW plays a fundamental role in the global ocean circulation, and acts as an important
sink for atmospheric CO2 (Panassa et al., 2018). Despite its significance for the climate system,
climate models struggle to capture and simulate the properties, extent, and dynamics of AAIW, as
was shown by the analysis of Zhu et al. (2018) in the CMIP5 archive. We here analyse model
biases for AAIW in CMIP6 models to illustrate how machine learning-based approaches can be
used to help identify the models whose simulations are closest to the observations. Key properties
commonly used to describe AAIW in the oceanographic literature were computed. The density was
calculated using averaged ocean salinity and temperature. The depth of the AAIW core, as defined
by the salinity minimum at 20°S, was identified. Note that 20°S is chosen as it is one of the lati-
tudes where AAIW has subducted to the mid-depth of the oceans (Talley, 1999). The temperature,
salinity, and density of the AAIW core at 20°S were then estimated from the re-gridded outputs.
Other key variables related to the origin and extension of AAIW were calculated in the Atlantic at
25°W: 1) the outcrop location of AAIW in the Southern Ocean (i.e., the location where the AAIW
core reaches the mixed-layer in the upper ocean); 2) the northernmost latitudinal extent of AAIW
(maximum northward latitude at which the salinity minimum can be detected); 3) the depth extent
at this northernmost latitude location (Zhu et al., 2018; Meuriot et al., 2022). In total we have 7
variables/features associated with AAIW (see Figure 1.a and Table 1 in the Appendix).
2.3 A N UNSUPERVISED LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR OCEAN MODEL -DATA
Three unsupervised learning methods have here been applied to the analysis of CMIP6 model output
for assessing AAIW properties across the Atlantic region: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-
means clustering, and hierarchical clustering. The Scikit-learn library was used to process the data
and apply the unsupervised learning methods. The pre-processing steps involved standardising the
variables by centering and scaling each feature and replacing missing data with the mean value over
all models. PCA is a highly efficient algorithm for dimensionality reduction, which involves re-
ducing the number of input variables while minimising information loss (Tipping & Bishop, 1999).
Clustering techniques help segmenting groups with similar properties and assign them into clus-
ters. In the case of K-means clustering (Lloyd, 1982), it clusters data points based on similarity
or closeness between the data points. The number of clusters was selected using the Elbow Curve
method (Syakur et al., 2018) (see Figure 5.a in the Appendix). The optimal number was found to
be three clusters. The K-means algorithm was run 20 times, with a different random initialization of
the centroids (Lloyd, 1982). Hierarchical clustering is an alternative approach that identifies groups
in a dataset by using (in this case) the minimum or average linkage clustering method (Miyamoto
et al., 2015) (i.e., it essentially minimises the variance of the clusters being merged). The number
of clusters was selected based on the analysis of the dendrogram structure (Figure 5.b in the Ap-
pendix), which was also three (Sembiring et al., 2010). The three unsupervised learning methods
were applied on a matrix composed of 7 columns corresponding to the AAIW features (defined in
Section 2.2) with 32 rows (31 CMIP6 models and 1 observational dataset).

3 R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 A SSESSMENT OF VARIABLE IMPORTANCE
The PCA analysis was applied to better interpret the importance of each variable defined to charac-
terise AAIW (Section 2.2). The percentage of explained variance was calculated for each resulting
principal component (PC). The first two (or three) PCs explain over 70% (or 85%) of the data vari-
ance (Figure 1.b). The scores of the top-ranking PCs were obtained for each variable to evaluate how
much each variable contributes to the PC (Figure 1.c). The AAIW depth, density at 20°S, and the
extent (in terms of depth) strongly influence PC1 but have limited influence on PC2 and PC3. The
temperature at 20°S instead influences both PC1 and PC2. In contrast, the northernmost latitudinal
extent, AAIW core salinity and temperature at 20°S dominate PC2. The outcrop position was found
to have very little influence on PC1 and PC2 but dominates PC3.

The core of AAIW, defined by the mid-depth minimum in salinity, is marked by the black dots. The
variables compared in this study are the outcrop location (yellow dot), the temperature T, salinity
S, depth z and density ρat the core of AAIW at 20°S (white cross), and the depth and latitude of
the extent (Ext(lat), Ext(z)) of AAIW (magenta square). (b) Scree plot showing the percentage of
explained variance (EV) by each principal component (PC) (in red the cumulative sum). (c) Bar plot
of the influence score of each variable on the PCs: for PC1 (blue), PC2 (orange) and PC3 (green).
3.2 C OMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF CMIP6 MODELS OVER THE AAIW LAYER
Two different machine learning clustering approaches (see Section 2.3) were applied to the 7 fea-
tures of AAIW: hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering (shown projected onto the first two
PCs in Figures 2.a and 2.b respectively). General consistent clustering results between methods
provide more confidence of the analysis results. Both clustering approaches provide very similar
model membership to specific clusters, with the exception of five models (circled in black in Figure
2.b). The clustering results are also consistent with the PC projection where the 3 groups can be
visually distinguished. Overall, we found that models from Cluster 0 are closer to the results from
observations (marked with a black square in Figure 2).
Figure 2: (a) Hierarchical and (b) K-means clustering results projected on PC1 and PC2. The black
box highlights the results from the observational dataset. The black circles show the models for
which the (hierarchical and K-means) clustering results differ.

A physical attribution of the clusters is often difficult; however, it is possible to distinguish different
features. By further investigating each individual cluster projected on the PC1 and PC2 components,
we noted that the models in Cluster 1, which have higher PC1 values (Figure 2), are associated with
lower depth, higher temperature, and lower density (see Figure 3 for the hierarchical case). This
is in agreement with the PCA analysis in Section 3.1 (see Figure 1.c). The models in Cluster 2
show a reduced northward extent and have higher salinity values, whereas Cluster 0 models shows
further northward extent and the opposite pattern in terms of salinity. Hence, these results indicate
that several characteristics differentiate clusters and AAIW features. Furthermore, we found the
group of models (Cluster 0) that reproduces most closely the latitudinal extent, a feature that was
not properly captured in CMIP5 models (Zhu et al., 2018).

Section 2.2). Results from the hierarchical method. Cluster 0, 1, 2 highlighted in red, orange, and
green, respectively.
4 C ONCLUSIONS
The work presented here illustrates the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in the context
of model inter-comparison, where a large number of models are used. A case-study analysis of the
AAIW physical properties presented here shows that PCA analysis of CMIP6 multi-model datasets
can help identify those features that contribute the most in terms of explained variance. The clus-
tering techniques can help diagnose and select models which are more in line with observations (or
with any reference). They can also be used to identify the dominant differences between the clus-
ters. In the example discussed here, each resulting cluster appears to be associated with different
physical properties, suggesting different physical underlying processes or mechanisms, information
that is useful to guide further research. This study provides a workflow for unsupervised learning
techniques that can be easily generalized to other model inter-comparison experiments.
