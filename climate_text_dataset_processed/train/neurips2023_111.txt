AI assisted Search for Atmospheric CO2 Capture
Shivshankar
Abstract
Carbon capture technologies is an important tool for mitigating climate change
[42]. In recent years, polymer membrane separation methods have emerged as a
promising technology for separating CO2 and other green house gases from the
atmosphere. Designing new polymers for such tasks is quite difficult. In this work
we look at machine learning based methods to search for new polymer designs
optimized for CO2 separation. An ensemble ML models is trained on a large
database of molecules to predict permeabilities of CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 pairs. We
then use search based optimization to discover new polymers that surpass existing
polymer designs. Simulations are then done to verify the predicted performance
of the new designs. Overall result suggests that ML based search can be used to
discover new polymers optimized for carbon capture.
1 Introduction
Global warming and associated climate change is one of the most pressing and challenging problems
we are facing today [ 50]. Reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions is a critical in our efforts to
"prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with climate systems"1. One of the main strategies
for mitigating CO2 emissions is carbon capture. [ 7,24,42]. Membrane based separation methods are
a major contender for energy efficient and flexible carbon capture technologies [24, 8]
While polymeric membranes have been shown to be effective for seperation for small molecules [ 4],
including CO2 [ 19,46], the current efficiency of these polymers is not enough for developing truly
cost-efficient and flexible carbon capture systems [ 9,31]. One needs high CO2 permeable membranes
with atleast moderately high CO2/gas selectivity. Increasing CO2 permeability and selectivity of mem
branes are crucial for increasing the overall process throughput, reducing energy costs, and achieving
removal of greater amounts of CO2. However, there exists a well-known negative correlation between
these properties, which makes increasing both selectivity and permeability difficult [ 36,13]. This
is often expressed in terms of the Robeson upper bound [ 36], which represents the frontier of this
trade-off.
Contribution Our objective in this work, is to develop a ML-driven approach to tackle the problem
of designing polymer membranes focused on CO2 separation from air. As N2 and O2 are the dominant
component of the atmosphere (comprising more than 99% of gases); high membrane selectivity
for CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 pairs is important for this task; and so we focus on these metrics. From
experimental data, we train an ensemble multi-task ML model to predict a polymer’s permeability for
all three gases - CO2, N2, and O2 as well as its CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivity. Then, we employ a
RL based search algorithm to design new polymers and evaluated their performance with respect to
the Robeson upper bounds using these machine learning models. Using this framework we were able
to identify new polymer membranes that are promising for both CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 separations.

2 Background and Related Work
Robeson Bound The efficacy of gas seperation via a membrane is determined by two important
factors a) permeability i.e. the rate at which a gas can pass through a membrane, and b) selectivity
i.e. the ability of the membrane to selectively transport one gas while rejecting others. In the context
of gas separation membranes, there is often a tradeoff between permeability and selectivity [ 36]. In
Figure 1, we plot the selectivity and permeability of various polymers, and we can clearly see the
general decreasing trend.
While there are physical reasons for existence of this tradeoff [ 13], the Robeson bound is more an
empirical bound than an intrinsic one [ 37,40]. Identifying new materials that break this upper bound
has driven and continues to drive material research. Since Robeson’s initial work, improvement in
polymer sciences have pushed outward this ’empirical’ Robeson bound [ 35,11]. Indeed, for many
gas pairs the effective upper bounds was updated in 2019 [ 11]. In Figure1, we have plotted the
empirical Robson bound from Comesaña-Gándara et al. [11] which can be considered to be a Pareto
frontier of selectivity permeability tradeoff.
ML-aided Polymer Design The accurate and efficient property prediction is essential to the
design of polymers in various applications[ 26]. Traditionally, chemists and polymer scientists
have relied on physical simulation to study and predict properties of various molecules. These
simulations while accurate, are compute-intensive. On the other hand deep-ML models provide a
quick inference method, which has led to them their rising popularity in the field of property prediction
[14,1,22,10,29,30]. This has been further aided by the availability of multiple large scale datasets
[39,48,32,49], that are needed to develop accurate deep-learning models [ 41,43,18,28]. Recently,
with the advent of large language models, large transformer inspired architectures for doing property
predictions are also becoming popular [18, 45, 20].
Barnett et al. [5]show that machine learning models generalize well to the task of predicting polymer
properties to new polymer repeat units. Yang et al. [48] show a method to utilize this for interpretable
discovery of new polymers. However, these methods do not generate novel candidates, and instead
used a large database of possible designs. This simplifies the discovery process but cannot generate
either novel candidates or optimized candidates for gas separation task. Secondly, they did not focus
specifically on CO2 separation, and indeed their best polymers do not surpass the robeson bound for
the CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 pairs important for CO2 separation from air.
3 Method
Now we describe our approach to using ML for aiding polymer discovery for CO2 separation. The
basic design is simple and intuitive, and similar versions have been proposed in different contexts
such as drug discovery [ 47], exploring metal-organics [ 1], virtual screening [ 48]. Recently Giro et al.
[15], have proposed a similar framework for aiding discovery of new polymers for carbon capture.
2Overview We use a combination of ML-based property prediction, and RL-based search to effi-
ciently and effectively discover new molecules with desired properties, and then validate them with
molecular dynamics simulations.
The first step is to train machine learning (ML) models to predict the required properties, such as
selectivity and permeability, using existing training sets like PoLyInfo[32] and PI1M [27]. We refer
to this model as a Property Prediction Function (PPF) in our work. Once a well-trained and calibrated
PPF is available, the next stage is to utilize it in an objective function to discover new molecules. We
use a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that proposes new molecules to be evaluated. PPF is
used to estimate the desired properties for every new proposal, and the corresponding objective is
computed. The PPF estimates are then provided as a reward to the RL-based search methods, which
proceed iteratively to propose newer interesting molecules to evaluate. Finally, once a candidate pool
of interesting molecules are found, the predicted properties of a candidate are validated via a standard
molecular dynamics simulation.
Features and ML Model We train an ensemble model consisting of various machine learning
algorithms, such as elastic nets, boosted random forests (Xgboost), feed-forward neural networks
(FFN), graph convolutional networks (pGCN [ 33]) and Transformers (TransPolymer [ 45]) For the
classical models, we used chemically relevant descriptors including bond angles, ring type and
substructures, RDKit chemical descriptors [ 21] and Morgan fingerprints [ 38], among others. These
features are widely used in the literature and are known to be important for predicting various
properties of molecules [ 6]. In addition, we used learned embeddings for substructures and important
atoms in the neural network models. The larger deep-learning models, such as Transformers and
GCNs, were trained using both unsupervised losses and multi-task regression losses. To determine
the best ensemble, we conducted a grid search to optimize the hyperparameters and chose the best
ensemble based on cross-validation results.
Environment and Score/Reward Function The score function is the reward provided for the
agent to maximize. Ideally we want a polymer which has high CO2 permeability while also high
selectivity for CO2 compared to O2 and N2. A natural metric is the product of the pair selectivities
and CO2 permeability [ 48]. We use the estimate of selectivity and permeability produced by the PPF.
State and Policy Network Each state vector, represents a specific intermediate molecular configu-
ration. The policy network takes the current graph/molecule as state and chooses an action which is
applied to the current molecule to modify it. Each policy action is specified via three steps: I), the
identification of the specific site where a new fragment is to be introduced; II, the selection of the
new fragment itself; and III), the precise bonding site on the new fragment.
We use three different multi-layered perceptrons M1,M2,M3to parameterize each individual de-
cision of the three step policy action. Following the approach of Hwang et al. [17], Yang et al.
[47], we represent the current state molecule as an undirected graph, using a graph convolutional
network to obtain node embeddings that are then aggregated to produce a graph embedding. In the
first step, the M1takes as input node embeddings of each attachment site on the molecule and a
GCN ( H) based graph embedding of the entire molecule, and samples a site to expand the current
fragment. Next, a different GCN ( E) is used to compute graph embedding of the molecule with
contextualized information relevant for the chosen attachment site. This embedding is combined with
Hbased embeddings of candidate extension fragments to predict a distribution over the space of
valid fragments to add. Finally, both these decision are fed into M3next step, i.e. the joining site on
the new fragment.
4 Results
Molecular simulation on the discovered molecules suggest that these are effective units for CO2
separation. In Figure 2 we present in red few of the most promising candidates discovered by our
method overlayed against the Robeson bound figures. In general, the ensemble model predictions
well approximated the predicted properties given by molecular simulations, even when molecules are
optimized using the predicted value. While the model uncertainty is greater as the scoring networks
is used to extrapolate to unseen (and potentially out of distribution molecules), overall the results
seem validated by molecular simulations. More analysis of the results is present in the Appendix.

that surpass both upper bounds
5 Conclusion
In this work we present a ML driven framework for finding novel polymers for CO2 separation. The
framework involves using an ensemble of ML models to predict relevant properties like permeability
and sensitivity. This ML model is then used to compute a reward function for an RL based search
method to produce optimized polymer molecules. The proposed method is able to find close relatives
of recent high performance polymers. We verify with molecular simulation the predicted performance
of the proposed polymers, and find them to be reasonably accurate. Overall the framework shows
promise as an effective means of discovering novel polymers for CO2 separation from the atmosphere.
Limitations Our framework while easily adjustable to incorporate other important metrics like
synthetic accessibility, does not take them into consideration. Even ignoring questions of accessibility,
there are other factors important for gas separation that are ignored. A polymer’s gas filtration
performance also depends heavily on factors like morphology of the polymer, operating temperature
etc [34] which have been ignored here. Moreover, we have focused on separating CO2 from N2
and O2, and hence on atmospheric separation. Polymers for carbon separation at an industrial or
power plant are different, as they will function under different operating conditions and dealing with
post-combustion gases. Furthermore, even for molecules discovered this way, extensive simulation
via different methods and experimental analysis is required for stronger conclusions.

7A Analysis of Results
We first look at common substructures observed in polymers discovered by our methods. Some of
these are reported in Figure 3. Additionally we highlight the fragments which are also common in the
100 most high scoring existing polymers from our dataset. We find that combinations of arenes and
azaarenes, are common in both these sets of molecules. Additionally, a less common but promising
candidate discovered by our method is pyridine-3,5-diyl (depicted in the top-middle of Figure 3).
Studies have shown that pyridine-based poly-ethers are effective for developing CO2-separating
polymers [ 25,3]. In fact, our procedure has "discovered" a molecule that is related to one presented
in V ollas et al. [44], but was not present in the training or validation data used in the PPF.
Figure 3: Most common fragments for the best
performing discovered polymers. The first two
fragments also occurs with high frequency in best
known polymers. This suggests our procedure is
picking on these fragments to build better polymersFurthermore, our procedure has identified other
useful and common substructures, such as poly-
cyclic backbones and two fluoromethyl chains.
Trifluoromethyl side chains are known to cause
steric frustration and restricted mobility in poly-
mer chains [ 12]. This leads to high fractional
free volume, which favors increased gas per-
meability [ 16]. In addition, our discovered
polymers contain a larger number of aliphatic
rings, (which also increase steric hindrance),
and aromatic oxygen and nitrogen (polar atoms
that tend to increase solubility and selectiv-
ity). Similar findings were reported in Yang
et al. [48]. Overall, these results suggest that
our method has successfully discovered poly-
mers with promising structural features that are
known to improve gas separation properties.
RL and search procedures have the potential to
exploit the biases and gaps in the reward func-
tion [ 23,2]. Therefore, solely relying on the test
data performance of the trained models is not
sufficient, and it is critical to validate whether
our reward function generalizes to newer polymers discovered by our procedure. To this end, we
conducted a computer simulation on a sample of 100 molecules discovered by our search algorithm
and calculated their permeability for N2, O2, and CO2 gases, respectively. In Figure 4, we present the
predicted and simulation-based permeabilities for these polymers. The plot shows a generally good
agreement between the two values with a high R2value. However, at the very high and low values of
permeability, the model tends to be more optimistic than what simulations suggest, indicating the
presence of some overfitting in the ML model and/or reward-hacking by the RL search.
