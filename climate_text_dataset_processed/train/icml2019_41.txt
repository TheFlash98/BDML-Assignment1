AI & Climate Change: Workshop Prompt
 
Climate
change
is
widely
agreed
to
be
one
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
greatest
challenges
facing
humanity.
We
already
 
 
 
 
 
 
observe
increased
incidence
and
severity
of
storms,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
droughts,
fires,
and
flooding,
as
well
as
significant
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
changes
to
global
ecosystems,
including
the
natural
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resources
and
agriculture
on
which
humanity
depends.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The
2018
UN
report
on
climate
change
estimates
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
world
has
only
thirty
years
to
eliminate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
greenhouse
emissions
completely
if
we
are
to
avoid
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
catastrophic consequences.
 
 
Introduction
 
Extreme
weather
events
pose
an
enormous
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increasing
threat
to
the
nation’s
electric
power
systems
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
the
associated
socio-economic
systems
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
depend
on
reliable
delivery
of
electric
power.
The
US
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Department
of
Energy
reported
in
2015,
almost
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quarter
of
unplanned
grid
outages
were
caused
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extreme
weather
events
and
variability
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
environment.
Because
climate
change
increases
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequency
and
severity
of
extreme
weather
events,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communities
everywhere
will
need
to
take
steps
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
better
prepare
for,
and
if
possible
prevent,
major
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outages
​
.
​
While
utilities
have
software
tools
available
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
help
plan
their
daily
and
future
operations,
these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tools
do
not
include
capabilities
to
help
them
plan
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
recover
from
extreme
events.
Software
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resilient
design
and
recovery
is
not
available
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
commercially
and
research
efforts
in
this
area
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
preliminary.
In
this
project,
we
are
developing
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deploying
a
suite
of
novel
software
tools
to
anticipate,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absorb
and
recover
from
extreme
events.
The
tools
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
be
integrated
into
an
extensible
and
open
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
platform,
aiding
future
efforts
in
this
area,
and
will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
include
technology
built
with
the
unique
capabilities
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
SLAC,
LBNL,
GoogleX,
NRECA,
Packetized
 
 
 
 
 
 
Energy,
Presence
PG,
and
additional
utility
partners.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This
research
will
aid
the
DOE
OE
and
EERE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Resilient
Distribution
Grid
R&D
mission
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
developing
cutting-edge
resiliency
technologies
that
 
 
 
 
 
are
deployed
to
utilities
and
reducing
outage
costs
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
meet
the
MYPP
goal
and
DOE
major
outcome
of
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10%
reduction
in
the
economic
costs
of
power
outages
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by
2025.
According
to
the
DoE,
the
national
cost
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
power
outages
in
2012
in
the
US,
the
year
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Superstorm
Sandy,
was
between
$27
to
$52
billion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Working
towards
a
resilient
grid
is
not
just
a
matter
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
energy security, but also of economic security.
 
 
The goal of this project is to respond to grid events by:
 
1.
Demonstrating
machine
learning
and
 
 
 
 
artificial
intelligence
from
different
data
 
 
 
 
 
sources
to
​
anticipate
​
grid
events
due
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extreme
weather
and
distribution
system
 
 
 
 
 
events;
 
 
2.
Validating
controls
for
distributed
energy
 
 
 
 
 
resources
for
​
absorbing
grid
events
by
riding
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through with controllable loads; and
 
3.
Reducing
​
recovery
time
by
managing
 
 
 
 
 
distributed
energy
resources
in
the
case
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cyber attacks that impact communications.
 
 
 
The
project
builds
on
previous
efforts
to
collect
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
massive
amounts
of
smart
meter,
SCADA,
solar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generation,
electric
vehicle
charging,
satellite
imagery
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
weather
data
collection
and
use
them
to
fine-tune
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
grid
operations,
including

and

well
as
other
Grid
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Modernization
Lab
Consortium
projects
on
distributed
 
 
 
 
 
 
controls and cyber security.
 
 
The
innovations
in
the
project
include
the
application
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
artificial
intelligence
and
machine
learning
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution
grid
resilience,
specifically,
by
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
predictive
analytics,
image
recognition
and
 
 
 
 
 
classification,
and
increased
learning
and
problem
 
 
 
 
 
 
solving
capabilities
for
anticipation
of
grid
events.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
project
team
will
also
demonstrate
distributed
control
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
theory
with
and
without
communications
to
absorb
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and recover from grid events in Year 3.
 
 
Platform Architecture
 
This
three-year
project
will
deploy,
test
and
validate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
developing capabilities around the country.
 
●
Anticipation
analytics
will
be
tested
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
validated with Southern California Edison;
 
 
●
Absorption
algorithms
will
be
tested
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vermont
with
150+
controllable
loads
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
demonstrate virtual islanding capability; and
 
 
●
Extremum
seeking
controls
that
support
 
 
 
 
 
recovery
by
following
an
objective
function,
 
 
 
 
 
 
such
as
voltage
stabilization,
broadcasted
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
feeder
will
be
tested
with
one
of
NRECA
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
members.
 
 
 
The
Grid
Intelligence
and
Resilience
Platform
consists
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
two
layers:
the
data
platform
layer
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
application layer (as shown below).
 
 
 
 
The
data
platform
layer
includes
data
ingestion,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transformation,
and
management.
The
design
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
implementation
of
the
data
platform
layer
is
led
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Presence
PG
with
GoogleX
as
an
advisor.
Presence
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PG
has
access
to
existing
open-source
code
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Open
Modeling
Framework
(OMF)
and
VADER

NRECA
member.
At
a
Midwest
utility
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
location,
we
will
be
demonstrating
extremum
seeking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
algorithms
with
inverter-based
DERs
within
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution
feeder.
We
plan
to
have
PV
and
storage
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
devices
that
stabilize
the
voltage
at
a
distribution
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
substation
without
the
need
for
centralized
 
 
 
 
 
 
communication.
The
distribution
feeder
will
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
equipped
with
a
line
sensor
which
will
be
used
as
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proxy for extremum seeking controls.
 
 
 
Anticipation Analytics Simulation Analysis
 
For
the
first
phase
of
this
project
(Anticipation),
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
built
custom
GridLAB-D
implementations
 
 
 
 
incorporating
a
vulnerability
analysis,
which
includes
 
 
 
 
 
 
an
analytical
pole
and
line
vulnerability
model
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
input
weather
data.
This
was
done
by
calculating
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pole
vulnerability
index,
electrical
fault
propagation
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
restoration
time.
We
also
used
a
unidirectional
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wind
simulation
to
represent
the
worst
case
scenario.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We
also
made
enhancements
to
the
pole
vulnerability
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model
which
include
adding
in
the
effect
of
changing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wind
direction,
adding
an
ice
build-up
model
and
line
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
loading
effects,
and
extending
the
taxonomy
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impacts of vegetation on lines, poles, and equipment.
 
 
 
 
Next Steps
 
We
are
currently
working
towards
finalizing
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
predictive
analytics
requirements
for
the
Anticipation
 
 
 
 
 
 
use
case
and
will
be
demonstrating
power
balancing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
water
heaters
through
virtual
islanding
for
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption use case in September.
