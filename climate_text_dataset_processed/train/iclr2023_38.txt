ABSTRACT
With the goal of understanding effective strategies to communicate about climate
change, we build interpretable models to rank tweets related to climate change
with respect to the engagement they generate. Our models are based on the
Bradley-Terry model of pairwise comparison outcomes and use a combination
of the tweets’ topic and metadata features to do the ranking. To remove confound-
ing factors related to author popularity and minimise noise, they are trained on
pairs of tweets that are from the same author and around the same time period
and have a sufficiently large difference in engagement. The models achieve good
accuracy on a held-out set of pairs. We show that we can interpret the parameters
of the trained model to identify the topic and metadata features that contribute to
high engagement. Among other observations, we see that topics related to climate
projections, human cost and deaths tend to have low engagement while those re-
lated to mitigation and adaptation strategies have high engagement. We hope the
insights gained from this study will help craft effective climate communication to
promote engagement, thereby lending strength to efforts to tackle climate change.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Climate change is arguably one of the most important challenges facing humanity today with im-
pacts on a global scale. While surveys indicate that a majority of the population in many countries
is now knowledgeable about climate change and its impacts, the level of awareness and support
for climate-friendly policies still vary widely among people from different countries, income and
education levels and age groups (Leiserowitz et al. (2022), Flynn et al. (2021)). It is important to
use communication to spread awareness and promote engagement among the groups that are less
involved in order to further increase the scale of actions towards mitigation and adaptation and pres-
sure lawmakers and governments to create and enforce climate-friendly laws.
There are several subtopics within climate change including its causes, impacts and mitigation and
adaptation strategies. The potential to create engagement is likely to be different for each of these
subtopics. For instance, complex technical details might be less appealing than vivid descriptions
of impacts or promising solutions. Our goal in this work is to discover in a data-driven way which
strategies of communication, as defined by the subtopics being emphasised, are more effective in
creating engagement among a general audience.
The data source that we use for this study is Twitter. Twitter is extensively used for climate change
communication by individuals, activist groups, and government agencies. Each tweet is associated
with several metrics such as the number of likes,retweets , and replies , that quantify the engagement
that it generates. All tweets along with their metadata are publicly available and can be easily
accessed through the Twitter API, enabling us to curate a large and rich dataset on which to train
interpretable engagement prediction models.
However, a significant challenge in building such models is the presence of confounding factors
such as author popularity. A tweet might generate strong engagement because its author is popular
rather than because of its engaging content. Another potential confounder is the change in public
interest in climate change over time. For instance, tweets about climate change made around the
time of extreme weather or a major climate change conference might receive greater attention than
tweets at other times. We minimise the effect of such confounders by defining the task as comparing

the engagement within a pair of tweets rather than predicting the engagement for a given tweet. The
pair of tweets are chosen to be from the same author and from the same window in time.
Climate change communication is an active area of research and the question of which strategies are
best to promote engagement has been well-studied in the area (Agin & Karlsson (2021)). Gustafson
et al. (2020) find that sharing personal stories on the radio about the harmful impacts of climate
change can be a persuasive strategy. Xia et al. (2021) analyse the spreading behaviour of climate-
related tweets and identify the factors responsible for virality from a dataset obtained through manual
coding of a small number of tweets.
Tweet engagement prediction in general (not restricted to climate change) is also a well-studied
problem. Tan et al. (2014) study the effect of wording on engagement by comparing pairs of tweets
from the same user about the same topic. More recently, Wang et al. (2018) used multimodal in-
formation (images and text) to predict retweet behaviour. Topic modelling (inferring latent topics
in text) has been used in Dahal et al. (2019) to understand which topics are prevalent in the global
climate change discourse. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply topic modelling in
a pairwise comparison framework to predict engagement in climate change tweets and interpret the
learned model to understand the engaging subtopics.
The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we describe the dataset of tweets that we curated.
The features we use for prediction and our model architecture are given in Section 3. We describe
training and evaluation and discuss our results in section 4 and conclude the paper in section 5.
2 D ATASET
We use the Twitter API to obtain 8,041,921 tweets related to climate change created between January
1st 2021 and November 4th 2022. To decide whether a tweet is related to climate change, we check
if it contains one of the keywords in the ‘General’ topic category of UN Global Pulse (2014), a
taxonomy for studying climate change tweets. We keep only the tweets in English (94.28% of the
dataset). For each tweet, we keep its full text, author and information about whether it contains
URLs, hashtags, animated GIFS, images or videos. We also keep the public engagement metrics
about the tweet, i.e. the number of likes, retweets and replies that it obtained.
We then construct the pairs of tweets to compare. For each author, we go through their history
and obtain pairs of tweets that were created within 7 days of each other and have a difference in
engagement (sum of likes, retweets and replies) of 100 units or 10%, whichever is higher. This
method of creating pairs ensures that we avoid confounding factors related to the author and time
and minimise the noise in the comparison. We finally end up with 774,507 pairs of tweets which we
use for training our engagement prediction model.
3 M ODEL
Our model uses both the topic of the tweets in a pair as well as their metadata features to predict
which of the two tweets receives greater engagement.
3.1 F EATURES
To infer the topics present in a tweet, we use the TopClus method which is described in Meng
et al. (2022). The method uses a pre-trained language model called BERT (Devlin et al. (2019))
in combination with an attention model to represent texts (tweets in our case). It then uses a latent
variable model to cluster these representations into topics in an unsupervised fashion. The learned
topics can be interpreted by looking at the tweets whose representations are closest to the centre of
the clusters. Once the model is trained on a set of tweets, it can be used to infer the probability that
a new tweet belongs to each of the topics (i.e. compute the tweet’s topic probability distribution).
The number of clusters or topics Kis a parameter that needs to be set prior to training the TopClus
model.
In order to have a good representation of the tweets for clustering, we pre-process their texts to be
similar to the texts used for training the BERT model by dropping URLs, mentions and hashtags.
Due to computational constraints, we train the TopClus model on a 10% random sample of our
2Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023
dataset instead of the full dataset. We then use the trained model to infer the topic probability
distributions of all the remaining tweets in our dataset. Thus, in the end, we have for each tweet ia
topic feature vector ti∈RK1.
In addition to topic features, we also include metadata features for each tweet. These are represented
as binary values (1 if the corresponding feature is present, 0 if not), and capture the presence of
URLs, hashtags, animated GIFs, images and videos. We also include a binary value to represent
if the tweet was created during working hours (weekdays, 9 am-5 pm) on the east coast of the US
which is likely to have a large fraction of the audience, namely English Twitter users. We represent
the metadata features of tweet ibymi∈R6.
3.2 M ODEL ARCHITECTURE
The model that we use is reminiscent of the Bradley-Terry model of pairwise comparison outcomes
Bradley & Terry (1952). We define the probability that tweet iin a pair gets more engagement than
the other tweet jto be
P(i≻j) =esi
esi+esj, (1)
where si, sj∈Rare the engagement potentials of tweets iandjrespectively. The higher the
engagement potential of a tweet, the more likely it is to have higher engagement in a pair.
We model the engagement potential as a linear function of the topic and metadata features. More
precisely we define
si=wtTti+wmTmi, (2)
where wt∈RKandwm∈R6are the learned vectors of coefficients for topics and metadata
respectively. The choice of a linear model enables us to easily understand the effect of the features
(and thereby find effective strategies that are correlated with high engagement) by interpreting the
coefficient values. We train three versions of our model that differ in the features they include: Meta
(onlymi),Topic (onlyti) and Topic+Meta (bothtiandmi)
Note however that the model as defined so far is not identifiable with respect to the topic coefficients
wt(we cannot precisely estimate their values). In fact, if we modify the model by adding a constant
to each of these coefficients we get the same predictions. This can be seen by noting that the sum of
the components of topic vectors tiare always one (as they are probability distributions). To avoid
this issue we fix one of the coefficients to be zero.2
4 E XPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
We split our dataset of tweet pairs chronologically3into training, validation and testing sets in the
ratio 90:5:5. We train our models by finding the optimal set of coefficients wt,wmthat maximise
the probability of the pairs in the training set under the model in equation 1. We use classification
accuracy as our evaluation metric as our dataset is balanced and errors are symmetric.
We do not use regularisation as overfitting is unlikely (our model is simple and we have a large
amount of data). Indeed, we see from the validation performance that overfitting does not occur. We
re-train on the union of the train and validation sets and report our accuracy on the test set (see Table
1). For comparison, we also report the human accuracy obtained by one of the authors labelling 200
random pairs from the test set.
We see that all our models significantly outperform the random baseline and achieve performance
comparable to a human. Topic outperforms Meta and the best performance of 66.53% is achieved
byTopic+Meta , suggesting that the two features provide complementary information. Tan et al.
1We useK= 100 as it gave interpretable topics. It is also the default value suggested in Meng et al. (2022).
2The choice of this coefficient does not affect the relative ordering of coefficients and their interpretation.
3We split chronologically rather than randomly as that is closer to a real setting where we would want to
predict the engagement of future tweets based on past tweets.

(2014) report a similar accuracy for models based on wording and metadata when predicting relative
engagement of tweets containing the same URL. We also tried models using the words as features,
instead of topics. However the accuracy was slightly lower, and the interpretation was more difficult
for those models as a clear pattern couldn’t be seen among the most predictive words. The accuracy
for word-based models could possibly be increased by using contextual word embeddings and state-
of-the-art sequence models like Transformers (Vaswani et al. (2017)), but their interpretation is likely
to still be difficult.
We re-train Topic+Meta on the complete set of pairs to obtain the coefficients for interpretation (see
Table 2). A higher coefficient indicates more engagement. Due to limited space in the table, we
only include the top 24 topics in terms of their prevalence in our data, in addition to the 6 metadata
features. The names of the topics were manually assigned by examining the top 500 tweets with the
highest probability for the topic. A random sample of 10 tweets from this set for each of the topics
in the table is given in the Appendix for a more detailed interpretation.
Topics without much useful content such as Links/Promo clearly have low engagement. Tweets
about the long-term Projections of climate change effects also have low engagement, which could
be due to the temporal discounting of risks that are far away. Topics such as the Human cost of
climate change and Deaths have low engagement, as do the topic of stocks and Investment .
Topics that contribute to high engagement include discussion of the President ’s actions and adap-
tation and mitigation strategies such as Drought-resistant plants and Clean Energy . Interestingly,
tweets about climate change impacts in Africa receive high engagement, as do those about climate
change on other Planets and in Earth’s geological history. Tweets about climate change Conferences
andResearch get a moderate level of engagement. .
Looking at the coefficients for metadata features, we can see that tweets that include URLs tend to
receive less engagement (probably due to less information in the tweet itself). As one might expect,
tweets created during working hours also receive less engagement. On the other hand, tweets that
contain animated GIFs, videos or images tend to receive higher engagement.
5 C ONCLUSION
In this work, we curated a large dataset of tweets related to climate change and built interpretable
predictive models of tweet engagement. We avoid confounding factors by formulating the task as
a pairwise comparison of engagement among a pair of tweets from the same author around the
same time. The models achieve good accuracy on a held-out set of pairs. By interpreting the
coefficients of the models we could discover the topic and metadata features that are correlated with
high engagement. This information could conceivably be used to guide the creation of new climate-

related tweets and other climate communication to promote engagement among the population,
thereby giving strength to citizen-driven efforts to tackle the issue of climate change.
