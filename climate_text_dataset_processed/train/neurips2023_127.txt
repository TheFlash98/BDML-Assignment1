1 Introduction
The maritime industry, long hailed as a vital artery of global trade and commerce, faces a pressing
challenge on an unprecedented scale: the urgent need to decarbonize. The escalating rate of energy
consumption and its consequential greenhouse gas emissions have compelled regulatory bodies, such
as the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to institute stringent rules mandating a substantial
reduction in emissions [1], [2]. Despite being one of the most carbon-efficient modes of transportation,
it contributed 2.02% of global CO2 emissions in 2018. To confront this paradox, the industry is
turning to data-driven decision support models.
In an era where data and computing capacities are reaching unprecedented levels, the maritime
sector is ready to leverage artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analytics
to revolutionize its operations. Under the banner of Maritime 4.0, digitalization, automation, and
optimization are reshaping maritime logistics [3]. This transformation extends beyond efficiency,
encompassing critical areas such as supply chain management, emissions tracking, and port operations
enhancement [4].
This proposal explores the intersection of data science and maritime logistics, highlighting the pivotal
role of data-driven models in mitigating the industry’s carbon footprint. By examining various
data-driven approaches, from AI-aided navigation to statistical analysis for efficiency improvements,
the transformative potential of these technologies is unveiled [5], [6]. Supply chain optimization,

for maritime decarbonization.
As the maritime industry steers toward a zero-emission future, it stands at the forefront of this
monumental task [7]. Equipped with digital innovations, it promises not only efficiency gains but
also significant carbon emissions reduction.
2Prior studies on data-driven approaches for reducing emissions in maritime
operations
Within the maritime industry, the era of data-driven transformation has dawned, opening a realm of
possibilities to enhance operational efficiency and reduce emissions. This section looks at the data-
driven models and methodologies that are leading the way to a more sustainable and economically
sustainable maritime future.
2.1 Data analytics approaches
AIS data analysis for emissions estimation: Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data, often
underutilized, proves to be a valuable resource for both emissions estimation and navigation optimiza-
tion. Data analytics unveil its potential for calculating emissions and optimizing routes, achieving
substantial reductions in fuel consumption and emissions [8].
Big data analytics for ship performance monitoring: The huge amount of data coming from
modern ships’ sensors and systems has driven the development of analytical frameworks. These
frameworks employ techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to monitor ship performance,
enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency while mitigating emissions [9].
2.2 ML models
At the forefront of our exploration lies the realm of ML, a specific component within the larger field
of Artificial Intelligence. We are particularly interested in the ML aspect of AI within the maritime
context.
ML-based estimators for fuel consumption: ML takes center stage in estimating fuel consumption.
ML-based estimators, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employ diverse operating conditions
to optimize vessel energy efficiency, facilitating greener maritime operations [6].
ML for ship performance prediction: Predictive capabilities become paramount with statistical
models and ML techniques, such as Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and ANN. These models delve into ship performance
prediction, including fuel consumption forecasting. Their insights help operators fine-tune operations
for optimal efficiency and emissions reduction [10]–[12].
Data-driven approaches for sustainable shipping: ML frameworks have emerged as indispens-
able tools for determining the most energy-efficient shipping routes. By analyzing historical AIS and
weather data, these frameworks steer vessels toward eco-friendly paths, yielding notable reductions
in fuel consumption and emissions [5].
ML and statistical analysis for fuel efficiency: ML and high-dimensional statistical analysis work
in conjunction to optimize routes and fuel efficiency. By considering environmental factors and
real-time ship operation data, these approaches leverage advanced algorithms to maximize energy
efficiency and minimize emissions [13], [14].
Incorporating these data-driven models and methods into maritime operations signifies a shift towards
sustainability, where reducing emissions and improving efficiency are the guiding principles. This
recognizes the transformative potential of these approaches, not only for the maritime industry, but
also as leading innovators in the fight against climate change.
23Unlocking emissions reduction through ML models in maritime operations
Within the maritime realm, the integration data-driven models and advanced ML solutions has
emerged as a transformative approach to curb emissions. Our proposition delves into diverse
domains, seamlessly interconnecting various facets of maritime operations, each empowered by ML
technologies.
These ML models, continuously learning from the evolving data landscape, enable precise decision-
making, reducing unnecessary fuel consumption and emissions. A centralized ML system empowers
operators to monitor and control emissions in real-time, making instant adjustments. By seamlessly
integrating ML technologies with existing maritime infrastructure, our approach offers a practical
and realistic pathway to harmonize operations, significantly minimize environmental impact, and
navigate the maritime industry toward a more sustainable future.
First and foremost, optimizing ship speed is the key to our approach. By merging real-time data from
ships, ML algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
predict and optimize ship speeds, allowing vessels to navigate the most energy-efficient routes, thus
minimizing fuel consumption and emissions [5]. This optimized speed not only reduces emissions
directly but also serves as the foundation for subsequent operational enhancements.
Accurate estimation of ships’ arrival times is the natural progression from optimized speeds. Real-time
data on weather conditions, vessel characteristics, and route specifics enable precise ETA predictions,
employing algorithms like DT [15]. This precision facilitates efficient scheduling and minimizes
unnecessary fuel consumption and emissions related to prolonged voyages or waiting times at ports.
With optimized speeds and accurate ships arrival time predictions, we focus on improving quayside
planning. ML models predict and reduce the time vessels spend at berths, minimizing idle time and
emissions [16]. This streamlined quayside operation ensures a swift unloading process, employing
algorithms like KNN, allowing vessels to promptly proceed to their next destination, further reducing
overall emissions.
Efficient resource allocation and scheduling are then facilitated by the streamlined operations. ML
algorithms optimize the allocation of critical resources such as cranes, labor, and equipment, mini-
mizing downtime and emissions [17]. Reduced waiting times at ports and efficient quayside planning,
powered by algorithms ANN, result in faster cargo handling. This enables resources to be utilized
optimally, reducing emissions associated with idle time and inefficient resource usage.
These improvements in turn enhance supply chain monitoring. Real-time visibility into cargo
movements and inventory, facilitated by ML models including DT [18], ensures efficient routing
and minimizes delays. The accurate data on ship schedules and cargo availability enable precise
coordination between various stakeholders, reducing emissions linked to supply chain disruptions
and inefficiencies.
Lastly, real-time monitoring and control of ships’ emissions are made more effective through these
streamlined operations. Continuous data collection and analysis enable real-time adjustments in
vessel operations, empowering operators to meet stringent environmental targets and reduce emissions
further.
This proposal illustrates how ML models can play a key role in reducing emissions in various areas of
the industry. Each focus area represents a vital note in this transformative composition, demonstrating
the power of ML in creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly maritime future.
4 Conclusion
In conclusion, the maritime industry is on the brink of a sustainable revolution, powered by ML
decision support models. By optimizing ship speeds, predicting accurate arrival times, refining
quayside operations, optimizing resource allocation, and enabling real-time emissions control, these
models offer a clear path to emissions reduction and operational efficiency. As we sail toward a
zero-emission future, collaboration and innovation are essential. The maritime sector has the potential
not only to meet global trade demands but also to significantly reduce its carbon footprint, ensuring a
more sustainable future for all.
