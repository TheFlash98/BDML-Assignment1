ABSTRACT
Due to climate change, thawing permafrost affects transportation infrastructure in
northern regions. Tracking deformations over time of these structures can allow
identifying the most vulnerable sections to permafrost degradation and implement
climate adaptation strategies. The Sentinel-2 mission provides data well-suited for
multitemporal analysis due to its high temporal resolution and multispectral cov-
erage. However, the geometrical misalignment of Sentinel-2 imagery makes this
analysis challenging. Towards the goal of estimating the deformation of linear in-
frastructure in northern Canada, we propose an automatic subpixel coregistration
algorithm for satellite image time series based on the matching of binary masks
of roads produced by a deep learning model. We demonstrate the feasibility of
achieving subpixel coregistration through alignment of roads on a small dataset
of high-resolution Sentinel-2 images from the town of Gillam in northern Canada.
This is the first step towards training a road deformation prediction model.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Permafrost is soil or rock that remains at or below 0◦Cfor at least two consecutive years (Liu
et al., 2022). Climate warming has adversely affected permafrost areas, resulting in an accelerated
thawing process and an increase in thickness of the active layer (Bishop et al., 2011). According
to the latest report on climate change (Bush & Lemmen, 2019), Canada has been warming at about
twice the rate of the entire globe. In fact, between 1948 and 2016, the average annual temperature
has increased by close to 1.7◦C, and 2.3◦Cin the northern region. These effects have implications
for transportation infrastructure, which in turn may also affect communities access to transportation
services for commuting, healthcare, and for the movement of goods and resources.
While all transportation systems get impacted by the climate, northern transportation systems in
Canada experience some of the greatest impacts on account of degrading permafrost (Palko & Lem-
men, 2017). Permafrost thawing (ground settlement, slope instability, drainage issues, cracking)
causes damages to roads, railways, airport taxiways, and runways (Palko & Lemmen, 2017). Track-
ing changes over time in the surface deformation of transportation infrastructure can allow us to
monitor the quality of the underlying permafrost by correlating these changes to geophysical and
hydrological data.
The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery mission, conducted by the European Space Agency (ESA),
provides high-resolution imagery of Earth’s surface suitable for multitemporal analyses of small
geographic features down to subpixel size (Radoux et al., 2016). However, the multitemporal coreg-
istration accuracy of S2 Level 1C data products is currently of 12 m (Gascon et al., 2017a) which
results in coregistration errors within S2 time series of more than one full pixel in the visible (VIS)

and near-infrared (NIR) bands. These inaccuracies are expected to be reduced after the activation
of the Global Reference Image (GRI) (Enache & Clerc, 2023), nevertheless there are no plans for
reprocessing past data (Gascon et al., 2017b; Storey et al., 2016). Such settings are insufficient for
multitemporal analysis and claim for better methods to eliminate pixel and subpixel inconsistencies.
Traditional approaches to address the problem of image coregistration in remote sensing provide low
residual offsets after registration, which are unsuitable to analyze changes in small features such as
roads and railways. For instance, Rufin et al. (2021) achieved a mean coregistration precision of
4.4 m, while Stumpf et al. (2018) suggests that through an affine transformation, a residual Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) of approximately 3 mis possible.
In this work, instead of performing matching in the space of remote sensing images, we propose
a multitemporal image co-registration method using the Enhanced Cross-Correlation (ECC) crite-
rion Evangelidis & Psarakis (2008) to match road masks. These masks are represented as binary
images produced by a road segmentation deep learning model trained in a supervised manner. The
contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
1. We propose an adaptation of a SOTA deep learning road extraction architecture (Zhou et al.,
2018) able to process S2 data and generate accurate road classification masks.
2. We introduce a curated dataset of high-resolution optical S2 imagery from the region of
interest with pixel-level labels of roads.
3. We propose an image alignment algorithm for binary images of detected road networks for
the coregistration of multitemporal satellite image time series.

To validate our method we introduce a dataset of satellite images acquired from the Copernicus
Sentinel-2 earth observation mission. The dataset consists of 2051 high-resolution S2 satellite im-
ages from the town of Gillam, Manitoba in northern Canada. The corresponding region of interest
was buffered by 0.5 km and subsequently split into smaller more manageable tiles of 2.5 km×
2.5 km (see Appendix A for details). The images were obtained for each tile for the period be-
tween January and December of 2020 and only those with a maximum cloud coverage of 80% were
downloaded. We used only the VIS and NIR bands corresponding to the highest resolution of 10 m
resulting in images of size 250×250pixels.
The dataset images were annotated for roads based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) vector data (OSM
codes 5111-5115, 5121-5124, 5131-5135 and 5141) where we would only need to adjust the road
centerline annotations to a reference base image. The base image is a mosaic for the region of interest
composed of summer images from July 2020 since they exhibit the greatest color contrast and thus
allow for better distinction of geographical features. The curated road centerline annotations were
buffered by 5 mand rasterized at a resolution of 2.5 mper pixel. These annotations were used for
all of the images of the time series under the assumption that the roads in the region of interest do
not change, or change very slightly, during the time interval of the time series.
3 M ETHODS
3.1 R OAD NETWORK EXTRACTION
Having a robust road network extraction model is critical to obtaining accurate road masks and thus
to the performance of our algorithm. As basis for our method we adopt the D-LinkNet (Zhou et al.,
2018) architecture, winner of the CVPR DeepGlobe 2018 Road Extraction Challenge (Demir et al.,
2018). This network combines the power of dilated convolutions (Yu et al., 2017) and residual
connections (He et al., 2016) with the popular U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015) architecture for
semantic segmentation. To cope with the low spatial resolution of the S2 images we follow a strategy
similar than Ayala et al. (2021) and apply bilinear interpolation to the input images with Gaussian
smoothing to avoid aliasing effects. This way we upsample the images from their raw size of 250×
250pixels to a size of 1024×1024 pixels. Upsampled images combined with the ground truth
masks rasterized at 2.5 mper pixel allow to produce high accuracy road masks from S2 images.

3.2 M ULTITEMPORAL COREGISTRATION
We address the task of multitemporal SITS coregistration as an image alignment problem of binary
images using the ECC criterion. The main concept of our SITS coregistration algorithm is illustrated
in Figure 1. Given a SITS, we put all images in the same reference frame by aligning the detected
road masks against a reference road mask and use the obtained transformation matrices to warp the
satellite images (see Appendix C for algorithm pseudocode). The reference road mask corresponds
to the satellite image closest in time to the one in the base image mosaic used for annotation.
Figure 1: SITS Coregistration. We forward a time series of satellite images (a) through a road extraction
model (b) and obtain a time series of road masks (c) from which we pick a reference road mask. The resulting
road masks are aligned to the reference road mask and we obtain a set of warp matrices (d) that we use to obtain
warped satellite images from the time series (e).
With the aid of a previously trained road extraction model, we generate for each satellite image a
binary road mask that indicates whether or not a pixel corresponds to a road. Due to the geometrical
misalignment of the satellite images, the generated binary images are not directly comparable to
each other and require to be put under a common reference frame. We pick one of these road masks
to use as a reference and find the geometric transform (warp matrix) between every other road mask
and the reference road mask in terms of the ECC criterion. The obtained transformation matrices
are finally used to correct the offsets of the images in the time series. We consider only translation
motion at a maximum range of 50 m otherwise we fallback to an identity transformation.
3.3 R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our goal is to put misaligned images from a time series in the same frame of reference to enable
accurate further analysis. To evaluate how well our method addresses this problem we perform two
sets of experiments, 1) we investigate the robustness of our road extraction model under different
settings and 2) we perform a quantitative analysis of our coregistration algorithm in comparision
with a standard coregistration method in terms of image alignment and road detection quality.
In the first set of experiments, we train a D-LinkNet network with two different backbone networks
in a fully supervised manner. Following previous works Lian et al. (2020), we use a combination of
Dice and Binary Cross-Entropy loss to address the class imbalance due to the low presence of roads
on the images. To assess the robustness of our method, we randomly split the dataset into 5 folds
and evaluate the models for each of them and across multiple runs. In all cases, we trained for 300
epochs with batches of 8 elements using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2×10−4and a
threshold of 0.5 on the output binary masks.

To measure the road detection accuracy of each model we calculate Precision, Recall and Intersec-
tion Over Union (IoU). Table 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each metric and fold
across five runs. We observe that the additional parameters and residual connections of ResNet-34
allow it to capture more complex representations of the images and achieve a higher IoU. With either
backbone in three out of five folds the model achieves a high recall but low precision, i.e. it returns a
large amount of false positives. This is indicative that we have trained our models to detect as roads
pixels which are not roads, e.g. embankments or deposits of snow along the road. We hypothesize
that a higher multitemporal alignment would result in a higher road detection accuracy.

Table 1: Performance of our road extraction model measured across five folds and using five runs per fold.
For the second set of experiments, we run our algorithm on the road masks produced by the models
with ResNet-34 backbone. As baseline, we use AROSICS (Stumpf et al., 2018) to sequentially
match pairs of images from last to first in the NIR band, as it is less susceptible to seasonal changes.
Table 2 shows the performance of both methods in terms of IoU and Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM) to assess visual consistency1. Our method achieves an increase in road detection accuracy
across all folds ( ∼6 %in IoU) at the cost of a small decrease in visual consistency ( ∼2 %in SSIM).
Conversely, the baseline prioritizes visual consistency and registers an increase in visual consistency
(∼2 %in SSIM) at the expense of a decrease ( ∼5 %in IoU) in road detection accuracy.

Table 2: Road detection accuracy and image alignment quality after coregistration.
These results are not surprising given that our method favors alignment of detected structures and
relies on the accuracy of the road extraction model to keep visual consistency. Oppositely, meth-
ods like AROSICS favor visual consistency and disregard inconsistencies in smaller structures. Our
initial hypothesis that increased multitemporal alignment would result in a higher road detection ac-
curacy was correct, nevertheless the results also indicate a trade off between road detection accuracy
and visual consistency.
4 C ONCLUSIONS
With the end goal of estimating the deformation of linear infrastructure due to permafrost degrada-
tion, in this work we presented a novel method for satellite images coregistration to enable accurate
multitemporal analyses. We introduced a dataset of S2 images from the town of Gillam in north-
ern Canada and adapted a SOTA road network extraction architecture to operate on S2 imagery.
Through a quantitative analysis we proved that a higher road detection accuracy is possible through
the alignment of detected structures at the cost of a decrease in visual consistency.
Aligning binary road masks has several advantages over aligning remote sensing images; namely,
they are less sensitive to seasonal variability; they have less clutter easing the alignment process;

and finally, they are more consistent across time. In spite of this, one of the main challenges of
our method remains the need of a highly accurate classification model. Investigating the effect of
inaccurate annotations in the task of roads segmentation constitutes an interesting research direction.
On the perspective of climate change, the proposed method can serve as the basis for a multimodal
fusion model due to its agnostic nature to the satellite sensor and geographical features used for
matching. Such fusion model would further facilitate the ultimate goal of training a road deformation
prediction model. In this sense, we intend to evolve this work into a learnable model capable of
handling misaligned images and still producing accurate detection results useful for downstream
multitemporal analyses.

A R EGION OFINTEREST
Our main study region is the town of Gillam located in the province of Manitoba in northern Canada.
The administrative region was obtained from OSM and subsequently buffered by 0.5 km and split
into455tiles of 2.5 km×2.5 km . The dataset images belong only to tiles where there is a road, i.e.,
images with a certain road presence ( 0.1 %).

B D ATASET IMAGES
Sentinel-2 images consist of 13 spectral bands at different spatial resolutions, only the VIS and NIR
bands are at 10 m . In our training experiments of the road extraction models, we only used the
VIS bands corresponding to the RGB channels. This was due to the fact that the ResNet backbones
were previously trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is made of only RGB images. However we
downloaded as well the NIR band used for matching in the AROSICS baseline.
