Abstract
While many accept climate change and its grow-
ing impacts, few converse about it well, limit-
ing the adoption speed of societal changes nec-
essary to address it. In order to make effective
climate communication easier, we aim to build
a system that presents to any individual the cli-
mate information predicted to best motivate and
inspire them to take action given their unique set
of personal values. To alleviate the cold-start prob-
lem, the system relies on a knowledge base (Cli-
mateKB) of causes and effects of climate change,
and their associations to personal values. Since
no such comprehensive ClimateKB exists, we re-
visit knowledge base construction techniques and
build a ClimateKB from free text. We plan to
open source the ClimateKB and associated code
to encourage future research and applications.
1. Introduction
Today, climate change is widely recognized as one of the
biggest and most threatening global challenges currently
facing humanity (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). While
72% of adult Americans think global warming is happening,
there is a lack of acceptance that it personally affects us and
a lack of motivation to address it, according to 2020 national
public opinion polling (Howe et al., 2015; Leiserowitz A. &
E., 2021). This is demonstrated by how 47% think global
warming will harm them little or not at all, and that 2 out of
every 3 Americans rarely or never discuss climate change.
Lack of public engagement on climate change for any coun-
try can threaten its ability to reach its Nationally Determined
Contribution to reduce emissions for the Paris agreement.
Another critical reason for the lack of motivation for action
and disconnect with personal risk acceptance are cognitive

Learning , PMLR 139, 2021. Copyright 2021 by the author(s).biases, such as conﬁrmation bias, motivated reasoning, and
cultural cognition. Standard communication about climate
change must not ignore these biases, and will likely be
ineffective if simply assuming a passive, blank-slate audi-
ence (Scheufele, 2014; Druckman & McGrath, 2019; Akin
& Landrum, 2017). Several studies suggest that effective
and motivating climate communication requires transmis-
sion to be shaped based on underlying values, mental and
cultural models of the audience and include practical, viable,
accessible, and attractive solutions to address it (Carpenter,
2019; Iyengar & Massey, 2019).
Our goal is to make climate communication more effective
with a recommendation system informed by personal values
and powered by climate change concepts mined from cur-
rent, reputable, and truthful climate news articles. Inspired
by framing theory (Chong & Druckman, 2007), the system
aims to present each user with climate change impacts and
solutions that are most relevant and motivational based on
that user’s personal values. To achieve this, the system must
a) access a knowledge base of climate change impacts and
solutions b) be provided a user’s motivational proﬁle, and c)
rank the climate concepts based on the user’s proﬁle. Fig-
ure 1 shows the outline of the proposed recommendation
system.
Figure 1. Effective climate communications using ClimateKB and
relevance characteristics from a user’s proﬁle.
The schema for solutions in the knowledge base relies on
having impacts standardized, therefore we focus our work
(and this proposal) on curating impacts as cause-effect con-
cepts before deﬁning a climate solutions schema. Tradition-
ally, domain experts would curate the knowledge base with
these concepts from a set of climate science articles. How-
ever, manual curation is hard to scale and automatic curation
techniques fail to generalize well to new domains (AuerPowering Effective Climate Communication with a Climate Knowledge Base
et al., 2007; Etzioni et al., 2008; Mintz et al., 2009). In this
work, we build a novel knowledge discovery system to build
a climate knowledge base (ClimateKB) semi-automatically
from the articles. Additionally, the climate concepts in Cli-
mateKB are linked to motivational reference characteristics
by domain experts since it is hard to mine these correlations
in the absence of user interaction information. Lastly, we
obtain a user motivational proﬁle using a questionnaire and
rank the concepts in ClimateKB based on the user’s proﬁle.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst initiative to
build a ClimateKB and a climate recommendation system
and revisits open research challenges in these problems.
To summarize, our main contributions are: (1) a knowl-
edge base, ClimateKB, that contains causes and effects of
climate change, (2) a knowledge discovery system for popu-
lating ClimateKB semi-automatically from text, and (3) a
recommendation system powered by ClimateKB. Since Cli-
mateKB has many more potential downstream applications
such as fact-checking and retrieval, we will freely release
it in the easily accessible Web Ontology Language (OWL)
format.
2. Climate Knowledge Discovery System
Figure 2 shows the overview of our knowledge discovery
system. Given a corpus of trusted climate articles, the sys-
tem ﬁrst identiﬁes sentences describing cause-effect rela-
tionships about climate change. It then ﬁnds entity mentions,
thecause and the effect , from each causal sentence. It then
canonicalizes the entity mentions and veriﬁes the climate
facts before populating the ClimateKB.
Figure 2. Knowledge discovery pipeline with 3 key components:
causal sentence detection, entity extraction, and canonicalization.
2.1. ClimateKB
We ﬁrst describe the data model (Figure 3) of ClimateKB.
We focus on sentences in climate articles to ﬁnd cause-effect
relationships. An entity mention is a reference to a climate
entity, such as the phrase "warming ocean" in the exam-
ple sentence. A climate entity is a real-world concept relat-
ing to climate science (e.g., "sea level rise" ), social
science (e.g., "increased conflict events" ), etc.
In order to accurately represent information about climate
change, we model each mention as a tuple of the form(state;base;unit). For instance, simply extracting "ocean"
or"sea" as the entity will lead to erroneous facts in the KB.
We, therefore, additionally extract the associated state of
change and the unit of measurement. Note that the vastness
of entities in the domain makes ClimateKB unique from
other general-purpose KBs about real-world entities (e.g.,
person, location) or concepts (e.g., drug names).
Figure 3. Data Model of ClimateKB
2.2. Data Collection
We focus on news articles to build the ClimateKB and power
the recommendation system. Unlike scientiﬁc articles that
tend to contain complicated jargon, news articles are easy
for users and domain experts to understand. Additionally,
well-reputed news sources often cite scientiﬁc articles and
summarize their key information more coherently. To build
a corpus of reliable climate articles, we manually aggregated
popular, reputed, and relevant news articles over a period of
one year. Our ﬁnal corpus has about 800 articles on a broad
diversity of climate change issues including wildﬁres, coral
bleaching, and extreme weather.
2.3. Causality Detection
The system next has to ﬁnd causal sentences from the cli-
mate articles. While transformer-based models (Devlin
et al., 2019) have shown state-of-the-art performance on
the task (Khetan et al., 2021), their performance is known
to deteriorate substantially on out-of-domain datasets. To
boost the performance, we ﬁrst adapt the model to our do-
main by further pre-training BERT on climate news articles,
scientiﬁc papers, IPCC reports, and books written for the
public by climatologists. We refer to the domain-adapted
model as ClimateBERT. Next, we ﬁne-tune ClimateBERT
for causality-detection using SemEval2007 (Girju et al.,
2010) and SemEval2010 (Hendrickx et al., 2019) bench-
marks. On a test set of 600 sentences curated by domain
experts from climate articles, the resulting model achieves
90% precision and 28% recall. Although the performance
is passable for the downstream tasks, further improvements
require techniques for robust domain adaptation and ﬁne-Powering Effective Climate Communication with a Climate Knowledge Base
tuning with limited data.
2.4. Entity Extraction and Canonicalization
ClimateKB entities are complex and typically have a base, a
state, and a unit. The base refers to the core climate or social
concept (e.g, wind, ocean, suicide), the unit refers to the
measurable aspect of the base (e.g, events, frequency, level),
and the state describe the change in the unit (e.g., increasing,
warming). Since these entities are domain speciﬁc and
complex, off-the-shelf named entity recognition models
cannot be directly used.
End-to-end neural models (Jie & Lu, 2019) and pre-trained
language models (Devlin et al., 2019) have state-of-the-
art NER performance. However, ﬁne-tuning these models
requires high-quality annotated data. Our initial attempts
to curate training data for entity extraction reveal several
challenges, including ambiguity in labels, the presence of
implicit entities, and the use of anaphora. Some of these
challenges are illustrated in Example 1.
Example 1 E1: In the sentence, “warmer temperatures
lead to ... ” , the entity "air" is implied.
E2: In the sentence, “climate pressures can adversely im-
pact resource availability ... ” , the token "pressure" can
be a base or unit.
E2: In the sentence, “this can trigger a chain of ... ” , the
token "this" refers to an entity from the previous sentence.
Annotators who are not careful or lack background knowl-
edge can potentially make label mistakes, which can nega-
tively impact model training. This opens up new research
avenues for developing novel frameworks that can handle
mistakes in the training data and/or can help guide the anno-
tators so they make fewer mistakes.
3. ClimateKB-based recommendations
Our goal is to use ClimateKB to catalog climate change
impacts and solutions and recommend climate information
that best motivates users to take action. Due to the novelty
of the task, our proposed system proﬁles the user explicitly
based on researched reference characteristics and leverages
the manually curated associations of these characteristics to
entities in the ClimateKB.
For reference characteristics, we use the personal values
framework from Schwartz’s theory of basic human val-
ues (Schwartz, 2012; Sagiv et al., 2017). Following prior
work (Ding & Pan, 2016; op den Akker et al., 2015;
Leuzinger et al., 2019), we focus on the following 10 per-
sonal values vi: conformity, tradition, benevolence, univer-
salism, self-direction, stimulation, stimulation, hedonism,
achievement, power, and security. For obtaining a user’spersonal values, we used a slightly modiﬁed version of
the Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ)(Schwartz, 2003).
Speciﬁcally, we modiﬁed the ultra short 10 question version
(Sandy et al., 2017) to refer directly to users instead of re-
questing that users compare themselves to someone of the
same gender. Each question assesses a different personal
value and uses a 6-point Likert scale (Joshi et al., 2015) with
values from ”strongly disagree” to ”strongly agree”.
Example 2 “decrease in population of moose available to
hunt”
Positive association: power ,stimulation ,hedonism
Negative association: universalism
Neutral association with remaining values
Next, the entities in the ClimateKB must be linked to the
10 personal value characteristics. To ensure high quality as-
sociations, we ask domain experts to assign an association:
positive, negative, or neutral, to each entity applicable in the
KB. Example 2 shows a climate entity phrase and its associ-
ations to different characteristics of personal values. More
formally, for a personal value vithey assign an association
score avi, where aviis1if the association is positive,  1if
the association is negative and 0if the association is neutral.
Lastly, we compute the relevance of a climate entity to a user.
Note the scoring method proposed is for proof-of-concept
and is simple. Let uviindicate the positive, centered, and
scaled Likert score of a personal value viobtained from a
user’s responses to the questionnaire. Given a climate entity
e, letae
viindicate the different associations of the entity.
The relevance Seof climate entity eto the user then can be
computed by:
Se=10X
n=1uviae
vi
The recommendation system could be improved to use more
sophisticated measures that learn from user interactions in
the app. More reﬁned and sophisticated versions of our
proposed motivation scoring and recommendation system
are likely to exist, and could be evaluated by comparing
each to actual user’s behavior, preferences, and psychology.
4. Future Outlook
In the coming years, we expect climate change to worsen.
Consequently, there will be more news coverage around
those impacts and more need for climate action. This re-
search will help us build a pipeline that expands the Cli-
mateKB in a scalable manner. This research also builds
the foundation for us to effectively capture and add to the
ClimateKB climate change adaptations and solutions, even
as more are developed. Expanding ClimateKB will bol-
ster our recommendation system, allowing it to motivate a
more diverse set of people and generate more conversationPowering Effective Climate Communication with a Climate Knowledge Base
around climate change. Since our work is freely available,
we hope others can ﬁnd additional and novel applications of
ClimateKB and other models we provide.
