Abstract
This study explores the application of diffusion models in the field of typhoons,
predicting multiple ERA5 meteorological variables simultaneously from Digital
Typhoon satellite images. The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an
area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional
Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest
that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological
data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately
7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM
recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6%
improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation
purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality
meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this
analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of
severe weather events on vulnerable regions. Code accessible at https://github.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have increased due to the
impacts of global climate change. In particular, typhoons which are one of the types of tropical
cyclones (TCs) get notable attention because of the harm they cause to both the natural environment
as well as human societies. Taiwan, one of the major economic hubs and populous regions in the Asia,
is particularly significant due to its high vulnerability to typhoons [ 1], making it an excellent focus
region for this project.With the rapid development of Machine Learning, the typhoon forecasting
can be done by numerous methods. Rita et al. [ 2] pioneered the use of artificial neural networks
to analyze satellite image data, which marked the first application of deep learning techniques in
typhoon trajectory forecasting. Rüttgers et al. [ 3] were the first to utilise satellite images and a
generative adversarial network (GAN) to successfully predict both the center coordinates of typhoons
and the future shape of cloud structures around typhoons. Moreover, diffusion models have been used
for predicting tropical cyclones [ 4]. DYffusion [ 5] was one of the improved diffusion models that
introduced a time-conditional interpolator and a predictor network to make a multi-step probability
prediction. Building on these advancements, this project uses Conditional Denoising Diffusion
Probability Models (CDDPM) [ 6] to predict multiple ERA5 reanalysis variables simultaneously,
Published as a workshop paper at "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", NeurIPS 2024using Digital Typhoon (DT) [ 7] images as conditional inputs. CDDPM has been successfully used in
remote sensing previously [8–11]
The study contributions to the current literature can be summarised as follows:
1.A customised typhoon dataset is created, facilitating the matching of DT and ERA5 reanal-
ysis data for any given region, allowing more accurate forecasting models across various
regions for the future study.
2.We successfully demonstrate CDDPM to consistently outperform other consistently outper-
formed other three models across multiple reanalysis variables with the highest PSNR and
SSIM scores and the lowest FID and LPIPS score.
3.As a result we also demonstrate the ability to generate additional high-quality reanalysis data
from satellite images, which can be used both for forecasting and to fill in gaps in existing
reanalysis datasets.
2 Data
2.1 Datasets
•ERA5 [ 12] is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate from 1940
onwards provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).
In this project, this dataset is used as the model input data and the variables used are
the u-component of wind (u10), v-component of wind (v10), surface pressure (sp), and
temperature at 2 meters (t2m) within the latitude and longitude range of 116.0794 -126.0794
and18.9037 -28.90374 , respectively, covering an area around Taiwan ( ±5◦).
•Digital Typhoon Dataset [ 7] is the largest typhoon satellite image dataset covering the
Western North Pacific region from 1978 to 2022, with a high resolution of 5 km and a
temporal resolution of 1 hour. As this project focuses on the area around Taiwan, 129
typhoons filtered out from original collection is used as the target dataset.
2.2 Data Processing
1.Region Selection and Data Extraction : Selected Taiwan region from 18.9037◦Nto
28.9037◦Nand116.0794◦Eto126.0794◦E. Extracted relevant typhoon data and cropped it
to ensure that the selected region of interest remains fixed.
2.Data Cleaning, Alignment, and Normalisation : Cleaned the datasets by removing errors
and inconsistencies. Synchronised Digital Typhoon and ERA5 data to ensure consistent use
in model training and inference. Standardised each variable by normalising the data to a
range of [0, 1], ensuring consistent scaling across all input features.
3.Data Augmentation and Train-Test Split : Applied augmentation techniques such as
random noise addition, Gaussian smoothing, and contrast adjustment to improve the model’s
generalisation capability. Divided the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing,
with augmentation applied to the training data.
3 Methodology
3.1 Training
In this project, the forward diffusion process involves gradually transforming the ERA5 meteorologi-
cal data into pure noise by incrementally adding Gaussian noise to the input ERA5 variables (u10,
v10, sp, and t2m) over Ttime steps. Each step slightly degrades the data by blending it with a small
amount of noise, eventually resulting in a nearly uniform noise distribution. This noisy data serves as
the basis for training the model to reverse the process.
The reverse diffusion process aims to reconstruct the original clean reanalysis data (ERA5) from
the noisy observations generated during the forward process. In the context of CDDPM, the reverse
process is parameterised by a neural network pθ. The network takes as input the conditional data x
(Digital Typhoon data), the noisy observation y(Noisy ERA5), the noise level γ, and predicts the
2noise component ϵ. The goal is made to to minimize the difference between the predicted and true
noise, thereby learning to effectively reverse the diffusion process.
Figure 1: CDDPM workflow: y0represents ERA5, and xrepresents the DT satellite image. In
forward diffusion, noise is added iteratively to y0. In reverse diffusion, the model denoises from yT
back to y0, conditioned on x.
3.2 Inference
During inference, the trained model uses the DT data xas a condition to iteratively refine the
noisy data yTsampled from a normal distribution, gradually denoising it to generate clean ERA5
meteorological data. The process involves generating noisy versions of the ERA5 variables and
iteratively refining these predictions by removing the noise using the learned reverse diffusion steps.
The inference process can be summarised as follows:
1.Initialise with Noise : Start with a sample of pure Gaussian noise, yT, which serves as the
initial noisy input.
2.Iterative Denoising : For each time step tfrom Tto1:
•Use the model to predict the denoised data yt−1from the current noisy data ytand the
conditional input x.
• Ift >1, sample noise z∼ N (0, I); otherwise, set z= 0.
• Compute the next step yt−1using the predicted mean and variance.
3.Final Prediction : The final output y0is the clean ERA5 meteorological data reconstructed
from the noisy input, conditioned on the DT data.
4 Results
4.1 Magnitude Prediction
The magnitude of wind M(ms−1) is a critical metric for understanding the overall wind speed and
direction, and is computed as the Euclidean norm of the two wind components, u10 and v10, defined
asM=p
u2
10+v2
10. Typhoon Muifa was a significant typhoon that impacted the Western North
Pacific region in September 2022 and Fig. 2 depicts the prediction of our models on an satellite image
of this event. Clearly, CDDPM presents the closest prediction to the ground truth.
4.2 Performance Metrics
When considering the overall performance across all variables, CDDPM emerges as the most reliable
and effective model. It consistently achieves the highest PSNR and SSIM values, along with the
lowest KL-Div, RMSE, FID and LPIPS, making it the top choice for applications requiring precise

and realistic predictions. SENet and CNN also found to perform well, also making it a strong
candidate for applications.
5 Conclusion
This study evaluates the effectiveness of different machine learning models, including CNN, SENet,
and CDDPM. They predict multiple meteorological variables simultaneously using satellite images,
with a focus on the region surrounding Taiwan. Overall, CDDPM proved to be the most reliable for
meteorological forecasting by evaluating performance metrics and magnitude prediction.
Future work would include testing the models across different geographical regions and weather
phenomena to validate their generalisability and robustness. Incorporating temporal dynamics by
using time series data can improve predictions of how meteorological variables evolve, particularly
in rapidly changing systems like typhoons. Additionally, exploring multimodal models by integrating
diverse data types, such as radar could enhance the robustness and accuracy of predictions.

5Appendix A Methodology of other models
A.1 CNN
Figure A.1: Structure of Conditional Convolution Neural Networks
The proposed CNN architecture processes a single-channel satellite image from the Digital Typhoon
dataset by replicating it into a four-channel input. This aligns the image with the four ERA5
meteorological variables used in training: u10 (zonal wind), v10 (meridional wind), sp (surface
pressure), and t2m (2-meter temperature). Replicated four-channel input image is processed through
the four residual blocks. Each block transforms the input feature maps while preserving the spatial
dimensions. After the residual blocks, the feature maps are passed through the four image upsample
layers, each of which increases the spatial dimensions until the output matches the original input size.
A.2 SENet
Since this project involves a multi-task scenario with four channels, each representing a distinct
meteorological variable, SENet is chosen due to its ability to model the interdependencies between
channels effectively. The SENet architecture builds upon the baseline CNN by integrating Squeeze-
and-Excitation (SE) blocks within each residual block. It allows the network to capture more intricate
channel-wise dependencies, improving the overall feature representation.

B.1 Visual Result
The figure B.2 shows example results for four different models: CNN, SENet, DDPM, and CDDPM.
The predicted meteorological data for four variables were compared: u-component wind (u10),
v-component wind (v10), surface pressure (sp), and temperature at 2 meters (t2m).
B.2 Pixel Difference
The pixel difference metric quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted and actual pixel values
in the generated meteorological data.

Based on Table B.1 shown above, CNN has the lowest mismatch overall, while SENet and CDDPM
also work well. However, CDDPM stands out in performance metrics but has a higher pixel difference,

which can be because of small but numerous local errors, leading to a higher overall pixel difference.
These discrepancies may occur because the model’s loss function prioritises minimising the noise
during the reverse diffusion process. The primary goal of this process is to accurately recover the
overall structure and distribution of the original data rather than focusing on precise pixel-by-pixel
reconstruction.
