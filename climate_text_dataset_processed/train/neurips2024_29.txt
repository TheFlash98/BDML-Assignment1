Abstract
Ground-based snow depth measurements are often realized using ultrasonic or laser
technologies, which by their nature measure the height of any underlying object,
whether it is snow or vegetation in snow-free periods. We propose a machine
learning approach to the automated classification of snow depth measurements
into a snow cover class and a class corresponding to everything else, which takes
into account both the temporal context and the dependencies between snow depth
and other sensor measurements. Through a series of experiments we demonstrate
that our approach simplifies the detection of seasonal snowmelt and corresponding
onset of plant growth, which we used to assess climate-change related phenological
shifts in otherwise rather poorly monitored high alpine regions.
1 Introduction
An excellent way to assess the effects of global warming on organisms is through phenology, which
studies the timing and recurring patterns of natural events. Long-term studies have shown that the
spring phenology of plants has advanced over the last decades [ 4,7,19,23,25,20]. These findings
have led to the establishment of phenological monitoring networks, which are, however, mostly
situated in areas below the treeline. Besides evidence from satellite observations [ 25], field evidence
of phenological shifts in high alpine regions is scarce due to the high costs and the labor involved.
In seasonally snow-covered regions, snowmelt and spring temperatures are the most significant
phenological cues that initiate plant growth [ 6,8,9,22,26,12]. The length of the snow-covered
season in the Eureopean Alps has receded in the 20thcentury with a significant shift in the timing
of snowmelt, particularly below the treeline [ 10,18,21,24]. A good proxy for high alpine regions,
demonstrating corresponding snowmelt trends, is the climatological station located at Weissfluhjoch
(Alpine range in Switzerland) (2540 m a.s.l.) [ 17], which suggests that the advancement of snowmelt
timing is most likely transferable to higher elevations as well.
We propose to mitigate the lack of evidence above the treeline with the use of automated weather
station (AWS) data from the Swiss Intercantonal Measurement and Information System (IMIS) [ 14].
IMIS employs ultrasonic sensors to measure snow height, which only measure the distance from the
sensor to the underlying object, whether it is snow or vegetation. The previous attempts to disentangle
snow measurements from the rest were based on thresholding [ 2], which is generally cumbersome to
transfer to new stations, and random forests [ 3], which however cannot explicitly model the temporal

snow or vegetation.
In this work, we instead approach this binary classification problem using a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) [ 13] that explicitly accounts for the temporal relationships between different points
in time series data. This accurate classification of snow height measurements allows us to track
snowmelt and the start of plant growth over a climate relevant period (1998-2023), showing evidence
of phenological shifts in high alpine regions – an excellent indicator of climate change [7].

model development. Yellow squares are the stations that have been used for training (14 stations) and
red triangles indicate stations used for testing (6 stations). Colours indicate elevation in m a.s.l.
2 Data
We used snow height data from the IMIS, a network of 132 AWS (as of May 2024) focused on snow
measurements that are distributed throughout the Swiss Alps and the Jura region (see Figure 1),
mostly located above 2000 m a.s.l. The stations acquire snow height and meteorological data regularly
in 30 minute intervals. Manual exploration showed that the following sensor measurements are key in
disentangling snow from soil and vegetation measurements: snow height (HS), air temperature (TA),
snow surface temperature (TSS), ground temperature (TG) and reflected short-wave solar radiation
(RSWR).
Snow/no-snow dataset For model development and validation, we prepared a dataset with reliable
ground truth information. A subset of 20 stations (see Figure 1 and Appendix A) which span different
regions and elevations were selected and manually annotated with two-class ground truth information
regarding snow height data into snow andno snow (e.g. vegetation, soil, rocks, etc.).
3 Methodology
The backbone of our model is a 4-layer TCN [ 13] architecture as shown in Figure 2, which has
4-dimensional time series with 48 time steps as the input. The number of layers and filter sizes were
selected so that the output representation of the last point in the input time series is an aggregation
of all previous time steps. This representation is fed to an MLP classifier, which first produces a
series representation and then uses this representation to produce output class probabilities. Due to
the properties of our dataset, we opt for the so-called focal loss [ 15], which allows the model to focus
2and train preferentially on hard examples while down-weighting the simple cases throughout the
training process.
Figure 2: Structure of the input data and architecture of the modified TCN employed. Each dilated 1D
conv block has filters described in the format ( input_features ×output_features @kernel_size ). The
composition of each MLP is described as ( input_features ,hidden_features_1 , . . . , output_features ).
Experimental setup. We ran training for a maximum of 300 epochs, feeding the model with a
batch of 64 samples in each iteration. We allowed for the possibility of early stopping if the validation
loss has not improved for more than 50 epochs. The optimization process was governed by the
AdamW [ 16] optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10−3. The learning rate was subject to step
decay with factor 0.1, three times, after 50, 100 and 150 epochs.
We took 14 stations from our dataset for training and use a 90/10 split with a fixed random seed to
obtain the training and validation set. The remaining 6 stations (SLF2, SHE2, KLO2, TRU2, WFJ2,
STN2) were used solely for performance evaluation purposes.
Phenological analyses. For plant phenological analyses, the 30min interval measurements of TA,
TG and HS measurements classified using our TCN were aggregated to daily medians. Snowmelt was
defined as the first day following the longest continuous winter snow cover, while snow-in marks the
first day of the continuous snow cover in fall. Summer or vegetation season ground temperatures are
determined as the median temperatures between meltout and snow-in. Spring temperature is defined
as the median temperature from snow-out until the vegetation growth onset. Of the 132 AWS stations,
124 stations between 1600 and 2950m yielded sufficient data for snowmelt and temperature trends,
with a mean coverage of 22 years per station. To extract the plant growth signal, days corresponding
to HS signal classified as snow during the vegetation period were removed. We fitted a logistic
curve [ 11] to the growth signal. Growing years with a poor fit (R<0.75) were excluded from the
analysis, resulting in 40 stations between 1600 and 2700m with a mean coverage of 19 years for plant-
phenological analysis. We defined an ecologically meaningful Start of Growth based on the tangent
at the point of the maximum growth and the intersection with the x-axis [ 5] (details in Appendix C).
To model temporal shifts, we applied linear-mixed effect models [ 1] with a phenological or climatic
response variable, with “year” as a fixed effect and “station ID” as random effect.
4 Conclusions and Impact
We propose a new approach to classification of snow height measurements coming from AWS
stations. Results in Appendix D demonstrate the efficiency of the model in disentangling snow
height measurements during snowmelt and vegetation growth periods, predesposing it to be used
in vegetation phenology and snow climatology. Early analysis of the classified time series from
1998-2023 suggests the advance of the timing of snowmelt and strong warming across all AWS
stations. We additionally observe a shortening of the timelag between snowmelt and initiation of
plant growth, indicating a warming-driven phenological advancement at a large subset of AWS
stations suited for tracking plant growth. Our preliminary vegetation phenology study highlights the
importance of long-term monitoring and automated machine learning approaches in understanding
climate-induced phenological shifts, with implications for ecosystem dynamics in remote alpine
regions (see also Appendix D.

5A Snow/No-Snow Dataset
For model development and validation, we prepared a dataset with reliable ground truth information,
which resulted in a new publicly available dataset1. Manually annotating snow height data is a tedious
process, and doing so for the whole IMIS network is intractable. Therefore, we identified a subset of
IMIS stations that we then manually annotated.
It should be mentioned that annotating historical data is problematic, as there is no way of checking
whether there really was snow at the station or not. This means that assessing the presence of snow
with the help of information from other sensors should be considered a best effort approach.

shows the snow cover flag and snow height; green rectangles mark periods with snow cover. (b)
focuses on the end of winter season 2009/2010 illustrating the behavior of TSS and RSWR dependent
on whether there is snow or not. (c) is the same as in (b) for the beginning of the winter season
2010/2011.
A subset of 20 stations (see Appendix A.1) which span different locations and elevations and vary in
underlying surface (e.g., vegetation, bare ground, glacier, etc.) were manually annotated with binary
two-class ground truth information regarding snow height data:
• Class 0 - snow - The surface is covered by snow.
• Class 1 - no snow - the surface is snow-free (e.g., vegetation, soil, rocks, etc.).
The stations annotated with ground-truth information are depicted in yellow and red in Figure 1.
An example of data annotation is shown in Figure 3, with two detailed views that emphasize the
differences in behavior of TSS and RSWR in the presence and absence of a snow cover. The selected
stations mostly contain data between 2000 and 2023 with a few exceptions for stations that have
been built later (BOR2, FLU2, LAG3, RNZ2 and SHE2; see Appendix A.1). The data is recorded
regularly at a 30-minute frequency.

This section provides a few concrete examples of snow height classification results. Figure 4 depicts
both examples where the model succeeds as well as some typical cases in which the model fails to
corrently classify the snow height signal.

Figure 4: Examples of classification results. The snow height signal is depicted in blue. The model
predictions in terms of probability (0 - 1) are shown in green. The dashed horizontal line denotes the
decision threshold for binary classification. The red-shaded areas show classification errors. (a) shows
a correct classification of summer vegetation growth. (b) is an example of early October snowfall
that has been classified partially correctly. (c) demonstrates the model’s capability to detect summer
snowfalls as well as scattered snowfalls at the beginning of winter. (d) is evidence that the model
does not always perform well, here making mistakes at the beginning of the next winter season.
8C Determination of start of growth
An example of fitted a logistic growth curve [ 11] to the clean plant growth measurements is shown in
Figure 5). T he start of plant growth is determined based on the tangent at the steepest point of the
logistic growth curve and its intersection with the x-axis [5].
Figure 5: An example of a logistic growth curve (in dark green) fitted to height measurements data
from TUJ2, in the vegetation season of year 2019. Snow height data corresponding to snow are
shown with blue stars, while plant signal is shown with green diamonds. The red cross marks the
snowmelt date, while the orange diamond marks the start of plant growth. The start of plant growth is
determined using the blue tangent line as described in [5].
9D Results
Classification performance. Figure 6 shows the classification performance of our model depending
on the time of the year. The model performs very well in April, May, June and July, which are
typically the months when snowmelt occurs (see also Appendix B), achieving an F1-score of 98% for
snow and 99% for snow-free ground. In addition, the model performs very well in classifying the no
snow class during the period of vegetation growth with an F1-score of 99.2%. These results suggest
that our model can be applied in phenological studies focusing on snowmelt and vegetation growth
shift analysis.
Figure 6: Performance of the model for each month of the year separately. The F1-score is shown
separately for the classification of snow (red line) and no snow (yellow line). The blue columns
indicate the distribution of snow samples, while the green columns indicate the distribution of the
no-snow samples.
Snowmelt timing and warming trends. Spring temperatures have risen by 1.95 °C±0.35°over the
study duration of 25 years with a rate of 0.78 °C/decade ( 95% CI: 0.42 – 1.13, p < 0.001). For AWS
stations with phenological data (n=40), the timing of snowmelt has not advanced significantly with
-0.28 days/decade ( 95% CI: -2.04 – 1.48, p = 0.755). Notably, when we look at all AWS stations (n=
126), we observe an advance of the snowmelt by -1.35 days/decade ( 95%: -2.15 – -0.55, p = 0.001)
amounting to -3.38 days ± 3.29 (see Figure 7(a)).
Phenological shifts. The Start of Growth was directly linked to the timing of snowmelt, consistent
with other studies [ 8,9], while late snowfall events shifted the start of growth towards later calendar
days. The Start of Growth, has changed by -2.41 days/decade ( 95% CI: -3.96 – -0.91, p = 0.002)
amounting to an advance of 6.03 days ±5.35. The unchanged timing of snowmelt at phenological
stations and the earlier Start of Growth results in a shortening of the time interval between snowmelt
and plant growth initiation; this lagtime has shortened by -2.06 days/decade ( 95% CI: -3.17 – -0.96,
p = 0.001) resulting in an overall shorting of 5.15 days ±2.85 (see Figure 7(b)). In 1998, the mean
lagtime between snow cover disappearance and growth onset was 21.1 days, while in 2023 this period
only lasts 16.3 days. Thus, alpine grasslands green up sooner after snowmelt.
