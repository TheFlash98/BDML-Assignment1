Abstract
With fires becoming increasingly frequent and severe across the
globe in recent years, understanding climate change’s role in fire
behavior is critical for quantifying current and future fire risk. How-
ever, global climate models typically simulate fire behavior at spatial
scales too coarse for local risk assessments. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach towards super-resolution (SR) enhancement of fire
risk exposure maps that incorporates not only 2000 to 2020 monthly
satellite observations of active fires but also local information on
land cover and temperature. Inspired by SR architectures, we pro-
pose an efficient deep learning model trained for SR on fire risk
exposure maps. We evaluate this model on resolution enhancement
and find it outperforms standard image interpolation techniques at
both 4x and 8x enhancement while having comparable performance
at 2x enhancement. We then demonstrate the generalizability of this
SR model over northern California and New South Wales, Australia.
We conclude with a discussion and application of our proposed
model to climate model simulations of fire risk in 2040 and 2100,
illustrating the potential for SR enhancement of fire risk maps from
the latest state-of-the-art climate models.
1 Introduction
Fires have become increasingly frequent and severe in recent years
with catastrophic impacts [ 1,2]. For example, the 2019-2020 Aus-
tralian megafires burned 24m acres of vegetation habitat [ 3] and
caused $1.4b US in air quality health impacts [ 1]. In California, 5 of
the state’s top 6 largest fires have occurred in 2020 alone, including
the first ever gigafire in modern history, defined as an individual fire
burning over 1m acres [ 4]. The 2020 California fires have already
burned over 4m acres, damaged or destroyed 10,000 structures, and
caused 31 fatalities at the time of writing [ 5]. Accordingly, to what
extent climate change has already impacted these fires, and whether
it will increase the magnitude and locations of fire risk moving for-
ward, is becoming crucially relevant in a range of sectors around
the globe [2, 6, 7].
Climate models provide an effective set of tools for quantify-
ing the impact of climate change on acute physical risks like fire
exposure [ 8]. These models help identify regions with high risk
and quantify the benefits of carbon emission reductions [ 9]. How-
ever, a major limitation of the climate models from the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) is that they have
spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 °to 2.5 °, complicating local or
asset-level analytics [ 8,10]. Enhancing spatial resolution on cli-
mate model fire exposure maps is therefore critical to making the
exposure maps indicative of asset-level risk for both historical and
forward-looking time horizons.
Figure 1: Application of 4x (0.4 °→0.1 °) SR FireSRnet to cli-
mate model simulations of fire exposure in two case study
regions: northern California, US (top) and New South Wales,
Australia (bottom).
One promising approach for resolution enhancement is image
super-resolution (SR), an area of model development gaining consid-
erable attention in the AI and computer vision research community
in recent years [ 11–13]. While leading SR models can generate in-
credibly photo-realistic images, research efforts typically focus on
real world visual imagery rather than geospatial datasets. However,
since 2017 two studies have aimed to bring recent advances in SR
modeling to the challenge of resolution enhancement of precipi-
tation data, including from climate models [ 14,15]. Those studies
indicate an exciting potential for SR in the geosciences, but to date
we are unaware of any such explorations beyond those with global
precipitation data.
Here we propose FireSRnet, a novel SR architecture operating
on a 3-channel geospatial dataset incorporating NASA satellite
fire data, local temperature, and local land cover burnability. We
compare FireSRnet performance at 2x, 4x, and 8x SR against a bench-
mark interpolation technique and validate model results with the
recent fires in California and Australia. Finally, we showcase how
FireSRnet can leverage CMIP6 climate model simulations of burned
area and temperature to enable more precise forward-looking esti-
mates of fire exposure (Fig. 1).
2 Dataset creation
Low-resolution (LR) geospatial data coded as input images to the
SR model architecture (Fig. 2) are derived from high-resolution (HR)
images having 3 channels corresponding to maps of fire counts,
temperature deviation from mean conditions, and a burnable landTristan Ballard and Gopal Erinjippurath
index. We use monthly HR data at 0.1 °(∼11 km) resolution from
March 2000 to August 2020 for both the continental US and Aus-
tralia. Due to data quality concerns, we do not include March to July
2020 and March to May 2020 for the US and Australia, respectively.
This results in a combined dataset of 240 images for the US and 243
images for Australia, each of size 256x584 pixels at HR.
2.1 NASA satellite fire counts
We use a monthly fire data product provided by the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA) based on imagery from
NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites [ 16]. NASA’s global fire data
product indicates the number of fires within a given 0.1 °pixel each
month and is available from March 2000 to present day.
2.2 Temperature deviation
Because we expect temperature to be a key indicator of fire risk
[17], we derived a monthly temperature deviation input channel
using temperature data for the US and Australia. For the US, we
use 4km resolution monthly temperature data provided by the
PRISM group [ 18]. For Australia, we use 5km resolution monthly
temperature data provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology
[19]. We expect temperature deviations, calculated by differencing
each monthly grid cell relative to its 2000-2019 mean temperature,
to be more informative than raw temperature since fires exhibit
significant seasonality [ 2,17]. We then downsampled resulting
temperature deviation maps to 0.1 °using bilinear interpolation.
2.3 Burnable land index
We developed a burnable land index input channel based on satellite-
derived land cover data with values ranging from 0 (low burnability)
to 1 (high burnability). The 300m resolution land cover dataset cre-
ated by the European Space Agency’s Land Cover Climate Change
Initiative assigns each pixel to one of 38 land cover classes based on
2015 satellite imagery [ 20]. To make these land cover classes more
scientifically relevant to the task of fire prediction, we binned each
of the classes as either burnable (e.g. forest land cover types) or
non-burnable (e.g. wetland). This binning was identical for the US
and Australia with the exception of grassland and shrubland classes,
which we classified as non-burnable and burnable for the US and
Australia, respectively, due to Australia having large bushfires that
are generally absent in the US for equivalent classes. We then down-
sampled the resulting binary map from 300m to 0.1 °using bilinear
interpolation, resulting in burnable land index values ranging from
0 to 1. We assume that the burnable land index is time-invariant
across years evaluated in this study, in part because land use change
at the spatial scales considered here has been relatively minimal
during the study period [21, 22].
2.4 CMIP6 climate model simulations
Climate models from leading international research centers are
standardized through CMIP6 [ 8,23]. Here we use the CMIP6 Cen-
tre National de Recherches Météorologiques Earth System Model
version 2.1 [ 24] simulations of monthly temperature and burned
area. To calculate the temperature deviation index, we use both his-
torical temperature simulations spanning 2000 to 2015 and future
simulations spanning 2016 to 2100 from the “Fossil-fueled Develop-
ment” SSP5-RCP8.5 carbon emissions scenario [ 25], the scenario

3 LR maps and outputting 1 SR map corresponding to fire
exposure.
most consistent with current carbon emissions. The CMIP6 model
employed here has a spatial resolution of 1.4 °, which is regridded
to the required LR input resolution.
3 FireSRnet architecture
Multiple approaches have been developed in the last few years for
SR on color imagery [ 11–13]. While the majority of such efforts
focus on imagery of natural and man made objects, two recent
efforts have applied SR algorithms to geospatial data, in particular
to precipitation estimates at 2x, 4x, 5x and 8x SR enhancement
[14, 15].
One important consideration for the design of our SR architec-
ture is data availability. We use monthly data from 2000 to 2016 for
training and model selection and 2017 to 2020 for out-of-sample
quantitative and qualitative assessment of model performance. Due
to the relatively small training dataset, we prioritized simple and
efficient, albeit still high performing, deep learning architectures.
Inspired by the approach described in [ 26], we arrived at a fire
super-resolution network (FireSRnet) deep learning architecture
summarized in Figure 2 for 4x SR. The architecture interleaves 2D
upsampling layers and 2D convolutional layers with variable size
filters. We use progressively smaller 2D filters of size 9x9, 5x5 and
3x3 sizes in the first, second and third 2D convolutional layers,
respectively with interleaved 2D 2x upsampling layers. The last
stage uses a 1x1 convolution to combine learnings from multiple
features maps to a single image at the target resolution. For the 2D
convolutional layers, we use ReLU activation with the same padding,
and for the upsampling layers we use bilinear interpolation. Owing
to the small number of layers in this network, we have a total of
7.7K trainable parameters that can be readily trained from scratch.
FireSRnet can be flexibly extended across different SR enhance-
ment scales, and we have so far experimented with 2x, 4x and 8x SR
(Figs. A1, A2). When going between SR scales, we use the same num-
ber of convolutional layers and trainable parameters. Lastly, since
the goal of SR on risk exposure maps is to preserve the accuracy
and fidelity of fire exposure, we use mean squared error throughout
as our loss function rather than a perceptual loss function.
Encouragingly, the layer 1 weights post-training result in a com-
bination of spot detectors, offset spot detectors, spot eliminators,
and sharpening filters, indicative of essential functions at the early
stages of the network to transform the LR inputs and enable down-
stream feature maps that are indicative of discriminating features
for fire detection (Fig. A3).

Figure 3: Evaluation of 4x (0.4 °→0.1 °) SR with out-of-sample fires in northern California (left) and New South Wales (right).
FireSRnet outperforms bicubic interpolation in both fire magnitudes and spatial distribution. Input maps are NASA satellite
fire counts [scaled 0-254], temperature deviation [ °C], and burnable land index [ranging from low (0) to high (1) burnability].
4 Quantitative model evaluation
For quantitative assessment of the performance of SR, we bench-
mark FireSRnet against bicubic interpolation by comparing the
target HR image from which the LR input image was derived with
the output SR or HR image calculated by FireSRnet or bicubic in-
terpolation, respectively.
We consider two aspects of model performance both relevant
to fire exposure modeling. First, since fire exposure is a continu-
ous value, we use R2and RMSE to indicate how we track model
prediction of the exposure magnitude as compared to the original
HR exposure map. Second, we quantify the model’s skill as a fire
detector by converting both the HR target image and the predicted
output images into binary fire maps. With these binary maps, we
considering classification error metrics of precision, F1 score, and
threat score [ 15]. We identify precision in particular as a key indi-
cator of SR performance as it inversely correlates to false-positive
detections. False-positive detections are the most common source
of error when upsampling sparse LR exposure maps because upsam-
pling diffuses exposure magnitude erroneously to neighborhood
pixels.
We find that FireSRnet outperforms bicubic interpolation for 4x
and 8x enhancement on all metrics (Table 1). For 2x enhancement,
FireSRnet outperforms bicubic interpolation for the metrics related
to exposure magnitude, whereas bicubic interpolation outperforms
FireSRnet on all three classification metrics (Table 1). This indicates
that for 2x fire exposure enhancement, the benefits of FireSRnet
over an interpolation alternative are less pronounced.
Next, we are interested in quantifying how generalizable FireS-
Rnet is to different global regions and thus different ecosystems,
climate conditions, and fire dynamics. To that end, we ran twoRMSE R2Precision F1 Threat Score

additional experiments for region specific models: 1) Retrained
on US data and validated out-of-sample on US data, and 2) Re-
trained on Australia data and validated out-of-sample Australia
data. Preliminary performance results (Table A1) between these
two experiments and the full model provides evidence that the
model could be generalized to regions beyond the US and Australia.
5 Qualitative model evaluation
We conduct case studies in northern California and New South
Wales, visually comparing observed HR fire count maps with cor-
responding maps derived from FireSRnet and bicubic interpolation
(Fig. 3). Because the case studies correspond to fire events in 2019
and 2020, neither were included in the training of FireSRnet. We fo-
cus here on the 4x SR maps, though the 2x and 8x SR maps indicate
similar qualitative performance (not shown).
We find that FireSRnet outperforms bicubic interpolation in
capturing both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the August
2020 California fires and the December 2019 New South Wales fires
(Fig. 3). FireSRnet accurately captures the magnitudes of fire counts,

Wales (right) for August 2040 and December 2100, respectively. Input image channels are CMIP6 burned area [%], CMIP6
temperature deviation [ °C], and a burnable land index [ranging from low (0) to high (1) burnability] and output is an single
channel CMIP6 burned area SR image.
whereas bicubic interpolation underestimates the magnitudes. This
suggests that bicubic interpolation underestimates fire exposure,
particularly in locations with the greatest fire activity. FireSRnet
also appears to better capture the boundaries of large fires in both
regions (Fig. 3), whereas bicubic interpolation results in overly
smoothed fire boundaries. The better delineation of fire boundaries
by FireSRnet is indicative of the deep learning model learning edge
behavior between fire and no fire pixels (Fig. A3).
Both FireSRnet and bicubic interpolation fail to capture fires with
small spatial footprints (single 0.1 °pixel size) since the signal from
these small fires tends to be lost when creating the downsampled
inputs (Fig. 3).
6 Super-resolution of future fire exposure
maps
One of the most promising applications of the FireSRnet modeling
framework (Fig. 2) is to enhance the resolution of fire exposure
maps simulated by global climate models. Compared with enhanc-
ing CMIP6 maps through bicubic interpolation, FireSRnet incorpo-
rates additional geoscience information on land cover and future
temperature when conducting the upsampling, suggesting it can
more accurately upsample CMIP6 fire exposure maps.
Here we display the potential of these SR fire exposure maps by
applying the 4x SR FireSRnet, trained and validated on observed fire
data, to CMIP6 simulations of future burned area and temperature
in August 2040 and December 2100 for northern California and
New South Wales, respectively (Fig. 4). For the burnable land index,
we use the same 2015-derived input map for all years rather than
modeling changes in land cover decades into the future.Quantitative assessment and verification of the output SR maps is,
of course, not possible for 2040 and 2100; nevertheless, the SR maps
appear qualitatively reasonable. Interestingly, the northern Cali-
fornia SR image suggests heightened risk in the Napa and Sonoma
areas (38.2 °, -122.5 °) in 2040 (Fig. 4), an area experiencing fires as of
October 2020. Meanwhile, the New South Wales SR image suggests
mostly low fire exposure in 2100, particularly towards the south.
While the observed HR fire count data employed to train FireSR-
net is not strictly equivalent to the CMIP6 burned area data product,
we argue that the pre-trained FireSRnet is suitable in this applica-
tion. First, NASA designed the fire count data for a range of research
applications, including validating global fire models [ 16]. Second,
qualitative assessment of the case study fire maps indicates that the
NASA fire counts correspond well to burned area footprints (Fig 3),
and qualitative assessment of the SR results (Fig. 4) further supports
the generalization of FireSRnet to future CMIP6 fire simulation.
7 Future directions
We see multiple avenues for building on the FireSRnet modeling
approach in the future. First, we intend to incorporate additional
global regions including Siberia and the Amazon rainforest in our
model training and assessments. Second, because FireSRnet can flex-
ibly integrate additional input channels, we could include drought
maps in the framework. Third, the rare event nature of the data
suggests the potential of a zero-inflated, two-stage SR model [ 27].
Last, while we focus here on single image SR, we see opportuni-
ties for improved performance using multi-temporal SR, which has
been applied to satellite imagery in the past [ 28] but never, to our
knowledge, to fire exposure maps.
