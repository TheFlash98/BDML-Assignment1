Abstract
Forest monitoring is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics, detecting
changes, and implementing effective conservation strategies. In this work, we
propose a novel approach for automated detection of human-induced changes in
woodlands using Echo State Networks (ESNs) and satellite imagery. Using ESNs
offers a promising solution for analyzing time-series data and identifying deviations
indicative of forest alterations, particularly those caused by human activities such as
deforestation and logging. The proposed experimental setup leverages satellite im-
agery to capture temporal variations in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI) and involves the training and evaluation of ESN models using extensive
datasets from Chile’s central region, encompassing diverse woodland environments
and human-induced disturbances. Our initial experiments demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of ESNs in predicting NDVI values and detecting deviations indicative
of human-related changes in woodlands, even in the presence of climate-induced
changes like drought and browning. Our work contributes to forest monitoring
by offering a scalable and efficient solution for automated change detection in
woodland environments. Integrating ESNs with satellite imagery analysis provides
valuable insights into human impacts on forest ecosystems, facilitating informed
decision-making for sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation.
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.1 Introduction
Monitoring forest ecosystems is crucial for addressing global change and mitigating ecosystem
degradation, as forests provide essential services such as water and carbon regulation, nutrient
cycling, air purification, biodiversity conservation, climate moderation, and recreational opportunities
(16;19;20;2;4;7;32). Deforestation, driven by urbanization and agricultural expansion, leads to
the destruction and fragmentation of habitats, disrupting vital ecological functions and threatening
biodiversity and sustainable land management ( 29;5;18;45). While the Amazon rainforest has
garnered significant attention, forests worldwide hold immense ecological, economic, and societal
value (35; 27; 10).
Natural disturbances such as fires and droughts also contribute to forest degradation, making it
challenging to differentiate between deforestation and other forms of degradation ( 9;26;36;33).
Effective landscape management and policy-making require robust monitoring systems that can
accurately detect these changes on a large scale, for which remote sensing provides a powerful tool.
The time series analysis of optical satellite imagery, combined with machine learning and statistical
techniques, has proven effective in detecting landscape changes ( 38;25;17;44). Notable examples
include the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm (CCDC) and Breaks for
Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) ( 46;43;24). Deep learning methods have further enhanced our
ability to analyze complex, multi-dimensional remote sensing data, with CNNs and RNNs particularly
successful in this domain (39; 34; 6).
However, the scalability of CNNs and RNNs remains challenging, particularly regarding compu-
tational demands and data requirements ( 15). Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), despite their
ability to model long-term temporal dependencies, face difficulties when adapting to changes in data
distribution, a critical factor in dynamic environments like forests ( 23;37;11). In this context, Echo
State Networks (ESNs), a type of RNN, offer significant advantages. ESNs can efficiently adapt to
new data and predict chaotic time dynamics. Their training process is faster and less prone to the
gradient problem compared to other RNNs, as only the readout layer is trained ( 13;14;21;22;28).
ESNs have been successfully applied in various domains, such as fault detection in industrial systems,
yet their application in forest change detection remains underexplored (3; 30).
Our research addresses this gap by developing an ESN-based system for detecting large-scale forest
changes, explicitly focusing on central Chile. This region has experienced severe droughts and fires
over the past decade, leading to significant tree mortality in a highly heterogeneous landscape of
forestry and agricultural mosaics, making it an ideal testing ground for this approach (9; 26).
2 Methods
2.1 Data selection, processing, and training
The study area covers approximately 78,000 km2in central Chile (latitudes from -36.5 °S to -32.2 ºS),
a region recognized as one of the global biodiversity hotspots ( 27). Local forests are confronted with
anthropogenic pressures such as urbanization, agricultural encroachment, and the introduction of non-
native plant species. In the last decade, the region has experienced extreme drought conditions that
cause widespread "browning" phenomena ( 9;26), and intense wildfire activity, further exacerbating
the stress on these vital ecosystems (36).
Our analysis is based on a Landsat multispectral dataset comprising 8,804 scenes captured between
January 2000 and June 2022 with the TM, ETM +, and OLI/TIRS sensors aboard Landsat 5, 7, 8,
and 9 satellites ( 41). For each pixel in the study region, we calculated the normalized difference
vegetation index (NDVI) ( 31) using the red and near-infrared bands in each collection and obtained
NDVI time series across all observed dates. To address the significant noise and missing values in
the raw NDVI signal, we developed a three-step “denoising algorithm" consisting of i)resampling
of the NDVI signal to bi-weekly intervals, ii) application of a standard deviation filter with linear
interpolation of missing values, and iii)a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (12).
For training of the change-detection algorithm, we identified areas that likely experienced different
forms of deforestation between 2016 and 2022 using records from the Global Forest Watch (GFW)
dataset ( 1). We relied on the visual interpretation of Google Earth Pro imagery for detailed demar-
cation of degraded polygons. In total, we selected 382 sites. Of these, 142 sites were linked to

human-driven deforestation, while 147 sites corresponded to other changes: 91 areas were affected by
the severe drought and vegetation “browning" in the summer of 2019–2020 ( 26), and 56 sites affected
by fires. Additionally, we selected 93 sites with stable time series where no changes occurred. We
used pixel-based data for our analyses, resulting in 23,053 individual pixel-based time series across
all sites. Further details on the dataset can be found in (8) and in A.3.
2.2 Echo state networks
We trained an Echo State Network (ESN) to predict the expected evolution of the NDVI signal for
each pixel. An ESN is a recurrent neural network (RNN) characterized by a reservoir of sparse,
randomly initialized, fixed weights ( 21), in which only the weights to output units are modified
for achieving the desired learning task( 13). An additional description of an ESN can be found
in Appendix A.1. We assume that the generative process underlying the NDVI signal is dynamic
since vegetation phenological cycles may vary over time. In such scenarios, an online learning
rule like Recursive Least’s Squares (RLS) is suitable ( 21). The ESN training instances consisted
of feature-target pairs derived from the NDVI signal. We defined a feature vector of 104 NDVI
values (approximately two years of data), with the values of week 105 designated as the target values.
This window was then shifted sequentially across the entire time series for each pixel, resulting in
104-dimensional NDVI feature vectors. This process, which we refer to as “signal featurization",
involves taking the previous two years for each signal value, so the first target value fed into the net
corresponds to the beginning of the third year of available NDVI signal. For training the ESN, we
randomly selected 30% of the stable and drought polygons, setting aside the remaining instances to
validate the fault detection procedure. Further details on the training procedure are given in A.2.
2.3 Change detection algorithm and model validation
To detect human-driven forest alterations, we adapted the fault detection scheme from ( 3) to analyze
changes in the NDVI time series for each pixel. First, the raw NDVI signal is de-noised and
transformed into feature-target pairs of 104 features. Then, the series is divided into two parts: the
training section, comprising NDVI values from the beginning of the satellite observations up to a
year before the final datum, and the hidden section, which consists of the last value of the signal.
The ESN is fine-tuned in the training section and used to predict the hidden section. We refer to this
prediction as the signal’s reference lower bound . Then, the hidden section of the signal is compared
to the lower bound using time-shifted predictions. This is achieved by taking a unit from the second
section, feeding it into the fine-tuned ESN, and predicting the remaining values. A pixel is classified
aschanged ifNconsecutive forecasted values of the time-shifted signal are lower than the lower
bound multiplied by a constant integer k. If no change is detected, the signal is shifted forward by
one unit, and the procedure is repeated until a change is detected or no remaining signal is left. We
used a voting mechanism to detect changes in entire polygons: a polygon is labeled as changed if the
percentage of pixels with a positive flag is greater than or equal to the threshold parameter th.
Appendix A.3 provides detailed information about the ESN dataset used. The data reserved for testing
the change detection algorithm encompassed the remaining 70% of the stable and drought polygons
(non change category), and the complete selection of the fire and drought polygons ( change category).
For each pixel, we used the change detection algorithm with thresholds th∈ {0.25,0.5,0.75},
Number of consecutive failures Nranging from 3to18and lower bound coefficient kranging from

details of this analysis can be found in appendix A.3.
33 Results
Table 1 shows the forecasting metrics obtained for both models. Results show that the non-feedback
model achieved superior performance, with all error metrics lower than the feedback model and with
a higher coefficient of determination.
Figure 1 shows two example polygons before and after the change event, with the algorithm’s

positives, while red dots indicate false positives for individual pixels.
Table 2 shows the classification metrics, where an accuracy of 0.708 was achieved. These metrics
highlight the model’s capacities for capturing true positives, with a recall of 0.823. It is also evident
that there is a tendency to incur false positives, with a precision of 0.619. Appendix A.4 has further
details on the classification metrics.
To further distinguish the results according to the type of disturbance, we analyzed the classification
metrics on four subsets of the polygons according to the type of non-change category (stable or
drought) and change category (logging or fire). Table 3 presents the detailed classification metrics,
and reveals an uneven performance across the subsets of polygons. The detection of logging and
fire events over stable polygons reached an accuracy of 0.926 and 0.871, respectively, but lower
detection scoers are obtained for polygons affected by drought(0.609 for logging and 0.478 for fire).
It is noticeable how precision scores rise considerably without the influence of drought-related false
positives, with a score of 0.979 for stable polygons and 0.950 for fire.
4 Discussion
The results presented here demonstrate the capabilities of ESNs for capturing forest dynamics and
detecting change events in forests. When detecting over stable polygons, ESNs had an overall
accuracy of 0.708, 0.926 for fires, and 0.871 for logging events. For polygons affected by drought,

the accuracy in change detection was comparatively lower, with a score of 0.609 for logging and
0.478 for fire events.
Our current work focuses on reducing the rate of false positives for drought polygons. One promising
venue for this matter is adjusting the change detection criteria. Hence, it considers the prediction
error of each particular pixel when determining the extent to which different predicted versus real
NDVI values consist of a change in the land cover. Possible ways to implement this are in the change
detection criteria defined by ( 46). Another improvement consists of evaluating the model to detect the
precise dates of the events. Doing so frames the problem as one of Change Point Detection (CPD),
where the objective is to determine time points where a time series changes its state( 42). Suitable
metrics that can be used for CPD are shown in (42).

A.1 Echo state networks
The reservoir activation vector x(n)is updated according to Equations 1 and 2. At each time step
n, the interim activation vector ex(n)is calculated by summing the input vector activation Winu(n)
and the prior activation Wx(n−1), then applying an activation function to the result. Optionally, a
feedback layer Wfbmay also be incorporated to include the previous output vector in the state vector
computation. The new activation vector x(n)is subsequently determined through a leaky integration
ofex(n)andx(n), with a leaking rate of α. Finally, the output vector y(n)is calculated through the
readout layer in Eq. 3.
ex(n) = tanh( Winu(n) +Wx(n−1) +Wfby(n−1)) (1)
x(n) = (1 −α)x(n−1) +αex(n) (2)
y(n) =Wout[u(n);x(n)] (3)
A.2 Training of the echo state network
For training the ESN, we randomly selected 30% of the stable and drought polygons, setting aside
the remaining instances for the fault detection procedure. The training dataset of the ESN used the
first ten years of instances of each pixel (520 feature-target pairs), roughly 50% of the ESN dataset,
and the remaining ten years of values were set aside for testing. We implemented the ESN using the
ResevoirPy python library ( 40). We set the reservoir size to 500 units, the spectral radius 0.9, and
the leaking rate to 0.5. We trained two ESN variations in the NDVI forecasting task: a plain-vanilla
ESN without feedback connections and an ESN with feedback connections. For validating the trained
models, we computed the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), the mean absolute error (MAE),
the mean squared error (MSE), and the coefficient of determination ( R2).

A.4 Supplemental Results
Figure 2 shows a grid of F1-scores for our change detection algorithm for all the parameter configura-
tions tested. It can be seen that the best parameters follow a diagonal pattern for all voting thresholds,
where lower values of kfavored lower values of N, and higher values of kfavored higher values of N.
The optimal model used the values th= 0.75,N= 3, andk= 0.81, which achieved an F1-score of
0.708.
9Figure 2: F1-scores for each parameter configuration tested. Darker sections of the grids indicate a
higher F1 score, meaning a better balance between Type I and Type II errors.
Table 6 shows the confusion matrix to classifications of the change detection procedure under the
optimal parameters. The results are detailed for each possible set of polygons according to the Non-
Change and Change categories. It can be seen that the algorithm achieved a high overall performance,
with false negatives of only 7.5%. There is a higher tendency for false positives, with a value of
21.6%, which can be explained mainly by mistakes detecting changes in polygons with drought.
