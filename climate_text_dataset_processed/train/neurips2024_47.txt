Abstract
PM2.5 pollution is a major health concern, especially in areas lacking robust real-
time monitoring and predictive capabilities. This study presents a comparative
analysis of three forecasting models—Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Net-
works (TCN)—to predict PM2.5 concentrations in four regions of Kigali, Rwanda.
Utilizing a dataset spanning from late 2020 to 2024, these models were trained on
historical air quality data obtained from sensors. Our findings reveal that the LSTM
model consistently outperforms both TCN and ARIMA models, delivering lower
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in predicting
PM2.5 levels. These results underscore the effectiveness of LSTM models in
providing more accurate air quality forecasts in complex temporal environments.
This research lays the groundwork for enhancing air quality monitoring and public
health strategies in Rwanda.
1 Introduction
Air pollution is a significant global concern [ 1] that impacts human health, the environment, and the
climate. It consists of various harmful substances [ 2], including gases, chemicals, and particulate mat-
ter, which are released into the atmosphere through human activities such as industrial processes and
vehicle emissions. Among the various pollutants, particulate matter (PM) is particularly concerning
due to its ability to remain suspended in the air for long periods and penetrate deep into the respiratory
system [ 3,4]. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller [ 5],
which are about 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair [ 3]. These fine particles originate
from various sources, both anthropogenic (residential heating, construction activities agricultural
practices) and natural (wildfires, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, sea spray) [ 6,7]. PM2.5 can be
easily inhaled and penetrate deep into the respiratory system, causing serious health issues such as
asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and premature death [ 5,8]. Additionally, high levels of
PM2.5 contribute to environmental issues like haze and reduced visibility, impacting both ecosystems
and climate [6, 4].
Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.In Rwanda, the relevance of studying PM2.5 levels is particularly significant due to the country’s
rapid urbanization and economic development [ 9,10,11]. As Rwanda continues to grow, the
potential for increased air pollution becomes more prominent, especially in urban centers like Kigali.
Understanding the sources, distribution, and concentration of PM2.5 in Rwanda is essential for
addressing public health concerns [ 12], as high levels of PM2.5 pose severe risks [ 6,3], particularly
for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions.
In this work, we present the use of three machine learning models to forecast the PM2.5 level in
different locations in Kigali, Rwanda using a data collected from Rwanda Environmental Management
Authority (REMA). Our analysis is based on average daily levels of PM2.5. The methods we have
utilized for the prediction are: Auto regressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA), Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN).

Air pollution, specifically fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), is a major concern in environmental
research due to its severe health effects. Predicting PM 2.5 levels is crucial for minimizing these
impacts, particularly in emerging countries like Rwanda, where air quality management is still
developing. This literature review examines previous studies on PM 2.5 prediction models, with a
focus on methodologies appropriate for Rwanda’s specific environmental conditions.
In the context of PM2.5 prediction, a variety of classical machine learning and deep learning models
have been employed, addressing different time scales such as hourly and daily. Classical methods
include linear regression, Support Vector Machine Regressor (SVM) [ 13], Random Forest [ 14], and
ARIMA models [ 15]. On the other hand, deep learning techniques like Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) have been explored for
their efficacy in handling time series data [ 16]. Despite the breadth of research on PM2.5 prediction
globally, there is a noticeable lack of studies focused specifically on Rwanda.
A study [ 17] analyzed PM2.5 trends across various stations in Kigali, including Gitega, Gacuriro,
Rebero, Kimihurura, Gikomero, Rusororo, Kiyovu, Mount Kigali, and Gikondo Mburabuturo. They
compared ARIMA, Neural Network, and Gaussian Process models using RMSE and MAE metrics.
Building on their approach, our work incorporates the statistical ARIMA model alongside two deep
learning methods, LSTM and TCN, aiming to develop a model that achieves better accuracy with
reduced error, using the same metrics for comparison.
3 Data and Methodology
3.1 Data Collection
The study uses air quality data from Kigali, Rwanda, collected from four monitoring stations:
Gikondo-Mburabuturo, Jali, Mont Kigali, and Rusororo. The dataset covers the period from 2020 to
2024 and includes hourly PM2.5 concentration measurements obtained from the Rwanda Environment
Management Authority (REMA).
Data preprocessing started with an initial inspection to understand its structure and contents. Some
columns were converted to datetime format for consistency and easier manipulation. New features
such as ’Date,’ ’Year,’ and ’Month’ were created to facilitate time series analysis, which helped
in identifying temporal patterns and trends in PM2.5 concentrations. The data was checked for
inconsistencies or missing values, which were handled to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
3.2 Methodology
3.2.1 ARIMA
The ARIMA model is a widely used statistical approach for time series forecasting. When working
with time series data, it’s crucial to determine whether the series is stationary or non-stationary. A
2stationary time series has a constant mean, constant variance, and constant autocorrelation over time.
If the series is stationary, we can use ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) models to predict
future values. ARMA combines two components: AutoRegressive (AR) with an order of p, and
Moving Average (MA) with an order of q. These components capture the relationships between the
data points as shown in the equation below.
Yt=α1Yt−1+α2Yt−2+· · ·+αpYt−p+ϵt (AR(p))
Yt=m1ϵt−1+m2ϵt−2+· · ·+mqϵt−q+ϵt (MA(q))
However, if the time series is non-stationary, we need to transform it by taking differences to
achieve stationarity before applying the ARMA model. This transformation is where the ARIMA
(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model comes into play. The "I" in ARIMA stands
for integration, which refers to the differencing step that makes the series stationary. The order of
differencing is denoted by d, and once the series is stationary, the AR and MA components are applied
as in ARMA to make predictions.
In our case, the ARIMA model was employed to forecast PM2.5 levels after confirming the series’
stationarity through differencing. We used an ARIMA configuration with parameters p=2,d=1, and
q=2, where pandqrepresent the orders of the AutoRegressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA)
components, respectively, and dindicates the number of differences applied to achieve stationarity.
The model was fit on the training data, which comprised the first 80% of the dataset, and predictions
were generated for the remaining 20% as the test data. The performance of the model was evaluated
using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which quantified the accuracy of the forecasts.
3.2.2 LSTM
LSTMs, or Long Short-Term Memory networks, are a type of recurrent neural network capable
of handling large sequential data by utilizing both past and current information to predict future
outcomes. Unlike traditional RNNs, which struggle with long-term dependencies due to issues like
vanishing gradients, LSTMs feature separate pathways for short-term and long-term memory. This
architecture enables them to maintain and update relevant information over extended sequences,
making them particularly effective in applications like time series forecasting where complex temporal
patterns are involved.
In our implementation, we use a bidirectional LSTM model to capture both past and future depen-
dencies in the time series data. The model consists of three bidirectional LSTM layers with 150
units each, followed by dense layers to enhance feature extraction. Dropout was applied to prevent
overfitting. For data preparation, sequences of 30 past observations were used to predict the next value.
The training set consisted of these sequences, while the target set contained the corresponding next
values in the time series. The final output layer predicts the target variable. The model was compiled
with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function and optimized using the Adam optimizer with
a learning rate of 1e-5. These values were selected optimally after running experiments aiming to
accurately model the complex temporal patterns in the data.
3.2.3 TCN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly associated with image processing tasks.
However, recent researches have demonstrated the effectiveness of Temporal Convolutional Networks
(TCNs) for sequence modeling and forecasting. TCNs use dilated, causal 1D convolutional layers
that maintain equal input and output sizes in univariate cases. The dilation in TCNs enables the model
to capture long-range dependencies by expanding the receptive field without increasing the number
of parameters or computation. Meanwhile, causal 1D convolutional layers ensure that predictions at
any given time step depend only on past and current data, preventing future data leakage. This makes
TCNs well-suited for tasks where temporal dependencies and forecasting are crucial.
3In our PM2.5 prediction task, we used a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture complex
temporal patterns in the data. The TCN model featured 16 filters with a kernel size of 3 and dilation
of [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32] to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Data preparation for the TCN
model involved creating sequences similar to the LSTM approach, where each sequence of 30 past
observations was used to forecast future PM2.5 levels. We applied layer normalization and a dropout
rate of 0.02 to prevent overfitting. The model was optimized with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
at a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.8, using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for loss and
Mean Squared Error (MSE) for evaluation, enabling accurate forecasting of PM2.5 levels.
4 Results and Discussion
The performance of ARIMA, LSTM, and TCN models was evaluated across four locations, with
metrics reported for both RMSE and MAE. As can be seen in Table 1, LSTM and TCN models
consistently outperform ARIMA across all locations, with LSTM generally achieving slightly better
results. TCN also performs well but shows some variability, with performance close to that of LSTM
in certain locations.
The results highlight variability in model performance across different sites, suggesting that effec-
tiveness may be influenced by location-specific factors and dataset size. Notably, the Jali site had
a shorter dataset period and a significant amount of missing values, which may have affected the
results. In general, our models show significant improvement over the existing model and the result
reported in the study [17], for similar datasets and regions.

45 Conclusion
Forecasting PM2.5 concentrations using machine learning algorithms has gained significant attention
in recent research, but efforts in the Sub-Saharan region remain limited. This study assessed
the performance of three forecasting models—ARIMA, LSTM, and TCN—in predicting PM2.5
levels at various sites in Kigali, Rwanda. Our findings indicate that the LSTM model consistently
outperforms the others, demonstrating superior capability in capturing temporal dependencies within
time series data, thus enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, the TCN model also showed strong
performance, underscoring its potential for time series data analysis. The methodology employed in
this study can be extended to predict other air pollutants in the region, providing valuable insights for
climate decision-makers and urban planners to implement effective environmental interventions.
6 Future Work
While it is important to notice that some of the models have performed better than some existing
models [ 17], there is still room for improvements. In future work, leveraging satellite imagery
in combination with Deep Learning models offers a good alternative for enhancing the prediction
accuracy of PM2.5 levels. For example, Sentinel images and particularly Sentinel 5P provide high-
resolution, multi-spectral data that can capture environmental variables and land cover characteristics
closely related to air quality [ 18]. Using that technique may be useful to model complex spatial
and temporal patterns of PM2.5 distribution more effectively. While most of them are not directly
related to PM2.5 levels, several studies have demonstrated the use of that combination for a better
environmental monitoring. There is this study [ 19] which estimated the Breezometer Air Quality
Index (BAQI) using 10,000 satellite images at resolution 1280 x 1280 across 57 cities and achieved an
accuracy of 72.70%. Another study [ 20] developed a Air Quality Network (AQNet), a multi-modal
model using satellite-derived data and other data such as population density and altitude to predict
the levels of three main pollutants - NO2, O3, and PM10. Building on these foundations, future
research could explore the fusion of satellite imagery with real-time ground-based measurements,
incorporating sophisticated Deep Learning models.
