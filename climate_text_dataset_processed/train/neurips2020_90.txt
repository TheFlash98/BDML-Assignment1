Abstract
With the advent of climate change, wildÔ¨Åres are becoming more frequent and severe
across several regions worldwide. To prevent and mitigate its effects, wildÔ¨Åre intel-
ligence plays a pivotal role, e.g.to monitor the evolution of wildÔ¨Åres and for early
detection in high-risk areas such as wildland-urban-interface regions. Recent works
have proposed deep learning solutions for Ô¨Åre detection tasks, however the current
limited databases prevent reliable real-world deployments. We propose the devel-
opment of expert-in-the-loop systems that combine the beneÔ¨Åts of semi-automated
data annotation with relevant domain knowledge expertise. Through this approach
we aim to improve the data curation process and contribute to the generation of
large-scale image databases for relevant wildÔ¨Åre tasks and empower the application
of machine learning techniques in wildÔ¨Åre intelligence in real scenarios.
1 Introduction
WildÔ¨Åres are a recurrent natural hazard on a global scale that has a brutal impact on the environment
and natural ecosystems, which can lead to disasters with dire impacts on communities [ 1]. As a result
of climate change, Ô¨Åre events are becoming more frequent and severe, with meteorological conditions
of high ignition propensity being more frequently met, leading to increased Ô¨Åre spotting, and rapid
spread. In addition, these conditions are veriÔ¨Åed over longer periods, extending Ô¨Åre seasons in several
regions worldwide.
To prevent and mitigate the devastating effects of wildÔ¨Åre events, it becomes urgent to detect Ô¨Åres in
an early stage and to monitor wildÔ¨Åres in near-real-time as the events unravel, providing enhanced
situational awareness for decision-making and operational teams. In that sense, wildÔ¨Åre intelligence
plays a pivotal role, especially for high-risk areas such as wildland-urban-interface regions [ 2] and
large-scale wildÔ¨Åres [ 3]. For these reasons, there is a current demand for improvements and increased
levels of automation in the stages of pre-Ô¨Åre event, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting, and aftermath.
In this context, the breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) can be an enabling technology towards
the integration of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence products in current decision support systems. More speciÔ¨Åcally,
related works have proposed ML solutions for image-based Ô¨Åre detection tasks [ 4,5], however the
quality and limited size of image databases available often do not offer generalization guarantees
for reliable deployments in real contexts [ 6]. Although transfer learning and data augmentation
techniques have been explored in related work, the limitations in interpretability and transparency of
black-box models prevent effectively Ô¨Åne-tuning these models to solve existing shortcomings [ 6].
The lack of large-scale databases for wildÔ¨Åre detection and monitoring tasks is a known hurdle in
developing machine learning algorithms with adequate generalization.

critical applications, the robustness and reliability of the models have yet to undergo signiÔ¨Åcant
developments. Conversely, this may be achieved through high-quality data curation, despite not alle-
viating black-box limitations, or through the exploration of algorithms with increased explainability,
Ô¨Åne-tuning ability and interpretability. However, both these scenarios call for the input of expert
knowledge to develop accurately annotated data, which is particularly nuanced in the Ô¨Åeld of wildÔ¨Åre
management and operations, and requires domain expertise as there is also high data uncertainty.
To address these issues, we propose the development of expert-in-the-loop systems that combine
the automation advantages provided by machine learning with the introduction of relevant domain
knowledge expertise. The main objective of the proposed approach is the development of semi-
automated software tools that can support data curation by wildÔ¨Åre experts. This solution can allow a
better handling of data uncertainty and improve the quality of data sources, with the ultimate objective
of enabling the development of large-scale databases for wildÔ¨Åre-related problems. More importantly
the expert-in-the-loop approach allows involving domain experts and end-users ( e.g., researchers and
public agencies) in the development procedure, thus improving the relevance of machine learning
applications developed for wildÔ¨Åre intelligence in real contexts.
2 Image-based WildÔ¨Åre Management Tasks
Image data for wildÔ¨Åre-related tasks can have a broad spectrum of characteristics and modalities
as these can be collected e.g., from satellites, aerial vehicles, watchtowers, or ground teams. The
latency associated with these data types also varies and consequently, so does its timescales of
application. From this plurality arises a great breadth of opportunities for ML approaches to deal
with high-dimensional data, but also a great challenge for data curation. Herein, we outline several
relevant tasks followed by a brief data description.
Tasks WildÔ¨Åre management involves four main stages: i)prevention, ii)preparedness, iii)response
andiv)recovery. The following tasks can extend to several of these stages and involve processing of
large amounts of image data, thus having a high potential interest and beneÔ¨Åt from the usage of ML.
Risk assessment concerning environmental conditions and risk mapping based on land use
and social patterns;
Vegetation management to reduce Ô¨Åre severity, e.g.fuel mapping, monitoring of fuel breaks,
or tracking of vegetation fuel moisture content;
WildÔ¨Åre detection and monitoring, e.g., early identiÔ¨Åcation of Ô¨Çames and smoke plume,
mapping of the Ô¨Årefront(s), early detection of spot Ô¨Åres and identiÔ¨Åcation of hot spots;
Post-event analyses, e.g., mapping burned areas, evaluation of possible subsequent cascading
effects, e.g., erosion risks, and air quality estimation based on remote sensing.
Data The evolving datasets being developed comprise multimodal image data, currently in the
visible and thermal infrared bands, including images captured from ground teams, watchtowers,
aircraft and high-altitude balloons, which are exempliÔ¨Åed in Fig. 1 (for visible range instances only).
The image samples comprise a diverse collection of situations, with most concerning real wildÔ¨Åre
events and Ô¨Åeld experimental burns. To create a balanced and robust set of data, factors that may
induce misclassiÔ¨Åcations are also included such as clouds, fog or sunsets, as well as Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting
vehicles, power lines and various types of operational teams.

23 Proposed Approach
The development of expert-in-the-loop systems aims to bridge the gap between machine learning
automation ( e.g. in classiÔ¨Åcation, segmentation, or detection tasks) and the inclusion of relevant
domain knowledge expertise, so that data curation is relevant for wildÔ¨Åre intelligence in real-world
scenarios and wildÔ¨Åre science research. Previous contributions in the literature have favored tech-
niques that are well-suited for real-time deployments despite having limitations in performance,
in lack of transparency and interpretability. However, those limitations hamper considerably the
reliability and acceptance of end-users of such techniques, hindering the deployment in safety-critical
applications in real contexts.
This novel approach in wildÔ¨Åre related applications leverages the potential of exploring machine
learning and computer vision, and intelligent systems methods that have not been particularly designed
for online computational performance (in terms of speed/energy) in real-time deployments, but are
rather accurate despite computationally heavy and/or time-consuming. To harness the advantages
of this approach, this project aims to design expert-in-the-loop systems and develop software tools
that can introduce domain knowledge into the data curation and task design processes. To that
end, this approach can be outlined as exempliÔ¨Åed in the diagram in Fig. 2. Domain expertise is
introduced in two stages through two feedback loops: 1) task deÔ¨Ånition/reÔ¨Ånement - where experts
deÔ¨Åne relevant tasks and reÔ¨Åne these based on the results of the data curation process (outer loop); and
2) expert validation and interpretation - where at the end of automated processing pipeline, experts
enable re-iteration and learning patterns on veriÔ¨Åed outputs (inner loop). Depending on the task at
hand, feature extraction, feature selection, detection and pixel-level segmentation techniques used
for semi-automated annotation can resort to several computer vision, machine learning and a broad
scope of intelligent systems approaches. Successful implementations of this approach should aim for
obtaining increasingly accurate Ô¨Åne-grained outputs validated with cohorts of experts, which shall be
quantiÔ¨Åed with relevant evaluation metrics for quantitative benchmarking.

The key beneÔ¨Åt of this data curation approach is to yield Ô¨Åne-grained annotated data sources for the
development of large-scale databases for wildÔ¨Åre-related problems. By being validated by domain
experts, it will also improve the relevance of subsequent machine learning applications developed
for end-users ( e.g.wildÔ¨Åre management, Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting and civil protection agencies, and researchers
working on wildÔ¨Åre-related topics).
4 Conclusion and Future Work
The solutions developed through the proposed approach will be an important stepping stone for
data curation and creating large-scale datasets for wildÔ¨Åre detection and monitoring. These datasets
will open opportunities for leveraging ML technologies in this context, as well as pave the way for
relevant multi-view data association [ 7] and autonomous robotics tasks in this domain [ 8]. ML along
with emerging technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles and cube-sat systems are important
enabling technologies for near-real-time wildÔ¨Åre intelligence, which will have an essential role in
decision support systems with crucial impacts in the safety of at risk populations and environment
protection.
3Broader Impact
Real-time early Ô¨Åre detection and monitoring systems can prevent the loss of natural ecosystems
responsible for climate regulation through carbon sequestration, can help to avoid the occurrence
of large burnt areas, and the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the integration, at different
timescales, of data-driven intelligent systems in decision support systems for Ô¨ÅreÔ¨Åghting and civil pro-
tection can contribute to mitigate the social, cultural, environmental and economic effects associated
with wildÔ¨Åres, contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
