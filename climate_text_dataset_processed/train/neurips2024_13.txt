Abstract
Encoding and predicting physical measurements such as temperature or carbon
dioxide is instrumental to many high-stakes challenges – including climate change.
Yet, all recent advances solely assess models’ performances at a global scale.
But while models’ predictions are improving on average over the entire globe ,
performances on sub-groups such as islands or coastal areas are left uncharted.
To ensure safe deployment of those models, we thus introduce FAIR-E ARTH , a
fine-grained evaluation suite made of diverse and high-resolution dataset. Our
findings are striking–current methods produce highly biased predictions towards
specific geospatial locations. The specifics of the biases vary based on the data
modality and hyper-parameters of the models. Hence, we hope that FAIR-E ARTH
will enable future research to design solutions aware of those per-group biases.
1 Introduction
Our planet exhibits phenomena that operate across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from
local microclimates with hourly fluctuations, to global climate patterns that evolve over decades.
Capturing those dynamics is crucial for climate change monitoring and mitigation. Existing methods
include observation-based networks on the ground and sea ( 18), satellite-based remote sensing
(21), and more recently, computer-based climate simulations ( 10). However, all aforementioned
approaches suffer from some combination of discretization error, modeling error, data inconsistency,
and resource-intensive inference ( 1). By being able to learn nonparametric models from arbitrarily
high-resolution, multi-modal data, AI–and in particular Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)
(20)–offer an attractive and efficient alternative. The use of INR to learn the underlying physical
dynamics of geospatial data has seen a rapid increase in interest ( 6). Such methods learn to encode
the underlying generative process and representation of the data through an implicit function mapping
coordinates to data realisations–through a Deep Neural Network (DNN) (11).
However, all recent INR advancements emerge from improving average test performances, i.e., by
assessing predictions’ quality over the entire Earth. This begs the following question:
How reliable are current state-of-the-art solution when looking at specific sub-groups such as coastal
land or islands?
As INRs are being deployed increasingly for climate monitoring, it is of utmost importance to
develop specialized evaluation suites to quantify the fairness of current solutions. This of course is
practically motivated: for tasks like natural disaster risk assessment where consequences are severe,
there is a natural emphasis on improving worst-case performance rather than average-case metrics
(15). To ensure that practitioners both in climate and AI research can better assess their model’s

rigorous evaluation of state-of-the-art INRs against FAIR-E ARTH , we obtain the following striking
observations:
1. “localized” groups such as coasts and islands are left behind (Fig. 6, Table 3)
2. global performance is negatively correlated to island performance (Fig. 10)
3. per-group performance can not be competitive on all sub-groups concurrently (Fig. 9).
TheFAIR-E ARTH dataset and the accompanying experiments described in this paper represent our
attempt to address these challenges head-on. By providing a common, open-source3playground for
researchers and practitioners, we aim to accelerate progress in tackling pressing environmental and
societal challenges.
2 Background
The (un)fair impact of solely focusing on improving average test performance has been observed
to be detrimental to sub-group performance within the context of natural image classification tasks
(3;16). However, to the best of our knowledge, no such assessment has been proposed for INR, and
in particular for INR on Earth observations. Prior to diving into the fairness assessment in Section 3,
we begin with some background on INRs.
Implicit Neural Representations. Throughout our study, we will focus on the latest state-of-the-art
INR model developed by ( 19). The model introduces a novel integration of SPHERICAL HARMONIC
location embeddings with SirenNets ( 20), demonstrating consistently superior performance over
earlier location encodings such as G RIDand T HEORY in various ablation studies (2; 17).
The crux of this procedure lies in decomposition of the underlying signal, e.g., land boundaries,
temperature, as continuous signals on the globe f: (λ, ϕ)7→R. Specifically, for well-behaved
functions, e.g., with exponential decay of their eigenvalues, the following decomposition can precisely
recover the original signal:
f(λ, ϕ) =∞X
l=0lX
m=−lwm
lYm
l(λ, ϕ), (1)
where Yis the class of spherical harmonic functions as depicted in Fig. 8, ware learnable scalar
weights, and landmare the degrees and orders of the basis functions Ym
l(in practice, we impose an
upper bound on l, effectively capping the representable frequency). Eq. (1) can easily be seen as a
“linear” network with weight w. INR then extends that formulation by enabling that weighting of
Ym
l(λ, ϕ)to be a nonlinear function (DNN) of landm; we direct the reader to Appendix A.1 for
further details and theoretical intuition as to why Eq. (1) may exhibit geospatial biases when dealing
with earth observations.
3 The FAIR-E ARTH Dataset
We now describe FAIR-E ARTH , our evaluation suite enabling localized performance and per-group
performance assessment of INRs. The fairness assessment of current SOTA solutions will be provided
in the following Section 4. This design of FAIR-E ARTH is mostly motivated by two core principles.
High-resolution monitoring. TheFAIR-E ARTH dataset employs a uniform 0.1◦x 0.1◦gridding of
the globe, yielding a consistent 1800 x 3600 map size for all variables. We leverage two modalities.
Land-ocean data: Based on ( 13), this component contains coarse signals like continental landmasses
while also providing high-resolution boundaries for fine-grained signals such as islands and coastlines.
Climate data: Derived from the GRACED2021 ( 8) and CHELSA ( 14) datasets, this component
provides an assortment of coarse and ultra-fine-grained signals, as well as high resolution along the
time dimension. This temporal granularity allows for analysis of both long-term climate trends and
short-term weather patterns.
Sub-group monitoring. We propose attributes and metadata including landmass size, coast distance,
and population density for each location hence enabling to disentangle the global prediction perfor-
mance into meaningful subgroups. To define binary thresholds for islands and coastlines, we provide
flexibility with adjustable thresholds. This feature allows researchers to fine-tune their analyses based

on specific definitions of islands or coastal zones, which can vary depending on the research question
or application domain. For the purposes of our analyses, islands are defined as landmasses with size
under 30,000sq. miles, encapsulating most of the “minor islands” as defined by (7).
4 Observed (Un)fairness of Existing Solutions
We now present a unified fairness assessment of current SOTA INRs. We recognize that climate
data are often confounded by outside factors, e.g., cloud cover or population based crowd-sourcing
(12). As our goal is to highlight the presence of structural biases in existing INRs, we will focus
our assessments on the land-ocean dataset which is noiseless. Details on training procedures can be
found in Appendix A.2.
Global Performance is not Representative of Local Performance We begin by examining the
trends in training and evaluation. In particular, we leverage the metadata in FAIR-E ARTH to compare
algorithm performance over local signals to global signals. We frame land and sea data as global
signals, with the localized counterpart being island data.
Based on preliminary correlation analysis, as expected, our results (Appendix A.5 and Fig. 10)
indicate an almost-linear relationship between land and sea data. However, we notice a striking
moderate negative trend between land loss and island loss ( R2= 0.59). When stratified along training
resolution, this trend becomes stronger, and suggests that when optimized for total loss, state-of-the
art INRs suffer a tradeoff between global and local performance.
As a proxy test for this hypothesis, we select the best-performing models for each sub-group (global,
island, and coastline), and examine their performance on other subgroups (Fig. 9). As expected,
there exists a sharp degradation in island performance for top global models, and an even sharper
degradation in global performance for top island models. As a result, regardless of stratification,
INRs of the form given by Eq. (1) seem incapable of competitive performance across all subgroups at
once. Finally, coastline performance indicates a nuanced behavior of spherical harmonics for location
encoding. While coastlines represent a similarly fine signal to islands, total loss is actually positively
correlated with coastline loss, suggesting that Eq. (1) is capable of representing signals that are fine,
but not localized .
Aliasing as a Result of Overfitting As referenced earlier, Eq. (1) is global in nature. The implica-
tions of this are evident in Fig. 7, where the smoothness of land and sea signals are compromised in an
effort to fit to islands. This results in the aliasing and error spikes within landmasses observed in Fig. 6,
as the algorithm overfits towards islands. As we could not identify a clear set of hyperparameters able
to maintain competitive performance in both sub-groups simultaneously, this suggests current SOTA
solutions relying on INR modeling require further development to reach truly equitable predictions.
5 Conclusions
Our experiments and analyses leverage the FAIR-E ARTH dataset to provide a nuanced re-examination
of state-of-the-art algorithmic performance in Earth system modeling. The high-resolution nature of
theFAIR-E ARTH dataset has revealed fine-grained patterns and phenomena that were previously
undetectable. Our findings indicate that the SOTA algorithm’s performance is more sensitive to
data characteristics than previously understood, suggesting that robust and equitable evaluation
datasets like FAIR-E ARTH are necessary to consider a wider range of data scenarios when assessing
algorithmic performance. FAIR-E ARTH will be available as open-source for all practitioners and
research. While our current study was limited to the land-sea dataset, FAIR-E ARTH also provides
multiple other learnable signals; we encourage users to reproduce and iterate on existing results.

5A Appendix
A.1 Details on Spherical Harmonics Encoding
In particular, the sinusoidal nature of the location embedding introduces some interesting challenges
as Fourier representations, and by extension, the spherical harmonic representations, are known to be
particularly suited for stationary signals ( 9). This phenomenon arises from a fundamental property
of these representations: to accurately capture highly localized signals, an extensive set of basis
functions is required. However, this translates to several practical issues in the context of geospatial
data. First, there is a tangible cap to basis size, due to numerical and tractability issues. Second,
with this limited basis size, the embedding is limited in its ability to represent highly localized and
fine-grained features such as islands, peninsulas, or intricate coastlines.
A.2 Training details
Our findings are the results of training over 150 model variations to adequately measure the effects
of hyper-parameters such as embedding size, training resolution, and weight decay. To generate
training data, we following the sampling procedure in ( 19), and similarly sample a validation set of
size 0.2×Num. Training Samples . Finally, our evaluation is conducted over the entire 1800×3600
grid, which consists of a uniform 2D grid with 0.1◦×0.1◦resolution in longitude and latitude.
Training leverages the closed-form spherical harmonic generating function by ( 19). For faster training,
(19) also provides analytic equations up to a certain embedding size, but these need to be re-calculated
when using larger bases. On a simple 8-core CPU machine, the full training suite takes roughly 48
hours to complete.
