Abstract
Climate change is increasing the incidence of
Ô¨Çooding. Many areas in the developing world are
experiencing strong population growth but lack
adequate urban planning. This represents a sig-
niÔ¨Åcant humanitarian risk. We explore the use of
high-cadence satellite imagery provided by Planet
(PlanetSpec, 2019) (Planet, 2019) who‚Äôs Ô¨Çock of
over one hundred ‚ÄôDove‚Äô satellites image the en-
tire earth‚Äôs landmass everyday at 3-5m resolution.
We use a deep learning-based computer vision
approach to measure Ô¨Çood-related humanitarian
risk in 5 cities in Africa.
1. Introduction
By 2050, more than two-thirds of the worlds population
will live in cities, with the majority of this growth occurring
in developing countries (United Nations & Social Affairs,
2018). Rapid urbanization in developing countries is often
unplanned and carries substantial risk for critical infrastruc-
ture, public health and clean water provision. More frequent
and severe Ô¨Çooding caused by climate change is further in-
Ô¨Çaming this. National, state, and local government ofÔ¨Åcials
need access to a new suite of tools to better plan their cities.
Proper measurement and monitoring enables e.g. better
resource allocation for critical infrastructure, commercial
zoning interventions which increase tax revenue, and make
viable insurance markets that incentivize growth in lower
risk areas.
High cadence geospatial imagery coupled with advances in
Deep learning, offer transformative potential to provide such
tools. Inspired by studies in Africa (ButterÔ¨Åeld, 2017) and
(Lall, 2017), we monitor building development in 5 African
cities, and use Ô¨Çood risk data to quantify the humanitarian
risk from Ô¨Çooding.
2. Methodology
Our work Ô¨Çow is shown in Figure 1. Monitoring urban
growth in regions of high Ô¨Çood risk starts with daily optical
imagery produced by Planet. Planet operates the largest
constellation of Earth observation satellites, imaging the
Earths landmass daily at 3-5 meter resolution. To avoidcloudy images, we consume Planets monthly nearly cloud-
free ‚Äôbasemap‚Äô images compiled from multiple days.
We use a variant of U-Net (O. Ronneberger, 2015) - a deep
learning architecture for semantic segmentation of images,
used widely by the remote sensing community - to map
building footprints in the Planet RGB imagery. The training
dataset is compiled from a globally diverse set of geogra-
phies, seasons, and terrains, which has lead to our model
generalizing well.
(FMGlobal, 2019) provides a global map of high-hazard
Ô¨Çood zones derived from a combination of historic Ô¨Çood
data, hydrology, hydraulic science, and up to date environ-
mental monitoring data from rainfall, snow melt and terrain.
Intersecting the building segmentation masks with the high
Ô¨Çood risk zones enables quantitative urban Ô¨Çood risk analy-
sis.
3. Results
3.1. Change in Building Coverage in 5 Cities
We computed the change in urban area from mid-2017 to
early 2019 (the time of writing) for 5 cities: Addis Ababa
in Ethiopia, Bamako in Mali, Bangui in Central African
Republic, Casablanca in Morocco, and Ouagadougou in
Burkina Faso. We selected cities in Africa with varied cli-
mates and terrains, which intersected high-risk Ô¨Çood zones,
and had low cloud coverage. Table 1 shows the percentage
of the urban area - the area classiÔ¨Åed as building by our
model - for each of the 5 cities within high Ô¨Çood risk zones,
as of March 2019. Errors in these values are derived solely
from the Poisson pixel count - in future analyses we will
include additional error terms stemming from geographical
variability. We also show the absolute growth since July
2017, calculated as the difference of the Ô¨Årst 6 versus the
last 6 monthly area values in the period. In all 5 of the cities
we observe urban growth in high Ô¨Çood risk zones.Planetary Scale Monitoring of Urban Growth in High Flood Risk Areas

3.2. Spatio-temporal Analysis of Bangui
In this section we perform a deeper analysis on Bangui -
the city with the highest proportion of urban area within the
high Ô¨Çood risk zone. Visual inspection of the urban change
map for this city suggested that growth was concentrated in
the city outskirts. Thus, we conduct a comparative analysis
between the inner and outer city. We took the Administrative
Level 4 city boundary (HumData, 2016) to deÔ¨Åne the inner
city. We deÔ¨Åned the outer city as 5km buffer beyond the
inner city-limit (Figure 2 (A)). The outer city area was
intersected with the high risk Ô¨Çood area map (Figure 2 (C)).
For the outer city we plotted urban area for every month
from October 2017 to March 2019 (Figure 4 (A)), andmeasured change by taking the mean of the Ô¨Årst and last
6 months in the period. As expected the growth observed
was larger in the outskirts than in the city area as a whole in
Table 1, with a growth of 9.1 %. The majority of the urban
area detected was within the high risk Ô¨Çood area in March
2019 (65.2 %). We further observed that the urban area in
the high Ô¨Çood risk zone grew by 7.9 %, over the period of
study. Note: the months of July, August, September in 2017,
and August and September in 2018 were removed due to
high cloud cover.
4. Conclusion
Using automated analysis of up-to-date satellite imagery
we quantiÔ¨Åed urban area growth in 5 cities in Africa. We
found that alarmingly large areas of these cities were in
high Ô¨Çood risk zones, and that these areas were growing.
Our approach can be applied to address growing Ô¨Çood risks
driven by climate change. In particular,
High temporal cadence results enables analysis of
trends on shorter timescales than previously possible.
The spatial resolution of this imagery allows for aggre-
gation across multiple dimensions, including correla-
tion with external Ô¨Çood risk maps and separation of
inner urban cores from city outskirts.
The global availability of satellite imagery, and power
of deep learning-based models which generalize across
diverse terrain, mean this approach can be applied
across widely varied environments, at planetary scale.Planetary Scale Monitoring of Urban Growth in High Flood Risk Areas
