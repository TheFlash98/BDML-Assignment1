Learning representations to predict landslide occurrences and detect illegal
mining across multiple domains
Aneesh Rangnekar1Matthew Hoffman1 2
Abstract
Modelling landslide occurrences is challenging
due to lack of valuable prior information on the
trigger. Satellites can provide crucial insights for
identifying landslide activity and characterizing
patterns spatially and temporally. We propose to
analyze remote sensing data from affected regions
using deep learning methods, Ô¨Ånd correlation in
the changes over time, and predict future land-
slide occurrences and their potential causes. The
learned networks can then be applied to generate
task-speciÔ¨Åc imagery, including but not limited to,
illegal mining detection and disaster relief mod-
elling.
1. Introduction
Landslides occur throughout the world and are caused by a
range of factors, including natural: earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, heavy rainfalls, man-made: deforestation, dam
constructions, and illegal mining (we refer the reader to
(Gariano & Guzzetti, 2016; Lewkowicz & Way, 2019) for
relevant literature). Fig. 1 shows one such location in the
village of Malin, located in Pune (Maharashtra, India). This
landslide was classiÔ¨Åed as occurred due to heavy rainfall ,
although there are other possible factors that may have led
to the eventual slide: (1) deforestation, (2) agriculture, (3)
mining, and (4) the construction of a dam in the area. These
factors tend to have a long term effect of on soil forma-
tion and properties. For example, deforestation is a major
contributor to climate change due to the removal of natural
carbon sink, but it is equally responsible for loss of root
structures that Ô¨Årmly hold the soil. We propose to lever-
age the data available from affected landslide(s) locations

to lose its formation and ultimately lead to a landslide under heavy
rainfall conditions. Our idea aims at using these sort of cues to
predict potential landslide occurrences in the future.
to study the underlying changes and predict potential fu-
ture events based on similarity in patterns. Furthermore,
by knowing the probable causes and effect, we propose to
use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to
model what an area would look like under certain conditions.
For example, if there is suspicion of illegal mining in a re-
gion, a network that has been trained to look for variations
due to natural and human activities can infer what the com-
position would look like post mining. This information can
be used to more easily detect and halt the activity. Similarly,
we can infer the best possible locations to plant trees and
mitigate soil erosion through reforestation efforts. At this
stage, we consider gathering data from six main causes of
landslide occurrences‚Äîvolcanic eruptions, earthquakes, de-
forestation, heavy rainfall, mining, and construction‚Äîand
one positive sample‚Äîthriving forest ecosystem.
2. Related Works
For the scope of this paper, we brieÔ¨Çy review previous land-
slide detection approaches and relevant deep learning archi-
tectures.
Literature review. Landslide modelling and detection has
been a topic of interest, primarily concerned with mappingLearning representations to predict landslide occurrences
regional landslide susceptibility (Dou et al., 2019a; Kang
et al., 2019; Dou et al., 2019b; Meena et al., 2019; Ghor-
banzadeh et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2018; Shirzadi et al.,
2018; Uemoto et al., 2019). All of the existing work uses
different machine learning approaches on highly region-
localized data and speciÔ¨Åc imaging platforms. For example,
Uemoto et al. processed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake (Japan) for generat-
ing amplitude and height difference maps which they later
fused for performing landslide detection. Ghorbanzadeh
et al. compared different machine learning approaches (e.g.
random forests) for landslide detection by combining op-
tical data from the Rapid Eye satellite and topographic in-
formation at Rasuwa district (Nepal). To the best of our
knowledge, no one has yet combined data from various loca-
tions and created a common model that is location-agnostic
and can be used to predict future occurrences. Inspired by
ExtremeWeather (Racah et al., 2017), one piece of this idea
is to gather a global dataset spanning multiple domains of
satellite imagery to facilitate large-scale learning.
Model architectures. We derive our inspiration for this
project from cGANs (Isola et al., 2017), variational autoen-
coders (V AE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013), Augmented Cy-
cleGAN (Almahairi et al., 2018), and MUNIT (Huang et al.,
2018), which all learn mappings between either the same
domain or different domains for generating new imagery.
3. Idea
We propose to develop a framework to identify temporal
patterns that can lead to robust predictions over a hetero-
geneous set of locations around the world. Formally, we
seek to answer the question: Given a model that has seen
variations across America and China, can it generalize to
an unseen formation in India? What are the limitations and
how can we overcome them?
Within this framework, we seek to collectively train an en-
semble of networks on different image domains. To start,
we propose the use of Landsat 8 and SAR-equipped satellite
(e.g. Sentinel 1) data, combined with position metadata.
Each of these data sources has its own set of advantages
and limitations. For example, Landsat 8 cannot see through
clouds, but Sentinel 1 is easily able to see through clouds,
haze, and darkness. Position metadata is required for the
network to get an idea of the location and weather condi-
tions for the images it is processing. Christie et al. (2018)
found that appending an LSTM-converted (Hochreiter &
Schmidhuber, 1997) metadata feature vector to the image
vector helped in classifying aerial images at varying loca-
tions. We propose to adapt a similar approach for generating
relevant embeddings.
In this paper, we propose to model three sets of networks

VAE: As an initial proof of concept to observe if latent
encoding can capture variety in distribution as a func-
tion of parameters like location and weather conditions.
This helps to understand how difÔ¨Åcult it is will be to
create an overall network modelled across images from
all over the globe.
Predictor: A spatio-temporal network with attention
to observe past t-frames and predict landslide occur-
rence along with a conÔ¨Ådence score. The attention
module is required for the network to learn to ignore
imagery that has high cloud density in Landsat 8 do-
main as it does not contain valuable information. The
network also outputs a distribution over probable land-
slide causes for pre-disaster management.
cGAN: To generate future possible outcomes for a
given scenario that includes a variety of tasks (e.g.
model movement to assess damage quantity in a given
region and begin relocation). This is currently based on
a single image but can be extended to include a series of
images, or even trained in a multitask fashion alongside
landslide prediction. The task itself is encoded into the
network using a latent-space distribution which can be
later varied to generate multiple outcomes.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose to build a novel large scale dataset
of landslide affected areas for purpose of observing correla-
tions between different regions across the globe. The main
goal is to develop a location-agnostic network for predict-
ing the likelihood of a landslide occurring and its probably
cause. We will also investigate whether it is possible toLearning representations to predict landslide occurrences
detect illegal mining by having the network sample a suite
of possible post-mining scenarios and comparing them with
the imagery at hand. Lastly, we will also explore the po-
tential application of the same trained network to predict
disaster relief by modelling the extent of damage caused by
a landslide event.
