•The rise in global temperature has been 
accompanied by a rise in extreme weather events 
such as temperature anomalies.
•In western and central Europe, soils typically contain 
sufficient water to sustain high evaporation and limit 
surface sensible heating. In recent years, a decrease 
in soil moisture has been observed (Fig . 1.b.3.). This 
leads to soil -moisture temperature feedbacks, which 
can amplify hot extremes beyond greenhouse -gas 
induced global warming.
•Causal discovery methods can identify the underlying 
causal relationships between various climate 
variables to discern the factors contributing to 
unusual weather patterns.
•We frame the problem of uncovering soil moisture 
drivers in Western Europe using regime -specific 
causal discovery and apply Regime -PCMCI [1], 
implemented in the Tigramite Python package 
(https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite ).
•Data with distribution shifts such as anomalies can 
have periods during which the data exhibits different 
statistical patterns.
•Each regime is characterized by its own set of 
statistical properties: the "normal" causal structure 
or causal mechanisms are altered, resulting in 
different regimes governing the "normal" and 
"anomalous" state, as exemplified in Fig. 2.
•We model each regime using a structural causal 
model (SCM), under the assumption that an 
exogeneous variable 𝑅describes the 𝑁𝐾regimes .
•The regime -specific SCM for regime 𝑘with 𝑘=
1,…,𝑁𝐾at time 𝑡is written as 
𝑿𝑘,𝑡=𝑓𝑘𝑃𝑎𝑘𝑿𝑡,𝑼𝑘,𝑡
−𝑃𝑎𝑘𝑿𝑡−the vector of variables which are 
direct causes of 𝑋𝑖,𝑡∈𝑿𝑡
−𝑼𝑘,𝑡−exogeneous noise.•Regime -PCMCI [1] builds upon the PCMCI [2] 
algorithm. PCMCI uses an independence -testing 
approach adapted to the time -series case for 
constaint -based causal discovery, and additionally 
orients edges from past to future .
•Regime -PCMCI finds a regime assignment for each 
sample by alternating between two steps, as also 
depicted in Fig.1.c.:
1.Discovering regime -specific causal graphs using 
PCMCI. At first, a random assignment of 
regimes is used.
2.Detecting regimes: 
−At iteration 𝑞, predict ො𝑥𝑘,𝑡𝑞=෠𝐺𝑡(𝑃𝑎𝑘(𝑿𝑘,𝑡,Θ𝑡)

𝑘usingthefunctional withparameters Θ𝑡.
−Predict the regime labels 𝛾𝑘using the distance 
between the real and predicted data for a new 
iteration of the optimization, subject to 
constraints (1)and (2), where 𝑁𝐶is the 
number of transitions between regimes (user -

•The dataset contains daily values for the time period 
1950 -2022 in Western Europe (see Fig.1.b .1.) from 
ERA5 [3] for the following:
−Mean air temperature 2m above ground (T2m),
−Root -zone (1m) soil moisture (SM),
−Surface sensible heat flux (SH),
−Surface sensible heat flux (SH), 
−Surface latent heat flux (LH),
−Large -scale circulation function at 250 hPa
(Stream), 
−Shortwave downward radiation (SW), 
−The vegetation -atmosphere coupling (VAC) index 
[4] computed using thresholding of SM and T2m 
anomalies as in Fig. 1.b.1 .
•We search for the causal links between LH, SH, and 
SM in the moist and dry regimes. We hypothesize the 
unionized causal graph in Fig. 5:
−In the dry regime, drier soils lead to a reduction 
in LH flux (the energy used for evaporation), 
which leads to an increase in SH flux. These 
conditions can further exacerbate hot and dry 
conditions [5]. 
−In moist regimes, LH is mostly insensitive to SM 
variations. Evaporation is instead controlled by 
other factors, such as cloud cover or sunshine 
hours [6 ].
•We aggregate data points using three -day averages in 
the time period 1993 -2022. 
•We search for three regimes: dry, moist, and one 
regime for all samples that do not fit into the others.•We present results for the moist regime (regime 1) 
and the dry regime (regime 2), as for regime 0 no 
further links were found.
•We discover the key causal links which characterize 
the moist and dry regimes in a simplified setting
•Regime -based causal discovery offers a promising 
approach to understanding anomalies, but can be 
particularly challenging when data stems from a high -
dimensional, strongly coupled system.
•Challenges also arise due to limitations of the 
Regime -PCMCI algorithm, such as:
−Strong assumptions for causal discovery, such as 
causal sufficiency, no unmeasured confounders, 
no acyclicity,
−Assumptions of the conditional independence 
tests,
−Sensitivity to selected time -scale,
−Computational complexity of the algorithm, as 
well as possible model and algorithm bias.
