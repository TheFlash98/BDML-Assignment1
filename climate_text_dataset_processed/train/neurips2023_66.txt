Abstract
Environmental indicators can play a crucial role in forecasting infectious disease
outbreaks, holding promise for community-level interventions. Yet, significant gaps
exist in the literature regarding the influence of changes in environmental conditions
on disease spread over time and across different regions and climates making it chal-
lenging to obtain reliable forecasts. This paper aims to propose an approach to pre-
dict malaria incidence over time and space by employing a multi-dimensional long
short-term memory model (M-LSTM) to simultaneously analyse environmental in-
dicators such as vegetation, temperature, night-time lights, urban/rural settings, and
precipitation. We developed and validated a spatio-temporal data fusion approach to
predict district-level malaria incidence rates for the year 2017 using spatio-temporal
data from 2000 to2016 across three South Asian countries: Pakistan, India, and
Bangladesh. In terms of predictive performance the proposed M-LSTM model
results in lower country-specific error rates compared to existing spatio-temporal
deep learning models. The data and code have been made publicly available at the
study GitHub repository: https://github.com/usmanweb/CITY-at-LUMS .
1 Climate Impact Statement
Climate change has been linked with acceleration and aggravation of the spread of infectious diseases;
consequently worsening the risk to human health. Pathogens responsible for diseases such as malaria,
cholera, Zika virus and others are known to spread more easily amidst extreme environmental changes
such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires caused by globally rising temperatures. Moreover,
the spread of infectious diseases varies geographically, and this variability is connected to changes
in the local environment. In the context of the South Asia use-case presented in this study, malaria
incidence was predicted for each district in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh for the year 2017 using
geo-spatio-temporal data from 2000 to2016 . The proposed approach integrates environmental
factors and historical malaria data, offering the ability to make localised temporal predictions. This
fusion of spatial and historical information, generalisable to other infectious diseases affected by
the environment, has the potential to contribute significantly to country and regional level malaria
early warning systems, providing valuable insights for proactive and targeted interventions against a
rapidly changing climate.
2 Introduction
Malaria remains one of the leading communicable causes of death Gelband et al. (2020); Cowman
et al. (2016). Approximately half of the world‚Äôs population is considered at risk, predominantly in
37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023), Louisiana, United States.African and South Asian countries Rosenthal et al. (2019). Although malaria is preventable, spatio-
temporal heterogeneity in climatological, sociodemographic, and environmental risk factors make
outbreak prediction challenging. Data-driven approaches accounting for spatio-temporal variability
may offer potential for region-specific malaria predicting tools.
Production of accurate models is complicated on two fronts. Firstly, tracking malaria incidence
can present challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings. Often, these measurements are
extrapolated from household surveys that are small in scale and expensive, and therefore prone to
mis-estimation. Secondly, while environmental factors have been found to play a role in influencing
the life cycle of the malarial parasite Gaudart et al. (2009), the fluctuation of outbreak patterns
across different regions and time periods, and their dependence on multi-dimensional factors, make
modelling these impacts complex. Various methodologies have been developed to address this
challenge in a data-driven manner. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have gained
prominence in recent years for their ability to analyze complex spatio-temporal data. For instance,
the use of classification techniques such as KNN, Naive Bayes, and Extreme Gradient Boost have
proven effective in examining the relationship between historical meteorological data and records of
malarial cases Kalipe et al. (2018). Additionally, the integration of spatio-temporal earth observation
measurements, e.g. sea surface temperature variability, has shown promise in machine learning
approaches for predicting malaria outbreaks Martineau et al. (2022). We propose a deep learning
method (M-LSTM) to analyze historical environmental data with the aim to provide insight into how
the combination of such factors can contribute to the development of early warning systems.
2.1 Contributions
We derived a bespoke dataset on environmental indicators such as nighttime lights directly from
satellite imagery. We then linked this bespoke dataset with publicly available environmental indi-
cators datasets and malaria incidence datasets. Subsequently, we implemented a meticulous data
segmentation process, dividing the data based on both spatial locations and time, providing precise
and localized insights. This enabled us to leverage a comprehensive set of 43features for each spatial
location for each year included in the study. Together, these contributions resulted in improved
predictive performance as well as a detailed dataset for the use of the wider research community.

100LSTM units. Subsequently, a fully connected layer is employed, followed by linear regression
to estimate the malaria incidence rate for the year 2017 through spatio-temporal splitting and for a
random year through spatial splitting.
23 Methodology
3.1 Data Sources
1.Malaria Incidence Rates : We obtained data on malaria incidence rates for South Asia
covering the period from 2000 to 2017. There are 1,517 spatial locations for Pakistan, 28,395
for India, and 2,260 for Bangladesh. These data were sourced from the Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) datasets provided by the US Agency for International Development.
2.Environmental Factors : We collected data on environmental factors linked to malaria
outbreaks, including temperature (measured in degrees Celsius), rainfall (measured in
millimeters), and the average Normalized Vegetation Index for each month from year 2000
to 2017. These environmental data were extracted from the Advancing Research on Nutrition
and Agriculture (AReNA) project conducted by the International Food Policy Research
Institute (IFPRI) in 2020 , as documented in https://www.ifpri.org/ .
3.Nighttime Lights Data : Additionally, data pertaining to nighttime lights were gathered from
two distinct satellites. The first satellite, known as DMSP OLS (Defense Meteorological
Program Operational Linescan System), provided nighttime lights data for the years 1992 to
2014 . The second satellite, VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Nighttime
Day/Night Band Composites Version 1, offered data spanning from 2012 to2023 .
3.2 Modeling pipeline
The architecture for forecasting malaria incidence rates comprised a structured approach using a
four-layer M-LSTM model, comprising 100 LSTM units per layer (see ablative study in Appendix A),
alongside a fully connected regression layer (see Fig. 1: (b)). The modelling process included the
collection of time-series environmental data and historical malaria rates. Feature engineering created
a dataset with temporal sequences of environmental data and corresponding malaria rates (see Fig. 1:
(a)). Data division into training, validation, and test sets ensured robust model evaluation. The
core methodology involved constructing a four-layer LSTM network to capture temporal patterns,
with training focusing on minimizing prediction errors. Hyperparameter tuning optimized model
parameters, while validation assessed generalization. Testing yielded objective performance metrics.
3.3 Data Pre-processing
Data preprocessing involved the following steps:
1.Data Cleaning and Merging : We conducted a comprehensive data cleaning and merging
process to consolidate information from both nighttime lights datasets. Nighttime light
intensity was quantified using digital units, ranging from 0(indicating the absence of light)
to63(representing the highest level of light intensity).
2.Temporal Batching : The data for each country was organized into distinct batches, with
each batch containing 18data points and 43features (1 NTL, 12 NDVI, 12 Temperature, 12
Rainfall, 1 Latitude, 1 Longitude, 1 Urban/Rural, 1 Prev Malari value, 1 country, 1 Province).
These 18instances precisely corresponded to the years from 2000 to2017 . Furthermore,
each batch was associated with specific geographical coordinates, including longitude and
latitude.
3.Training and Testing Split : Out of the total 1,517 spatial locations for Pakistan, 28,395 for
India, and 2,260 for Bangladesh, 80% were assigned for training and model validation, with
the remaining 20% (In terms of space or time) earmarked for testing.
These preprocessing steps were essential in readying the data for subsequent analysis and modeling,
guaranteeing its proper organization and suitability for the application of artificial intelligence
methods (M-LSTM, Conv-LSTM, and Random Forest), as detailed in section 4.

We developed and verified the Multidimensional LSTM model, contrasting its performance with
an existing spatio-temporal model Conv-LSTM model Shi et al. (2015), and an existing classical
regression model: Random Forest (with 100 trees) Breiman (2001). The results displayed in Table 1
demonstrate that the Multi-dimensional LSTM (M-LSTM) model surpasses the Conv-LSTM and
Random Forest methods. Generally, higher R-squared and reduced error rates are attainable with
increased LSTM layers and 2017 prediction year. The M-LSTM model, incorporating dense input
connections, reduced RMSE (on average) by 29.41% compared to the Conv-LSTM model.
The evaluation metrics (see ablative study in Appendix A and evaluation metrics in Appendix C
for details), together provided a comprehensive evaluation of the model‚Äôs predictive performance.
Data partitioning played a pivotal role in our evaluation strategy. The dataset underwent division
into "spatial" and "spatio-temporal" splits for both training and testing. In the spatial split, an 80%
training and 20% testing split was upheld for forecasting the malaria incidence rate in a random
year. Conversely, in the spatio-temporal split, the training set comprised environmental data and
malaria incidence rates from 2000 to 2016, with testing conducted to predict the malaria incidence
rate for the year 2017. This approach ensured comprehensive evaluation across different data
distributions, enabling us to assess the model‚Äôs robustness and performance under varying time and
space conditions.
5 Qualitative Evaluation
5.1 Bivariate Maps
In the qualitative assessment, bivariate maps comparing true and predicted malaria incidence rates are
depicted in Fig.2. In the case of the proposed model, the true and predicted values exhibit a consistent
correlation. For instance, in areas where the true malaria incidence rate is high, the predicted malaria
incidence rate also tends to be high, as observed in regions with dark blue coloring in the magnified
image of Fig. 2: (a). However, in the Conv-LSTM model, there are instances where the true values

for certain regions are high, but the predicted values are low, as indicated by the dark pink coloring in
the zoomed image of Fig. 2: (b).

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced a South Asia case study where we predicted annual district-level
malaria incidence rates using historical data from previous years. We used a data-driven approach to
fuse multi-dimensional environmental and historical malaria information without recourse to prior
modelling assumptions. The methods developed in this paper may empower decision-makers to study
and predict malaria and ultimately other infectious disease outbreaks early in time for regional and
international planning against climate-induced environmental changes in local environments.

B Earth Observation (Nighttime Lights, NDVI, etc.) and DHS Malaria Data
The Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA) project, funded by the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, is a six-year initiative implemented from 2015 to 2020 in South Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa. It aims to close significant knowledge gaps by conducting policy-relevant

research at scale and generating datasets and analytical tools to benefit the broader research com-
munity. One of the major challenges in agriculture and nutrition research is the scarcity of data.
Existing datasets that include both agriculture and nutrition information are often limited in size
and geographical scope. To address this, the ARENA team has constructed a large multi-level,
multi-country dataset by combining individual and household-level data from the Demographic
Health Surveys (DHS) with geo-referenced data on agricultural production, agroecology, climate,
demography, and infrastructure.

The DHS Program1has been collecting and disseminating accurate and representative data on
population, health, HIV , and nutrition since 1984. These nationally representative household surveys
have been conducted in over 90 countries through more than 400 surveys. The DHS surveys cover
a wide range of health and demographic indicators, including fertility and mortality rates, family
planning, maternal and child health, vaccination, prevalence of anemia, literacy rates, water and
sanitation, domestic violence, women‚Äôs empowerment, and tobacco use. The surveys also collect GPS
location data for surveyed clusters, allowing for analysis in conjunction with additional geospatial

and Health Survey) surveys, which primarily provide information about health-related issues and
are associated with geographic coordinates, and standard earth observation data, which includes
information like nighttime lights (used as a proxy for poverty), NDVI (Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index), precipitation, and temperature.
The key idea here is that these two sets of data can be combined or linked together, allowing
researchers to conduct cross-country and country-level studies on various topics related to the
relationship between poverty and health.
By integrating DHS survey data, which typically provides insights into health outcomes and condi-
tions in specific geographic areas, with earth observation data, which provides environmental and
socio-economic indicators such as nighttime lights (used as a proxy for poverty), NDVI (a measure of
vegetation), precipitation, and temperature, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding
of how poverty and environmental factors influence health outcomes. This integrated approach
facilitates research that examines these relationships on both a broad cross-country scale and at the
individual country level. It enables researchers to explore questions like how environmental condi-
8tions and poverty levels impact health disparities across different regions and countries, ultimately
contributing to a deeper understanding of the poverty-health nexus.
As depicted in figures 4, 5, 6 and 7, a comparison is made between the malaria incidence rate
and earth observation Indicators, including Nighttime Lights Intensity, NDVI, precipitation and
temperature respectively.
C Evaluation Metrics
In-depth analysis of the model‚Äôs performance encompassed several critical dimensions. Firstly, we
explored the impact of varying the number of training epochs, conducting experiments with epoch
counts of 10, 20, 30 and 100. Secondly, we closely monitored the behavior of the training loss
throughout diverse configurations. We observed that this metric exhibited fluctuations across different
training scenarios, consistently demonstrating a decrease with an increasing number of training
epochs. In tandem, the model‚Äôs R-squared exhibited remarkable variability, spanning a broad range.
These variations in R-squared underscored the model‚Äôs adaptability to different training settings.
Additionally, we examined the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), another fundamental measure of
prediction accuracy. RMSE‚Äôs behavior paralleled the trends observed in the other error metrics. In
the majority of configurations, RMSE values consistently remained low, reinforcing the model‚Äôs
reliability in generating precise predictions.
Moreover, we considered the architectural aspects of the model, focusing on the LSTM units and
layers. The model incorporated LSTM units with varying counts, ranging from 100 to 200, and
LSTM layers, which could be configured as either 1, 2, 3 or 4. These architectural choices were
systematically factored into the evaluation process, shedding light on their impact on predictive
performance.
