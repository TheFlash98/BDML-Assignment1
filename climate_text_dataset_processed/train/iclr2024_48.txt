ABSTRACT
Monitoring Greenhouse Gas (GHG) concentrations and emissions is essential to
mitigate climate change. Thanks to the large amount of satellite data available,
it is now possible to understand GHGs’ behaviours at a broad scale. However,
due to remote sensing devices technological limitations, the task of global high
resolution (HR) monitoring remains an open problem. To avoid waiting for new
missions and better data to be generated, it is therefore relevant to experiment
with processing methods able to improve existing datasets. Our paper proposes
to apply Super Resolution (SR), a Deep Learning (DL) approach commonly used
in Computer Vision (CV), on global L3 satellite data. We produce a daily high
resolution global CO 2dataset that opens the door for globally consistent point
source monitoring.
1 I NTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATIONS
According to the sixth IPCC report, GHGs are responsible for an increase of the global surface tem-
perature of over 1°since 1850-1900 (Core Writing Team et al.). Amongst GHGs, the report high-
lights the predominant role played by CO 2and CH 4. Accurately understanding the emission process
of GHGs can lead to more impactful decision making and actions to reduce global warming. Ac-
cordingly, emission datasets have been compiled by aggregating estimations and reports (Climate
TRACE coalition, 2022; European Environment Agency, 2023). Besides, daily monitoring allows
for emissions tracking (Nassar et al., 2021). A global HR daily GHG monitoring dataset could there-
fore help validate and complete these inventories. Unfortunately, remote sensing satellite imagery
is either sparse and incomplete, as it will be generated following the swath of the satellite (Earth
Science Data Systems, NASA, 2016), or possesses limited spatial or temporal resolution when pro-
cessed to produce global maps. Studies have shown that machine learning methods can help over-
come part of these limitations (He et al., 2022). The work described in this paper focuses on CO 2
monitoring and brings the following contributions:
• We apply SR to the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) L3 dataset to generate HR
global maps of column-averaged dry air mole fraction of atmospheric CO2 (XCO2). The
framework can be transferred to other GHGs and is not specific to CO 2.
• We introduce a new HR dataset with a resolution of 0.03°*0.04°. This dataset offers the
possibility to perform global XCO2 monitoring consistently.
• We show that our method does not introduce noise compared to the original Low Reso-
lution (LR) dataset and offers a quantitative improvement in performance over alternative
methods.

2 R ELATED WORKS
Different methods have been used to produce global mapping datasets of XCO2. Statistical meth-
ods rely on interpolation to fill the gaps left by satellite-observed XCO2. Kriging interpolation and
its variations compose the majority of the literature done following this approach (He et al., 2020;
Zammit-Mangion et al., 2018; Bhattacharjee & Chen, 2020). Chemical Transport Model (CTM)
simulations constitute a branch of statistical physics-informed methods to generate complete global
data on XCO2, and in particular fluxes (Jacobson et al., 2023; Pillai & Neininger, 2012). The com-
putational cost of these simulations unfortunately restricts the resolution of the global maps to coarse
resolution. Other paradigms involve the fusion of multiple sensor’s data in order to start with a more
comprehensive covered area and therefore reduce the uncertainty of the generated maps (Wang et al.,
2023). Finally, Machine Learning (ML) and DL-based methods are also found in the literature (He
et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).
3 M ETHODS
3.1 S UPER RESOLUTION
SR refers to the process of enhancing the resolution or quality of an image beyond its original level.
This technique is commonly used in image processing and computer vision to improve the clarity
and details of images. A higher-resolution version of an image is formed based on a LRinput (Tsai
& Huang, 1984). When the input consists of only one image, it is referred to as Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) (Yang et al., 2019). As CV frameworks mostly rely on deep learning techniques,
the current state of the art of SR models in remote sensing (RS) relies on neural networks (Wang
et al., 2022b). The reconstructed output of a SR model presents features with greater detail than the
LR input, thus enabling better analysis of the data. However, as SR is an inverse problem, different
models will associate different SR images to the same input (Jo et al., 2021). In this work, the
input is XCO2 data under matrix form. Converting this data to RGB images would require extra
preprocessing steps, which would add noise to our input data. We therefore consider the task as a
CV task where XCO2 maps are 1-channel images. Our model’s architecture is a modified version
of the framework from Haris et al. (2020), which was selected based on a benchmark on RS data
done by Wang et al. (2022a). This model performs multiple up- and down-samplings iteratively to
better extract the relation between LR and HR images. Convolutional and deconvolutional layers are
associated to form the upsampling and downsampling blocks. It was initially developed to perform
up to 8-times upsampling, so we adapted the kernel size, padding and striding. To avoid excessive
memory usage and increase the training speed, we also modified the layers configuration to reduce
the number of weights and applied the Distributed Data Parallel framework from PyTorch (Li et al.,
2020). We have been able to increase the resolution 16-times, effectively bringing the XCO2 global
maps’ resolution close to 1km*1km, which is necessary to detect emission point sources.
4 D ATASETS
4.1 T RAINING
As there is no HR XCO2 data for our model to learn from, we use the L3 products of the Land
Surface Temperature (LST) dataset from MODIS (Wan et al., 2015) during the training phase. After
downsampling the data, our model learns to reconstruct LST maps to its original resolution, which
is approximately the same spatial resolution as our target resolution (see Table 1).

4.2 L OW RESOLUTION DATASET
The OCO-2 and its successor OCO-3 are satellites from NASA. Their mission is to monitor CO 2(El-
dering et al., 2012) and they possess a radiometric resolution of the order of 1ppm. We use the L3
assimilated dataset (Weir et al., 2021) from OCO-2 as our LR dataset. This dataset consists of
global maps of XCO2 at a resolution of 0.5°*0.625°. It is available at a daily or monthly temporal
resolution, produced using NASA’s modeling and data assimilation system.
4.3 V ALIDATION DATASET
The Total Column Carbon Network (TCCON) (Wunch et al., 2011) is a family of ground sensors
with sites located around the world that monitors column concentrations from CO 2,CH 4(Parker
et al., 2011), CO, and N 2O (Sha et al., 2020). To assess the accuracy of the SR XCO2 maps, we
compare them with the latest version of TCCON data (Laughner et al., 2023). This data was obtained
from the TCCON Data Archive hosted by CaltechDATA at https://tccondata.org.
5 R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We compare our results with pre-existing methods which also produce global data. Our benchmark
consists of a dataset from Wang et al. (2023) obtained from the fusion of OCO-2 L2 data with the
CAMS re-analysis dataset (Agusti-Panareda et al., 2022) and a HR dataset also derived from OCO-2
L3 data relying on bicubic interpolation as described in Xiang et al. (2022). These were selected for
the quantitative quality of the produced data and their spatial and temporal availability.
Figure 1: Visualisation of XCO2 over western Europe according to the four datasets used for this benchmark.
From top left to bottom right: (a) LR dataset, (b) after SR (ours), (c) fusion dataset, (d) after bicubic interpola-
tion. On this example, we observe a average bias difference between the LR and the fusion maps.
Figure 1 shows a visual comparison between our model and the benchmark methods for XCO2 data
over western Europe. A smoothing effect is noticeable on the bicubic interpolation map over the
North Sea (subfigure d) while more high-frequency details are created using our method (subfigure
b).
Results displayed in Table 2 demonstrate that our SR model is able to significantly increase the
resolution of the original LR dataset while improving on all the metrics. The comparison also holds
when comparing the super resolved XCO2 maps with other methods. The fusion dataset presents on
average a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) well above 1ppm and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
of 0.85ppm while our dataset lies at 0.92ppm and 0.70ppm respectively. Bicubic interpolation is a
3Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024
close second on most metrics. Detailed results based on sensor location are presented in Appendix
B and confirm that our method is more consistent spatially.
Table 2: Evaluation of the produced XCO2 data according to the benchmark
The best value for each metrics is highlighted. LRis the original OCO-2 L3 data, BIC is derived from bicubic
interpolation, and Fusion is from Wang et al. (2023). Metrics are the average over every TCCON ground
sensors location between 2015 and 2020
SR (ours) LR BIC Fusion
RMSE 0.9180 0.9441 0.9436 1.1196
R20.9673 0.9654 0.9655 0.9514
MAE 0.7027 0.7182 0.7190 0.8505
To quantitatively assess the difference between SR using our model and using bicubic interpolation,
we introduce an Improvement Ratio (IR) for each SR method. We define it as the following:
IRsite=Nsite
improved
Nsite
samples(1)
where for each site, Nsite
improved represents the number of times where SR is closer to the ground truth
andNsite
samples represents the total number of samples for this site. A ratio of 1 (or 100%) indicates
that the model always improves on the LR while a ratio of 0 indicates that the model always produces
worse results.
Figure 2: IR comparison between our model (blue) and bicubic (red) with available ground sensors
data. The list of ground sensors abbreviations is presented in Appendix A.
Figure 2 shows that our model performs SR more consistently across the different sites, with the
IR never going below 40% and only being worse than the bicubic one on 5 sites out of 24. This
consistency is confirmed overall with our model producing an average IR of 57% against an average
IR of 51% for bicubic SR.
5.1 D ISCUSSION
Our results show that our model outperforms other methods quantitatively. Furthermore, while they
prove that it understands XCO2’s behaviour better than statistical interpolation, we believe that
more performance can be unlocked if we train the model on a physical variable closer to CO 2than
temperature. Additionally, including sparse data acquired from satellites could also lead to better
results by guiding the model in its reconstruction of a SR map. Frameworks already exist to combine
additional data with ML models (Buizza et al., 2022). Finally, Balashov et al. (2022) have indicated
that XCH 4L3 maps based on TROPOMI (Veefkind et al., 2012) data are currently being developed
and will be released in the future. This will allow this work to be transferred to another GHG,
increasing the relevance of our gas-agnostic framework.

6 C ONCLUSION
In this paper we proposed a method to create a globally consistent daily HR XCO2 dataset. Our
experiments have shown that our model is able to increase the resolution of the L3 maps produced
by the OCO-2 to the order of 3km*4km while also improving concentration monitoring: our model
is more robust spatially and temporally compared to other methods. This represents a good first
attempt at applying SR to XCO2 fields and areas of improvement have been highlighted for future
works. Moreover, the produced dataset provides the opportunity to study and quantify the impact of
known sources on their surroundings or detect unreported point sources.
