Abstract
Globally, buildings account for 30% of end-use energy consumption and 27% of
energy sector emissions, and yet the building sector is lacking in low-temporal-
latency, high-spatial-resolution data on energy consumption and resulting emissions.
Existing methods tend to either have low resolution, high latency (often a year
or more), or rely on data typically unavailable at scale (such as self-reported
energy consumption). We propose a machine learning based bottom-up model that
combines satellite-imagery-derived features to compute Scope 1 global emissions
estimates both for residential and commercial buildings at a 1km2resolution with
monthly global updates.
1 Introduction
Direct (a.k.a. Scope 11) emissions from residential and commercial buildings result from onsite fuel
use such as natural gas, oil, and kerosene consumption. Residential buildings primarily use these
fuels for thermal comfort (space and water heating), cooking, and other equipment and appliances; in
commercial buildings, space and water heating generally remain the largest end-use. The magnitude
of these end uses is correlated with, for example: building size, climate conditions, and the number
of occupants [2]. However, timely and accessible high-spatial-resolution data on these are limited.
Existing bottom-up methods leverage data typically not accessible at scale, such as information on
a building’s insulation, appliances in a building, and information on occupant behavior [ 3]. These
approaches may rely on building physics [ 4] or statistical approaches, but the data requirements for
these approaches prevent them from being scaled globally.
Existing top-down approaches look to find broad criteria by which to disaggregate values of energy
consumption and associated emissions. Existing estimates include the Open-source Data Inventory
for Anthropogenic CO 2[5], the Community Emissions Data System [ 6], the Emissions Database for
Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) [ 7], the Global Carbon Grid [ 8], and the Global Gridded
Daily CO2 Emissions Dataset (GRACED)[ 9]. While GRACED data is published near-monthly, most
other key data are produced with a year or more of latency. Additionally, the highest resolution of
1"Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or
owned by an organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles)." [1]

down emissions into residential and commercial subsectors as well as separate emissions estimates
into individual greenhouse gasses.
2 Proposed Building Emissions Machine Learning Model
To address these challenges, we propose a high-resolution (1 km2)2, global machine learning (ML)
model that is able to be updated monthly, separately provides estimates for both residential and
commercial subsector Scope 1 building emissions, and provides estimates of the three primary
greenhouse gasses (CO 2, CH 4, and NO x). This will be accomplished by estimating the presence
and growth in building area ( A) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, predicting energy use intensity
(EUI ) from contributing factors including temperature fluctuations and economic indicators, and
determining regional emissions factors ( EF) based on regional fuel mixes used in buildings. We will
estimate building emissions ( GHG ) as the product of these three quantities, GHG =A×EUI×EF.
First, to predict building area , we will build on the work of Liu et al. 2023 [ 10] to estimate building
area from publicly-available satellite imagery and apply this at a global scale, providing monthly
estimates of building coverage.3Second, we will estimate energy use intensity (energy consumed
per unit area of building). We will fine-tune the NASA HLS Geospatial Foundation Model [ 11] to
use as a convolutional neural network (CNN) for satellite image feature extraction across a global
grid; each pair of grid index coordinates is denoted a, b. A combination of satellite imagery and
building emissions proxy data will extract building-related features associated with emissions from
globally-gridded satellite images xim
a,bas part of our fine-tuning process, i.e., him
a,b=fcnn(xim
a,b). We
will then combine the feature vector output from the CNN with emissions-related characteristics for
buildings including population, temperature, and economic indicators ( xb,xp,xt,xe), all geospatially
aligned to match the same global grid as the satellite imagery, i.e., hec
a,b=fga(xb,xp,xt,xw). The
aggregate embedding for each global grid cell is then hagg
a,b= (him
a,b,hec
a,b). We will train an ML
regression model to predict building energy use intensity, i.e., ˆya,b=fagg
a,b(hagg
a,b(·)). In addition
to linear and tree-based regression models, we will explore graph neural network based regression
models. We depict this proposed approach in Figure 1. Lastly, for each region, we will calculate an
emissions factor by curating a collection of fuel mixes and fuel-specific emissions factors, as these
characteristics typically do not vary as frequently as building area and energy use intensity.
We will combine these quantities to produce global emissions estimates, comparing our estimates
to top-down models (e.g., GRACED, EDGAR, and ODIAC). While a lack of building emissions
"ground truth" datasets makes validation difficult, we have identified several data sources to use. The
International Energy Agency (IEA), the United Nations, and other bodies create national estimates
of energy consumption including building emissions, but at the time of writing, no comprehensive
dataset exists with measured building energy consumption or resulting emissions at a spatial scale
below that of a nation. However, there are sparse estimates of building consumption at the municipal
level via Data Portal for Cities (DPFC) [ 12], or ad-hoc disclosure by individual regions or buildings.
3 Preliminary Results
To explore our building-area-driven model for estimating building emissions, we use existing public
data to create an early version of our approach. This preliminary effort predicts emissions for three
distinct regions in the world: the United States states of Massachusetts and Michigan and the country
of Mexico, selected as areas for which we have municipality-level ground truth data. Building area
(A) we compute primarily using GHS-sourced global building areas, with some tuning based on
higher-fidelity data from Microsoft building footprints. Energy use intensity (EUI) we compute using
data from CURB [ 13], measured in Joules per square meter. Emissions intensity factors (EF) we
compute primarily via IPCC data [ 14], measured in metric tonnes CO 2e/Joule. Although we are
able to compute estimates at 1 km2resolution using GHS data, we compare aggregated estimates
2This is a 100-fold increase in information content of the estimates over the highest resolution data available,
EDGAR and GRACED; a figure of this difference in resolution is included in the appendix

4 Conclusions and Next Steps
These preliminary results suggest that even before adding in greater complexity through the proposed
approach, our current building-area-driven model is competitive with existing methodologies for
estimating direct residential and commercial building emissions for those municipalities that have
larger total emissions. GRACED and EDGAR tend to perform better in municipalities with fewer
GHG emissions. Since our model performs best in regions where there is high-fidelity building area
data and a strong linear relationship between building area and emissions, we anticipate that improving
our model by introducing additional characteristics related to buildings, population, temperature,
and economics will improve the quality of our emissions estimates. In addition to introducing a
regression-based model training approach for estimation, we also plan to expand the validation data
to municipalities across twelve different countries within DPFC.
5 Pathways to Climate Impact
We expect that our modeling approach will enable high-quality global monthly independent estimates
of residential and commercial building emissions at 1km2resolution. Independent estimates will
guide policy decisions for local and national governments globally. For example, targeted energy
efficiency retrofits require high-resolution information about the buildings that would benefit from
increased energy efficiency and the communities in greatest need of assistance through subsidies or
outreach. The growth of building energy emissions through new construction is a critical characteristic
to monitor and incorporate into the process of sustainable development. This information can be
used to track the impact on regions of new development and how strong the connection is between
economic development, urbanization, and increased building energy consumption. Our model will

5Appendix for High-resolution Global Building Emissions Estimation using Satellite Imagery
A Data To Be Used for Prediction
We will utilize Sentinel-2 as our primary source of satellite imagery, which provides global imagery at
10m/pixel resolution with weekly global coverage. From this we will estimate building area globally,
supplementing sources like the Global Human Settlements (GHS) data which contains building areas,
volumes, and heights in select years at 1km2resolution, globally. Microsoft’s Building Footprints
Dataset [ 17] and Google Open Buildings [ 18] offer building footprint data; however, each covers
select countries with varying degrees of completeness and both lack temporal detail. We will also
consider high-fidelity building emissions datasets available for select cities around the world to use as
model priors. [ 19] Population and wealth data are accessible through datasets such as the WorldPop
gridded population dataset [ 20] and from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators which
will be inputs into the estimation process for energy use intensity. We will also use weather data as
features, which are available globally at high spatial resolution including daily temperature [21].
B Additional Preliminary Results
The additional results shown here are for a simplified version of the model we are proposing that relies
on existing public data sources. As shown previously in Table 1, the Weighted Absolute Percentage
Error (WAPE) metric measures the absolute percentage error between actual and predicted emissions
within a region weighted by the sum of the actual emissions. In this context, WAPE performance
provides insight into a model’s performance as compared to the magnitude of total emissions within
the region; errors in municipalities with fewer total emissions would be penalized less using WAPE
than errors in municipalities with greater total emissions. Because our goal is to prioritize emissions
estimates in regions that have greater overall emissions, WAPE is our preferred choice of metric for
quantifying model performance.
WAPE (R) = 100 ×PN
m=1|Am−Pm|
PN
m=1|Am|
The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric measures the average value of the absolute
percentage error between actual and predicted emissions within a region. In this context, MAPE
performance provides insight into a model’s performance agnostic of the total emissions within a
region, weighting each region equally. Estimation errors in municipalities with fewer total emissions
would be penalized just as heavily as estimation errors in municipalities with greater total emissions.

our model tends to do best in municipalities with larger overall emissions. EDGAR shows a similar
trend, whereas GRACED has far more consistent absolute percentage error independent of emissions
magnitude.

C Spatial resolution comparison
A major difference between past approaches and what we are proposing here is the higher spatial
resolution of the data the proposed method would be able to produce. GRACED and EDGAR
provide estimates at a resolution of 0.1-by-0.1 decimal degrees, which at the equator is approximately
11-by-11 km. By utilizing satellite-derived data sources and a bottom-up approach to modeling, the
proposed approach would be able to provide estimates at a 1-by-1 km, which provides nearly 100
times the number of estimates for the same area greatly increasing the level of detail that can be used
to more accurately resolve emissions to individual municipalities and neighborhoods. This difference
is shown in Figure 3.
