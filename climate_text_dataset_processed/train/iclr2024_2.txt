Abstract
Measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) inexpensively and accurately is crucial
for soil health monitoring and agricultural decarbonization. Hyperspectral
imaging is commonly evaluated as an inexpensive alternative to dry combus-
tion for SOC measurement, but existing end-to-end approaches trained to
predict SOC content from spectral data frequently fail to generalize when
applied outside of their ground-truth geographic sampling distributions.
Using stratified data from the USDA Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA), we
demonstrate a method to improve model generalization out-of-distribution
by training SOC regression alongside models that reconstruct input spec-
tra. Because hyperspectra can be collected from remote platforms such as
drones and satellites, this approach raises the possibility of using large hy-
perspectral Earth observation datasets to transfer SOC inference models to
remote geographies where geographically-dense ground-truth data collection
may be expensive or impossible. By replacing the decoder with a simple
physics-informed model, we also learn an interpretable spectral signature of
SOC, confirming its dark hue and expected reflectance troughs. Finally, we
show that catastrophic generalization failures can be better addressed with
these architectures by fine-tuning on large quantities of hyperspectral data.
1 Introduction
Modern intensive agriculture yields direct greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption,
fertilizer production, livestock husbandry, and land use change, accounting for roughly 20% of
global anthropogenic contributions to climate change ( 1). An avenue of significant interest to
decarbonize agriculture is to augment organic carbon stored in agricultural soils through local
shifts in farming practices. Approaches that have been tested include zero- or reduced-tillage,
cover cropping, and crop residue utilization ( 2). Such practices can bolster the interactions
of plants’ root systems with bugs and microorganisms, leading to increased deposition of
carbon from the atmosphere into soil ( 2;3;4). However, measurements to verify that these
sustainable practices have their intended effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are
prohibitively expensive to apply to large areas of land ( ∼$15-25 USD/sample) ( 5;6). These
steep costs have motivated investigation into more scalable approaches for SOC inference.
In this work, we investigate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) as a candidate procedure to scale
SOC measurement. The standard technique to measure SOC content requires combusting
soil to determine its total carbon content, and mixing it with acid to determine its inorganic
carbon content (stored in the form of carbonate minerals). SOC is the difference between
these quantities ( 7). Relative to this laboratory procedure, HSI is non-destructive, reagent-
free, emissions-free, and may be performed in situor remotely, via drone or satellite ( 8).
However, existing analyses involve end-to-end regression between measured spectra and
laboratory SOC measurements which, as we show in this work, can drastically fail when

R(λ)is used to predict endmember mass fractions ⃗ mvia a differentiable process (here, a

approach, the decoder model is replaced by an ANN using ˆmi,kas input features.
applied outside of their sampling distributions (OOD) (see appendix A for related work).
Such inabilities to generalize undermine the feasibility of applying HSI to SOC measurement.
Methods to reliably transfer SOC inference models based on HSI data, i.e. requiring minimal
combustion data, are thus of major interest. We demonstrate how to better achieve this goal
by training models for SOC measurement alongside models which reconstruct the original
input spectrum. A major benefit of our approach is that it permits training models using
hyperspectral data alone, which may enable the global scaling of SOC measurement via HSI
thanks to emerging capabilities in continuous hyperspectral Earth observation (9; 10).
We present 3 novel contributions: (1) A method for soil property analysis which uses spectral
reconstruction as an auxiliary loss to enable the use of unlabeled data during training; (2)
An application of this architecture which backs out an interpretable reference spectrum for
SOC using physical priors; and (3) a replicable empirical study using a cleaned dataset,
which demonstrates the failure of SOC inference models to predict OOD, and shows how our
method enables improvements in generalization performance.
2 Method
In this work, we analyze a large library of soil carbon contents and soil reflectances. The
SOC content of sample iis represented as a fraction mi,SOC, and its reflectance as a vector
overMwavelengths: Ri(λj), with j= 1, . . . , M. Our objective is to estimate the % by mass
of SOC ˆmi,SOCin a given sample of soil iusing only Ri. We refer to the model trained to
solve this task as the encoder model E[Ri(⃗λ)] = ˆmi,SOC. We then couple Eto a decoder
model Dwhich solves the inverse inference problem: D
E[Ri(⃗λ)]
=ˆRi(⃗λ). We include K−1
auxiliary variables in the output space of the encoder model, ˆm1, . . . , ˆmK−1, so that the

square error (RMSE), R2, and mean bias ⟨ˆmi,SOC−mi,SOC⟩. To evaluate the performance
ofD, we use the mean RMSE per reconstructed spectrum, which we denote MRMSE.
We analyzed soil spectral data from the USDA Rapid Carbon Assessment Project
(RaCA) ( 11), a campaign which stratified the conterminous United States into 17 dis-
joint regions based on major land resource area (MLRA) and land use land cover (LULC)
classifications (see Figure 2). Hyperspectral scans were performed on over 120,000 sam-

ples collected from soil cores (or pedons) taken from those regions using an ASD LabSpec
spectrophotometer at 1 nm resolution within the Visible-Near Infrared (Vis-NIR) spectral
window of 350-2500 nm. Prior to scanning, each soil sample was air-dried, ground, and
sieved to a particle size below 2 mm. A representative fraction of the samples was sent
to a laboratory for total carbon measurement (via dry combustion) and carbonate content
measurement (via the modified pressure calcimeter method). Organic carbon was computed
as (total carbon) −(inorganic carbon). We identified 23,291 unique pairs of spectral data
and SOC content. We removed one outlier with high water content (48% by mass) as well
as 40 spectra where the ASD spectrophotometer failed to log reflectances for one or more
wavelengths. Due to frequent pixel failures at lower wavelengths, we removed reflectance
data below 365 nm. Following selection cuts, we obtain 23,550 soil spectra within a spectral
window of 365-2500 nm, alongside laboratory-measured SOC content.
In part of our analysis, we used a physics-informed model in place of D(see appendix B for
details) with 2,152 parameters, including the spectrum of pure SOC fSOC(λj)and a nuisance
parameter (ρ·r)SOC. To construct this model, we used 93 characteristic spectra from the
United States Geological Survey Spectral Library ( 12) corresponding to minerals commonly
found in soils. Relevant mineral properties such as density, unit cell size, and commonality in
soils were scraped from textbook sources ( 13) and the Mindat.org mineralogical database ( 14).
With this dataset, we have M=2,136 and K= 94. The loss function is taken as:

where N̸=N′in general. Here ˆmi,SOC,ˆRi(λj)∈[0,1]. We take σi,SOC = 0.0041(15;16)
andσASD(λj) = 0 .01. The artificial neural network (ANN) encoder in Figure 1 has H= 512
with 1,944,360 parameters. The ANN decoder model has a similar size (take M↔K
in Figure 1 and replace SoftMax with Sigmoid). For the physics-informed decoder model,
fSOC(λj)is initialized to 0.5, and (ρ·r)SOCis set to the mean (ρ·r)for mineral endmembers.
3 Experiment
We investigated 3 points for 3 architectures: no decoder ( N′= 0), ANN decoder, and
physics-informed decoder (both with N′≥N). In Experiment 1, we quantified the OOD
performance of SOC content regression under worst case conditions, when the validation
data comes from a distinct land class. In Experiment 2, we analyzed the regressed values of
fSOC(λj)in the physics-informed decoder model trainings of Experiment 1 for interpretable
properties matching observations in the literature. Lastly, in Experiment 3 we tested whether
the burden of ground-truth SOC data collection could be reduced via transfer learning, by
fine-tuning pretrained models on OOD spectral data. (See appendix C for tabulated results.)
Experiment 1: Does failure to perform spectral reconstruction signal generalization failure?
In each of 4 runs fixing random seeds, we compared 17 trainings of 1,000 epochs on a dataset

comprised of 16 out of 17 RaCA regions, with one region left as validation. For architectures
with decoders, we had N′=N. Regions 3, 5, 6, 8, 16, and 18 demonstrated catastrophically
poor generalization performance, with validation R2<0for all models. The remaining
11 regions had R2>0on the validation set in the vast majority of cases. No significant
difference was found between the average encoder performance of the 3 models. However, for
the ANN decoder the validation MRMSE was (3.358±0.179)%on average for the experiments
which generalized, whereas that of the 6 problematic regions was (4.984±0.338)%. Per a
two-tailed Welch’s t-test, this is a statistically significant difference in performance ( t= 4.681,
p <0.0001). The same observations held in the physics-informed case ( t= 4.789, p < 0.0001).
Takeaway: These results provide evidence that poor spectral reconstruction in a given
geography can signal OOD generalization failure without the use of combustion data.
Experiment 2: Is the regressed spectrum of SOC physically interpretable?
Since SOC is not a single compound, and is not fully separable from soil, the optical
spectrum of “pure” SOC cannot be determined from laboratory methods ( 7). However, our
approach enables regression of this unknown via the physics-informed decoder model. For the
trainings in Experiment 1, we found (ρ·r)SOC= 2.471±0.132mg m−2. Figure 3 depicts the
regressed fSOC(λj), demonstrating their variability due to changes in the geographic sampling
distribution. These spectra collectively confirm long-standing observations regarding SOC
in the literature: the Munsell color is black ( 8), and it has reflectance troughs noted in e.g.
figure 2 of ( 17) (red lines in figure 3). The troughs near 1400 and 1900 nm are likely due to
the presence of trapped moisture ( 18;19). That near 2500 nm is attributed to both humic
acid (an extractible component of SOC) ( 18) and calcium carbonate ( 20), suggesting that
the model may not perfectly distinguish SOC from one or more sources of inorganic carbon.
Takeaway: The physics-informed decoder model reverse-engineers known properties of SOC.
Experiment 3: Can a surplus of HSI data improve scale-up of SOC inference?
To demonstrate the benefit of HSI’s ease of application relative to laboratory methods, we
trained on a small subset of ground-truth combustion data ( ∼5%) alongside the complete set
of hyperspectral scans, to compare architectures in the more realistic regime where N′≫N.
First, we selected 10 pedons at random from each RaCA region. In each comparison, we
set aside one RaCA region as a validation dataset. For training, we combined combustion
data for all 160 pedons of the remaining 16 regions with the reflectances of all samples
in those regions. We trained for 500 epochs. From the validation region, we selected 5
pedons at random and combined their combustion data with the full set of reflectances for
the validation region. We fine-tuned on this dataset for 25 epochs. We repeated the full
experiment over 4 fixed random seeds. After initial training, we found an average validation
R2<0for all architectures, with no significant performance differences across architectures.
After fine-tuning, only the models with ANN decoders demonstrated R2values significantly
larger than 0 on the validation set ( 0.210±0.068). While we observed generally poor model
performance in this regime (likely due to the small size of the training and fine-tuning
datasets), these results demonstrate a clear use case for our approach, and motivate further
analysis. Takeaway: Our approach can better support the transfer of SOC models to local
conditions when much more HSI data are available for analysis than combustion data.

A Related Work
A significant body of work, spanning decades, has applied HSI to the task of soil property
inference ( 8;21;22;23). Measurements of interest include soil moisture, pH, and nutrient
contents such as organic carbon, nitrogen, and potassium content ( 17). Prior to the advent
of machine learning, and still in recent years, common analysis methods have included
generalizations of linear regression techniques such as partial least squares regression (PLSR)
and Cubist models ( 24;25). The most common metrics of performance include root mean
square error (RMSE), mean bias, and correlation coefficients R2between measurements and
predictions.
In one of the first works performing end-to-end regression analysis on the RaCA dataset ( 26),
the same dataset used in our analysis, the authors compared PLSR against artificial neural
networks (ANNs), finding superior performance with the ANN. Using a 60:40 training-
validation split over the full dataset, they achieved an RMSE of 3.59%,R2= 0.96(training),
and an RMSE of 3.61%,R2= 0.96(validation). As the goal of the study was to develop
algorithms useful for carbon stock assessment of the conterminous United States, leave-one-
region-out cross-validation was not performed; there was no emphasis on the generalization
of trained models outside of the geographic sampling distribution.
More recent efforts have focused on optimizing local model development for SOC prediction
utilizing large soil spectral libraries (SSLs). In ( 27), the authors train ANNs to predict SOC
content using the LUCAS database, but with an emphasis on out-of-distribution transfer
of results. They demonstrate that the use of an ANN pre-trained on a global SSL and
subsequently fine-tuned on local data performed better than local models in 91% of cases,
with an average reduction in RMSE on the order of 10%. More recently, the authors of ( 28)
extended this approach on 1D CNNs, weighing the benefit of transferring pre-trained model
weights versus instance data from SSLs when developing local models. They found that
transferring instance data directly led to the most consistent improvement, an average
reduction in RMSE of 25.8% compared with local modeling. However, in these studies,
no attempt was made to simultaneously solve the inverse inference problem, i.e. using
regressed soil properties such as SOC to reconstruct the original input spectrum. This
means that transfer learning techniques will still require large soil spectral libraries to be
developed which contain paired combinations of spectra and ground-truth SOC data. In this
work, we demonstrate how training a model to solve the forward problem (SOC estimation)
alongside the inverse problem (spectral reconstruction) improves the efficacy of transfer
learning techniques for SOC estimation without necessitating the collection of expensive
label data from laboratory combustion analysis.
There is active interest in applying HSI to soil property inference within other spectral ranges,
such as MIR (mid-infrared, 2,500-25,000 nm) ( 29;30;31), and also in combination with
proximal measurement devices such as penetrometers ( 32;33). In this work, we focused on
Vis-NIR spectroscopy because it presents the greatest immediate opportunity to scale global
soil data collection and calibrate universal models for soil property inference, using only
those input features which can be accessed remotely, such as from a drone- or satellite-borne

platform. Existing and planned hyperspectral satellites utilize sensors calibrated to the
Vis-NIR spectral window ( 9;10). The experiments we perform in this work are designed
to be deployed, with the objective of scaling SOC inference to regions where geographic
stratification of soil classes is possible but direct sampling is expensive. The methodology
presented here can enable the utilization of emerging capabilities in continuous hyperspectral
Earth observation in order to transfer models for soil property inference to new environments
and geographies.
B Physics-informed model: motivation and assumptions
The implementation of the decoder network Dpresents an opportunity to regress spectral
features of SOC which are not otherwise accessible through laboratory methods. Taking
the latent space ⃗ mto represent mass fractions of well-characterized soil components, or
endmembers, then Dmay be interpreted as reconstructing the spectrum of the admixture
of those components, including SOC. A physics-informed approach to this spectral mixing
generically requires synthesizing the spectra for pure samples of each endmember. However,
known methodologies to isolate organic compounds from soil are inherently destructive ( 34),
so it is not possible to perform a spectral scan of “pure” SOC. At the same time, SOC does
not have a unique chemical structure, but rather is an amalgamation of organic compounds
present in soil whose distribution is sensitive to multiple local sources of variation, such as
vegetation types or average soil temperature and moisture ( 4). A tool to extract the spectral
fingerprint of SOC appropriate to a given region can be used as a diagnostic, to analyze post
factowhy a trained model for soil property inference may have failed to generalize.
In part of this work, we considered the case where an end-to-end decoder model is replaced
by a physics-informed linear mixing model, combining known soil endmember signatures
in a weighted average to reconstruct the input soil spectra while regressing the spectral
signature of SOC. While many approaches exist to perform spectral mixing, the linear case
is the simplest, and is a common sub-component of more sophisticated techniques ( 35). We
model the reflectance of a given soil sample Ri(λj)in terms of the spectra fk(λj)of pure
endmember samples as:
ˆRi(λj) =KX
k=1αi,k·fk(λj), α i,k=ˆmi,k
ρk·rkPK
ℓ=1ˆmi,ℓ
ρℓ·rℓ(2)
wherePK
k=1αi,k= 1. We note that αi,k̸=ˆmi,k. Preserving physical interpretability of the
model parameters requires a unit conversion factor, since combustion measurements reflect
percentages by mass, whereas reflectance measurements relate to the area of the reflective
surface attributable to a given endmember. Per dimensional analysis, we perform a weighted
average by ρk·rk, where ρkis the density of endmember kandrk≡V1/3is its characteristic
length scale computed from the unit cell volume V. The M+ 1 =2,152 parameters of this
decoder should be interpreted as modeled characteristics of pure SOC: both its spectral
fingerprint fSOC(λj)and its corresponding size factor (ρ·r)SOC.
To understand the effect of the assumptions introduced to maintain the physical inter-
pretability of model parameters, we ran the same experiments, but disabling the latent
space conversion (equivalent to taking all ρk·rk→1orαi,k→ˆmi,k). This did not lead
to a significant change in performance; it effectively rescaled the regressed values of fSOC
by an overall multiplicative factor. Qualitative observations regarding fSOCwere likewise
unaffected.
