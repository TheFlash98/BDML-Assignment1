ABSTRACT
The Environmental Extended Multi-regional Input-Output analysis is the predom-
inant Ecological Economic research framework for analysing the environmental
impact of economic activities. This paper introduces the novel ExioML dataset as
the first Machine Learning benchmark data in sustainability analysis. We open-
sourced the ExioML data and development toolkit to lower barriers and accel-
erate the cooperation between Machine Learning and Ecological Economic re-
search. A crucial greenhouse gas emission regression task evaluates the usabil-
ity of the proposed dataset. We compared the performance of traditional shal-
low models against deep models by leveraging a diverse factor accounting table
and incorporating multiple modalities of categorical and numerical features. Our
findings reveal that deep and ensemble models achieve low mean square errors
below 0.25 and serve as a future machine learning research baseline. Through Ex-
ioML, we aim to foster precise ML predictions and modelling to support climate
actions and sustainable investment decisions. The data and codes are available:

1 I NTRODUCTION
The increase in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions due to fossil-fuel-driven economic development
has precipitated a global warming crisis. This concern led to establishing the Paris Agreement in
2015, aiming to limit long-term temperature rise to no more than 2◦C above pre-industrial levels
(Schleussner et al., 2016). Concurrently, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were pro-
posed to emphasize poverty eradication within the framework of emission reductions (Bruckner
et al., 2022; Hubacek et al., 2017). To address the climate-trade dilemma, researchers from various
disciplines strive to balance climate action with economic growth and human well-being (Rao et al.,
2014; Jorgenson, 2014). Recently, the Machine Learning (ML) technique (LeCun et al., 2015) has
emerged as a significant tool for accurate prediction to assist climate change decision-making (Rol-
nick et al., 2022). Specifically, ML algorithms have been explored in aiding nearly real-time global
weather forecasting (Lam et al., 2023), land monitoring via satellite imagery (Stanimirova et al.,
2023; He et al., 2016), and the prediction of disturbances in electric grids (Zheng et al., 2022).
The predominant Ecological Economic (EE) research framework, the Environmentally Extended
Multiregional Input-Output (EE-MRIO) analysis, effectively models global economic interactions
of sectors within a network structure (Leontief & Strout, 1963; Wang et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020a;
Steinberger et al., 2012; Jakob & Marschinski, 2013). However, a research gap exists between
Ecological Economic and Machine Learning (EE-ML) cooperation, which can be summarised in
three ways. The inaccessibility of the EE-MRIO dataset, the intensive data preprocessing required
domain knowledge and the lack of Benchmark ML datasets and models.
We proposed ExioM as the first ML-ready benchmark data in EE research to fill these gaps. The
ExioML is developed on top of the high-quality open-source EE-MRIO dataset ExioBase 3.8.2 with
high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling tracking resource flow between international sectors for
global sectoral sustainability assessment. The ExioML developing toolkit is open-sourced, provides
EE-MRIO calculation tools with GPU acceleration, and contributes to the high flexibility of cus-
tomising interested factors, which reduces the barrier for ML researchers. The usability of the Ex-
1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024
ioML dataset was validated using multimodality regression to quantify the sectoral GHG emission,
and a low MSE result was achieved. This establishes a critical baseline for accuracy and efficiency
in future ML research.
2 L ITERATURE REVIEW
EE-MRIO describes the environmental footprint for global economic activities and has become the
fundamental framework for EE research, supporting various studies such as Structure Decomposi-
tion Analysis (SDA) and Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) to identify changes by decomposing
key drivers (Hoekstra & Van den Bergh, 2003; Peters et al., 2017; Duan & Yan, 2019). Monitor em-
bodied emissions with resource transfer and sustainability evaluation of supply chain in global trade
(Meng et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2020; He & Hertwich, 2019; Li et al., 2020; Long
et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2020a). ML algorithms have been applied with EE-MRIO for several applica-
tions, such as accurately identifying ecological hotspots and inefficiencies within the global supply
chain to optimise logistic paths to decrease carbon emissions while considering cost-effectiveness
(Akbari & Do, 2021). ML algorithms are naturally suitable for learning multi-dimensional patterns
and are utilised for better sectoral sustainability assessment considering environmental, economic
and social impacts (Abdella et al., 2020; Nilashi et al., 2019). Decomposition algorithms are lever-
aged to track the critical paths of products’ energy, water, and emission footprints from giant trading
networks for supporting sustainable investment decisions (Ding et al., 2022).
However, unlike the open-source culture of the mainstream ML community (Zheng et al., 2022),
most EE studies haven’t publicised the code and data. This leads to fragmented, independent, and
inconsistent research leveraging ML techniques to explore the sustainability of different sectors
and regions. Subsequent research cannot fairly compare the model performance, such as accuracy,
robustness, and generalisation or reproduce the result based on previous research, leading to the
slow EE-ML development (Zhu et al., 2023; Ballarin et al., 2023; Nangini et al., 2019).
No public benchmark EE-ML dataset is available to the best of our knowledge. The EE-MRIO data
is a high-quality source for constructing ML-ready datasets. However, the existing EE-MRIO dataset
faces limitations in terms of accessibility and resolution. Specifically, Eora offers high-quality data
but is closed-source and requires high-cost purchasing (Lenzen et al., 2013). Global Trade Analysis
Project (GTAP) covers only five reference time steps with non-free access (Chepeliev, 2023). The
World Input-Output Database (WIOD) (Dietzenbacher et al., 2013) questioned the low resolution
of temporal and spatial scope, whose latest temporal coverage is 2016. Therefore, uniform problem
formulations and benchmark datasets need to be urgently developed.
3 E XIOML D ATA AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLKIT
ExioML is constructed as the first benchmark dataset in EE-ML research. The architecture of the
proposed dataset is illustrated in Figure 1. ExioML addressed the challenges of data limitation and
simplified the EE-MRIO framework for ML researchers in a ready-to-use manner. ExioML offers
high spatiotemporal resolution for 49 regions from 1995 to 2022 contains tabular and graphical
formats, supporting diverse ML research, such as time-series emissions forecasting (Deb et al.,
2017), factor analysis (Raihan et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2019; Duan & Yan, 2019; Acheampong &
Boateng, 2019; Khan et al., 2020), graph learning (Sun et al., 2020b) and clustering analysis (He
et al., 2022; Kijewska & Bluszcz, 2016), under a uniform framework. The details of ExioML are
summarised in Tablue 1.

Figure 1: Architecture of ExioML system derived from the open-source EE-MRIO database, Ex-
ioBase 3.8.2. Each colour indicates an eco-economic factor: value added, employment, energy
consumption and GHG emission. The system contains factor accounting data describing heteroge-
neous sector features. The footprint network models the global trading network tracking resource
transfer within sectors. The data is presented into 2 categories: 200 products and 163 industries for
49 regions from 1995 to 2022 in the PxP and IxI datasets.
ExioML is derived from an open-source EE-MRIO dataset, ExioBase 3.8.2 (Stadler et al., 2018)
and leveraged Pymrio (Stadler, 2021), a Python-based MRIO toolkit to facilitate data download and
basic MRIO operations. ExioBase 3.8.2 is a comprehensive source database covering 417 emission
categories and 662 material and resource categories occupying over 40 GB of storage. Intensive
data preprocessing, such as heavy data cleaning, structure transformation, and footprint network
calculation, is required to transfer the row data into a standardized ML paradigm. Here are the
construction details of the ExioML database that utilises the MRIO framework. Initially, the column
vector xsymbolizes the global economy’s output, with each element xrrepresenting the total output
of region r. This could be determined by transaction matrix Zand demand matrix Y:

x1
x2
...
xm
=
Z11Z12··· Z1n

............
Zm1Zm2··· Zmn
+
P
sy1sP

. (1)
Zindicates the transaction matrix for nsectors in mregions, and Zrsis the inter-regional require-
ment from region rto region s.yrsis the final demand from region rto region s.
Then, the direct requirement matrix A, indicative of technological efficiency, is derived by multiply-
ing the transaction matrix Zwith the diagonalized, inverted vector ˆx−1:
A=Zˆx−1. (2)
Further, the economy’s output vector Xis expressible via the Leontief matrix L:
X= (I−A)−1y=Ly. (3)

This framework can incorporate environmental accounting, such as energy consumption and green-
house gas (GHG) emissions, with the factor represented by F. The coefficient Snormalizes this
factor against the output x:
S=Fˆx−1. (4)
Finally, the footprint flow networks Dcould be determined by:
D=SLy. (5)
We open-sourced the well-documented ExioML development toolkit to stimulate interdisciplinary
corporations in three contributions. Firstly, the toolkit reduces the barrier for new ML researchers
without EE domain knowledge by encapsulating a complex MRIO framework. Secondly, data stor-
age and computational demands for the EE-MRIO dataset are substantial due to high-dimensional
matrix operations. ExioML development toolkit utilises GPU accelerations and elegantly stores
multi-dimensional networks in edge tables. Thirdly, the toolkit benefits later researchers with high-
level flexibility to customise the factors of interest. MRIO features contain specific eco-economic
meanings, such as scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Independent features should be carefully selected.
To achieve that, four essential factors interested by the EE research community, which are emis-
sions ( F), population ( P), GDP ( G), and energy consumption ( E) indicated by the Kaya Identity
(Gonz ´alez-Torres et al., 2021) are selected:
F=P×G
P×E
G×F
E. (6)
The factors included in ExioML are detailed in Table 2. ExioML comprises two pivotal elements.
Firstly, factor accounting, presented in a tabular format, delineates heterogeneous characteristics
of various sectors, a subset of the emission extension table with selected factors from ExioBase.
Secondly, the footprint network, a multivariate time-series network, describes the transfer of the
resource footprints among sectors. Each element is divided into two categories: The product-by-
product (PxP) dataset encompasses 200 products, and the industry-by-industry (IxI) dataset covers
163 industries, crossing 49 regions spanning 1995 to 2022.

4 V ALIDATION
Our study demonstrates a multimodel sectoral GHG emissions regression task leveraging categorical
and numerical features to validate the usability of the proposed ExioML. The model aims to learn
the underlying relationships of eco-economic factors to quantify sectoral GHG emission and assess
sectoral sustainability using the factor accounting in the ExioML dataset (Sun & Huang, 2022).
The supervised regression task is to learn the mapping function fθ:X7→Yfrom feature vector
xi∈Xto labels yi∈Yon dataset D={(x1, y1), ...,(xn, yn)}. In this case, ee utilized the
PxP and IxI as dataset Dof ExioML’s factor accounting, comprising 221,307 and 179,185 instances
after excluding missing values, respectively. The feature vector Xis value-added, employment and
energy consumption, and GHG emission is set as the label Y.

Regression models could be categorized into shallow and deep learning models. Deep learning in
eco-economic analysis, particularly on tabular data, remains relatively underexplored (Gorishniy
et al., 2021). We rigorously evaluated different algorithms on tabular learning algorithms, including
tree-based models, MLP and Transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017). Shallow models
employ Leave-One-Out Text Encoding due to their inability to process categorical data natively
(Zhang, 2016), whereas deep learning models learn categorical embeddings directly from raw data
are implemented by PyTorch Tabular package (Joseph, 2021).
5 R ESULTS
This analysis assessed each model based on its MSE and training time. To ensure unbiased evalua-
tion and prevent leakage of target information, the dataset was partitioned into training, validation,
and testing sets with proportions of 64%, 16% and 20%. Optimal model parameters were determined
through a random search across 30 trials on the training and validation data. We conducted 10 exper-
iments for each tuned hyperparameter with their performance on the test set. Detailed information
regarding the model, implementation, and hyperparameters can be found in the Appendix.
Table 3 summarized the model’s mean performance and standard deviation. The primary finding is
that deep learning models exhibit marginally lower mean squared errors than ensemble counterparts.
GANDALF shows the most effective performance in PxP and IxI data. Ensemble methods, GBDT
and RF, emerge with competitive accuracy and less demand for computational resources. Although
deep models benefit from GPU acceleration, their training time is significantly longer than shallow
models. This extended training duration could potentially lead to increased emissions.

6 C ONCLUSION
EE-MRIO framework is a powerful analysis tool in EE research and has been widely discussed for
key factor analysis, sustainability assessment and global supply chain optimisation. ML algorithms
are naturally fit for modelling non-linear complex relationships between multi-dimensional factors.
However, the ML algorithms in the EE field are underdeveloped due to three major challenges.
The inaccessibility of EE-MRIO data, the high domain knowledge requirement to utilise EE-MRIO
framework and the absence of uniformed ML problem setting, benchmark data and algorithms.
This research introduces the first high-quality EE-ML benchmark dataset integrated with the EE-
MRIO framework to address these research gaps. The proposed novel ExioML data and develop-
ment toolkit addressed three significant ML borders in sustainability research. Firstly, ExioML ends
data access limitations and provides high resolution based on the open-source EE-MRIO database,
ExioBase 3.8.2. Secondly, we streamline the complexity of the EE-MRIO framework with the Ex-
ioML development toolkit. It provides MRIO computation with GPU accelerations for high-level
customisation for later researchers. Finally, we demonstrated the evaluation of various machine
learning models on factor accounting datasets focused on sectoral GHG emission prediction through
regression tasks, serving as effective baselines with low mean square error performance. ExioML
simulates the interdisciplinary EE-ML corporation and promotes promising research, such as supply
chain optimization, suitability assessment, and footprint prediction, which contributes to formulat-
ing effective climate policies and sustainable investment decisions.

7.1 EE-MRIO F RAMEWORK
EE-MRIO contains rich information that can be used to track resource and emission flow in global
trading in matrix formation illustrated in Figure 2. EE-MRIO is developed on top of the MRIO
framework with consideration of emission accounting, as known as factor accounting table. The
MRIO table contains an input-output table recording the monetary resource input and output sectoral
dependence, and a demand table describes the final monetary demand of products.
Figure 2: Description of EE-MRIO framework. Multi-regional input-output data tracks the mon-
etary resource transfer of international sectors using the input-output table and demand table. En-
vironmental Extended MRIO considers the environmental impact of economic activities using the
factor accounting table. EE-MRIO data are represented in high-dimensional matrix formation. The
footprint network could be calculated using an IO table, demand table and factor accounting table.
7.2 D ATA STRUCTURE OF EXIOML
ExioML contains factor accounting in a tabular format, and a footprint network in the graph structure
shares four eco-economic drivers. Factor accounting measures sectoral resource usage, as discussed
in the previous section. The footprint network tracks the resource transfer between sectors, and the
details are illustrated in Table 4.

The raw ExioBase 3.8.2 contains rich spatiotemporal information, covering 163 sectors in 49 regions
for 28 years. Therefore, the number of connections for a single factor in one year is 63,792,169,
which consumes vast storage, around 1 GB. ExioML footprint network is a scale-free network, and
the weights of edges are followed by power-law distribution (Foster, 2005). Most of the connections
are insignificant, around zero. The overall network is sparse, and the connections are concentrated
to dominant nodes. To store the multi-dimensional network in a single file, we melt the graph
adjacency matrix into an edge table in tabular format. We take the top 1,000,000 connections each
year. Around 300,000 edges each year are left after performing inner-join with the selected factors.
The total storage consumption for the PxP and IxI footprint network are 1.43 GB and 1.34 GB,
respectively.
7.3 D ISTRIBUTION AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS FOR FACTOR ACCOUNT
The inherent skewness in eco-economic data presents a significant challenge for analysis. To address
this, employing log-transformation or scaling methods is a critical step in data preprocessing for
effective machine learning modelling. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of numerical features,
while Figure 4 depicts the correlation coefficients between variables. An analysis of these figures
reveals a strong positive linear Pearson correlation among value added, employment, energy, and
emissions. In contrast, feature year demonstrates a lower positive correlation with the other features.

7.4 I MPLETEMENT DETAILS
Algorithms included in GHG emission regression are as follows:
•K-Nearnest-Neighbour (KNN): This non-parametric method predicts based on the ma-
jority vote from its k nearest neighbours (Cover & Hart, 1967).
11Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024
•Ridge Regression: A linear regression variant employing ℓ2regularization to prevent over-
fitting (Hoerl & Kennard, 1970).
•Decision Tree (DT): A feature splitting algorithm to tree flowchart structure for decision
making (Quinlan, 1986).
•Random Forest (RF): Ensemble of multiple decision trees for robust prediction (Breiman,
2001).
•Grandient Boost Decision Tree (DBDT): Ensemble weak trees to improve the error of
the previous tree sequentially (Friedman, 2001).
•Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A deep artificial neural network employing backpropa-
gation with the capability of non-linear function approximation (LeCun et al., 2015).
•Gated Adaptive Network (GANDALF): GANDALF leverages Gated Feature Learning
Units (GFLU) for automated feature selection (Joseph & Raj, 2022).
•Feature-Tokenizer Transformer (FTT): Novel transformer architecture applies a tok-
enization mechanism on tabular features (Gorishniy et al., 2021).
The experimental procedures are outlined in Table 5. We divided the data into training, valida-
tion, and test sets and applied log transformation for distribution scaling. Shallow models used
Leave-one-out Encoding for categorical features. Data normalization was employed for DL mod-
els to ensure stable training, although this did not significantly enhance performance. In terms of
implementation, we used Sci-Kit Learn for shallow models and PyTorch Tabular for DL models.
The MPS framework trained the deep models on Apple M3 Pro GPUs. Interestingly, based on
our observations, the models performed better when trained on NVIDIA T4 GPUs with the CUDA
framework.

7.5 H YPERPARAMETER TUNING
A random search of hyperparameters was conducted over 30 trials within a defined parameter grid.
The range of parameters tested and the best parameters identified are summarized in Table 6. Given
our limited computational resources and time constraints, this grid was heuristically small and based
on model characteristics and previous studies to optimize efficiency. The tuning process for each
ensemble model took about 10 to 20 minutes per dataset, whereas for each DL model, it took roughly
2 to 3 hours. We plan to include implementing more efficient hyperparameter search algorithms such
as Bayesian Optimisation and increasing the number of trials in future.
