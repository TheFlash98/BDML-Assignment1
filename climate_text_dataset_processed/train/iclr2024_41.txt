Abstract
Prediction problems in geographic information science and transportation
are often motivated by the possibility to enhance operational efficiency and
thereby reduce emissions. Examples range from predicting car sharing de-
mand for relocation planning to forecasting traffic congestion for navigation
purposes. However, conventional accuracy metrics ignore the spatial distribu-
tion of the errors, despite its relevance for operations. Here, we put forward
a spatially aware evaluation metric and loss function based on Optimal
Transport (OT). Our framework leverages partial OT and can minimize relo-
cation costs in any spatial prediction problem. We showcase the advantages
of OT-based evaluation over conventional metrics and further demonstrate
the application of an OT loss function for improving forecasts of bike sharing
demand and charging station occupancy. Thus, our framework not only
aligns with operational considerations, but also signifies a step forward in
refining predictions within geospatial applications. All code is available at

Figure 1: Optimal transport for evaluating spatiotemporal predictions. In contrast to other metrics,
our OT framework takes into account spatial distances and the related costs or emissions (a). In
detail, the costs of prediction errors are quantified in terms of the required resource reallocation,
based on the optimal transportation plan mapping from predictions to ground truth (b).
The transport sector accounts for 20% of CO 2-emissions worldwide (Statista) and thus plays
a key role in climate action. One possible avenue to reducing emissions is the adoption of
on-demand services such as (autonomous) car sharing, which was shown to effectively reduce
car ownership (Mishra et al., 2015; Martin and Shaheen, 2011; Liao et al., 2020). There are
two main research avenues to improving on-demand transport services: Prediction (Nguyen
et al., 2018), e.g., estimating the number of shared cars/bicycles that will be picked up in
the next hour, and optimization, e.g., computing the most efficient way to re-distribute
1Published at Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024
bikes/cars. Importantly, good predictions only lead to a reduction of emissions if the system
is optimized with respect to the predicted demand.
Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) research in geographic information sciences (GIS) or trans-
portation usually treats prediction as a standalone problem, ignoring its role in downstream
tasks (Yan and Wang, 2022). Consider the example of forecasting bike sharing demand per
hour and per station. Usually, a time series prediction model such as an LSTM is trained
on the data and the prediction quality is evaluated via the mean squared error (MSE) or
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (Hulot et al., 2018; Brahimi et al., 2022; Shin et al.,
2020; Ma and Faye, 2022), since evaluating the resulting CO 2-efficiency or business costs
is cumbersome. Crucially, such metrics only quantify the error per time step and station,
but ignore the spatial distribution of residuals and their implications in a production setting
involving relocation costs, as illustrated in Figure 1a. Critically, these costs depend on the
distance between erroneous predictions and can be viewed either as a resource relocation or
as auserrelocation that is necessary due to prediction errors.
We propose Optimal Transport (OT) to approximate and minimize relocation costs and
thereby the involved emissions. OT provides methods to measure the disparity between two
(probability) distributions, which can be leveraged as an evaluation framework comparing
the real and predicted spatial distribution in any spatiotemporal prediction task, such as
estimating bike sharing demand, traffic congestion or charging station occupancy. Moreover,
we demonstrate how the relocation costs can be directly minimized with an OT-based loss
function. Our framework is based on partial OT (Guittet, 2002; Piccoli and Rossi, 2014;
Maas et al., 2015) and provides important tools to researchers and industry working with
spatiotemporal data to achieve actual advances in resource management and operational
efficiency with ML methods.
2 Methods
2.1 Optimal transport for evaluating spatiotemporal predictions
Optimal Transport dates back to 1781, when Gaspard Monge pondered on the following
question: Given a pile of earth, what is the most efficient way to redistribute it to a desired
shape (Monge, 1781)? Originally termed Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) and later generalized
to Optimal Transport (OT) theory (Tolstoi, 1930; Cook et al., 1998), this field is concerned
withquantifyingthedivergencebetweentwodistributionsintermsofthelowestcostnecessary
to transport the initial to the target distribution. The first efficient solution approach only
became available with the introduction of linear programming (LP) (Villani, 2021). OT
recently found extensive application in ML research (Peyré et al., 2019; Khamis et al., 2023)
due to its ability to measure the divergence between two probability distributions with the
Wasserstein distance (Vaserstein, 1969; Kantorovich, 1960), as well as due to important speed-
ups in approximating the optimal transportation plan with the Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi,
2013).
In this work, we apply OT to evaluate spatiotemporal predictions at discrete locations.
This setting allows to define the EMD between signatures : Given a fixed set of locations
li, i∈[1..n], letPandQdescribe the initial and the desired spatial distribution of mass
respectively, where piis the initial mass at liandqithe corresponding target mass. For
instance, picould be the car sharing demand at li. With OT, the minimal transportation
costs for re-distributing the mass from Pto match the distribution in Qis computed, based
on a given cost matrix C. We first consider balanced OT assumingP
ipi=P
iqi. The EMD
is computed by solving a linear program (LP) with the following objective and constraints:

inX
jTijCijs.t. T ij≥0∀i, j∈[1...n],nX
j=1Tij=pi∀i,nX
i=1Tij=qj∀j
where Tis the transportation plan to be optimized. The solution of the LP, T∗
ij, indicates
how much mass should be transported from the i-th to the j-th location, with the constraints
ensuring that the marginals of T∗correspond to PandQrespectively. Cijis the cost for one
unit of mass to be moved from litolj. In the simplest case, Cis set to the Euclidean distance
2Published at Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024
between the locations defined by two-dimensional geographic coordinates li= (ui, vi), such
that Cij=p
(ui−uj)2+ (vi−vj)2. However, Ccould also express monetary costs, map-
matched driving distances, or CO 2-emissions. We define EOT(P, Q)as the minimal total
cost for transporting all mass from PtoQbased on the optimal transportation plan T∗:
EOT(P, Q) =nX
i=1nX
j=1CijT∗
ij (1)
To apply OT for evaluating spatio-temporal predictions, we compute the minimal transporta-
tion cost EOT(ˆYt, Yt)between the predicted spatial distribution ˆYt={ˆyt
1, . . . , ˆyt
n}and the
true distribution Yt={yt
1, . . . , yt
n}over all locations at time t. For the sake of simplicity,
we omit the time indices tin the following. The approach is shown in Figure 1b.
2.2 Partial Optimal Transport to consider the total prediction error
The standard formulation of OT assumes the total mass of PandQto be equal, which is
unlikely if Pcontains predictions for Q. An alternative is partial OT (Guittet, 2002; Piccoli
andRossi,2014;Maasetal.,2015). InpartialOT,so-called“dustbin”(Sarlinetal.,2020;Dang
et al., 2020) or “waste vectors” (Guittet, 2002) are added to CandT, allowing mass to vanish
or to emerge with a certain cost; here denoted ϕ. Fortunately, the partial OT problem can
be reduced to balanced OT by modifying the inputs. Specifically, let eC(ϕ)∈R(n+1)×(n+1)
be the resulting cost matrix when enlarging Cby one column and one row both filled
with ϕ. Furthermore, let δdenote the total mass difference δ=P
iqi−P
ipi. We define
eP∈Rn+1by extending Pwithepn+1=max(δ,0)andeQanalogously with eqn+1=max(δ,0).
By design, the total masses of ePandeQare equal. The partial OT error is then simply
Eϕ
POT(P, Q, C ) =EOT(eP,eQ,eC(ϕ)). For a full definition of the variables, see Appendix A.
In our evaluation framework, EPOTcan be seen as a combination of the total error over all
locations and the distributional error due to the required relocation between locations. The
smaller ϕ, the more focus lies on the distributional errors.
2.3 OT-based loss functions to improve spatiotemporal predictions
A natural progression for the OT error as an evaluation criterion is its integration into
thetraining of neural networks as a spatial loss function. However, computing the EMD
requires solving an LP and is not differentiable. Entropy-regularized OT and the Sinkhorn
algorithm (Cuturi, 2013) enabled the employment of OT in deep learning applications (Cao
et al., 2021; Genevay et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2019). We implement a Sinkhorn loss function
for spatiotemporal prediction using the the geomloss package (Feydy et al., 2019). The loss
function is plugged into an established time series prediction model, N-HiTS (Challu et al.,
2022), implemented in the dartslibrary (Herzen et al., 2022). While OT has been used for
evaluating spatio-temporal forecasts (Roberts et al., 2017), to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first attempt to improve forecasts of geospatial data with an OT loss function.
3 Comparison of OT-based evaluation with the MSE
We first design a synthetic scenario to demonstrate the benefits of OT in evaluating spatiotem-
poral predictions. Synthetic data is generated by sampling locations randomly from a uniform
distribution l∼U[0,100]and drawing the corresponding labels yfrom a normal distribution
N(10,3). The predictions are simulated with varying spatial imbalance of the residuals, i.e.
over and underestimation of ydependent on their spatial location. Such imbalance is very
common in real data due to spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity (Zhang et al.,
2009). As a simple scenario, the residuals are sampled from different distributions dependent
on the x-coordinate of the location; namely from N(µ, σ)forx < 50andN(−µ, σ)for
x≥50. Figure 2 illustrates our experimental setup with two examples for µ= 0andµ= 1.5
and presents the results for µ∈ {0,0.5,1,1.5}.σwas tuned to keep the average absolute
value of the residuals constant. In contrast to the MSE that can not reflect spatial imbalance,

Figure 2: Intuitively, the costs to align ground truth and predictions are higher if the residuals are
unevenly distributed in space. We construct synthetic data with increasingly unbalanced distribution
(µ= 0: no imbalance - left, µ= 1.5: strong imbalance - right). In contrast to the MSE, the OT
error reflects the increasing spatial costs.
the OT distance increases substantially due to the increased transportation cost between
predicted and real values. In Appendix B, we further show how the OT error relates to
spatial autocorrelation.
4 Minimizing relocation costs with an OT-based loss function
We consider two use cases to demonstrate an OT-based loss function on real data. First, we
utilize a public dataset from the BIXI bike sharing service in Montreal. Prediction errors in
bike sharing demand lead to relocation costs and emissions, which should be reflected in the
loss function. For our experiment, the number of bike pickups at 458 stations is aggregated
by hour and by station following Hulot et al. (2018). As a second case study, we regard the
task of predicting the occupancy of charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs). In this case,
prediction errors lead to relocation costs for drivers of EVs who find the charger occupied. A
suitable dataset was published by Amara-Ouali et al. (2023), providing the charging station
occupancy for 83 stations in France from July 2020 to February 2021 at a granularity of 15
minutes. In both cases, NHiTS models were trained to predict the demand for the next five
time steps, either employing a normal MSE loss or a Sinkhorn loss function. Details on data
preprocessing and model training are provided in Appendix C.
Table 1 presents the results on test data in terms of the MSE, the balanced OT cost (scaling
Yand ˆYto have equal sum), and EPOTwith small and large ϕ(see Appendix D for the
choice of ϕand its effect on EPOT). The cost matrix Cwas set to the Euclidean distance
between stations in km. For example, relocation effort of around 135.7km is required in
total to align the predicted bike sharing demand with the true. As desired, training with an
OT-based loss function decreases the OT costs, with minor effect on the station-wise MSE.
For the charging station case, the total error δis minimized better with the MSE, such that
only EOTdecreases with a Sinkhorn loss, whereas for bike sharing demand prediction, all
OT-based metrics are decreased significantly.

5 Conclusion
This paper proposes to evaluate spatio-temporal predictions with Optimal Transport, high-
lighting its capacity to reflect reductions in operational costs and emissions within predictive
methods. Our experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the value of OT for evalu-
ating and training prediction models. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any
prediction problem where the spatial distribution of the errors matters. A notable limitation
is the computational demand of computing the EMD and the Sinkhorn loss, particularly in
cases involving numerous locations. The potential of OT in GIS and transportation extends
further, such as its extension to the temporal dimension considering relocation across space
andtime.

A Partial OT
Partial OT allows to create or remove mass at a certain cost. For the purpose of designing an
evaluation metric for spatiotemporal predictions, we argue that allavailable mass should be
transported if possible and only the difference between predicted and true values is removed
or added under penalty. The difference corresponds to δ=P
iqi−P
jpj. Thus, we extend
C,PandQas the following:
eC(ϕ) =
c11. . . c 1nϕ
. . ..... . . . . .
cn1. . . c nn ϕ
ϕ . . . ϕ 0


pii≤n
δ i =nandδ >0
0else(3)
˜qj=

qjj≤n
−δ j =nandδ <0
0else(4)
Applying balanced OT on the modified versions of eP,eQandeCyields a transportation matrix
that contains the flow of mass between locations, as well as the outflow or inflow dependent
onδ. It is worth noting that the penalty ϕcould easily be defined in a location-dependent
manner; i.e., penalizing the import / export to some locations more than to others. For
instance, this could be useful when considering predictions of bike sharing demand, where
bikes are re-distributed from a central hub location.
B Relation between OT error and Moran’s I
As shown in Figure 2, the OT costs are naturally higher if the errors are unevenly distributed
in space. This strongly relates to the concept of spatial autocorrelation; one of the most
fundamental concepts in GIS. There are several measures to quantify spatial autocorrelation
in a dataset, with global Moran’s I arguably the most popular one. Moran’s I is defined as:
I=nP
ijwij·Pn
i=1Pn
j=1wij(xi−x)(xj−x)Pn
i=1(xi−x)2(5)
where xiis the i-th observation, xis the mean of all observed values, nis the number of
samples, and wijis the (distance-based) weighting between to points.
We argue that Moran’s I computed on the residuals of a prediction strongly relates to the OT
cost between prediction and ground truth. Indeed, Figure 3 testifies a pronounced correlation
between Moran’s I and the OT loss (Pearson r= 0.93), that is hardly related to the MSE.
C Data preprocessing and training details
The bike sharing dataset was downloaded from Kaggle1and restricted to the period from
15th of April to 15th of November 2014, since the service is closed in winter, leading to large
gaps in the time series across years. Only stations with missing coordinates or maintenance
stations were removed.
The charging station occupancy dataset was published by Amara-Ouali et al. (2023) in the
context of the “Smarter Mobility Data Challenge”. Each charging station has three plugs and
the challenge is to classify the state of each plug as “available”, “charging”, “passive” (plug is
connected to a car that is fully charged) and “other” (out of order). Here, we frame the task
as a regression problem of predicting the fraction of plugs that are occupied, i.e., charging or

of charging stops for owners of electric vehicles.
The data is given at a granularity of 15 minutes from 3rd of July 2020 to 18th of February
2021. The time series is comparably sparse, since a station on average has no plugs in use
61% of the time; one out of three plugs in use by 27%, and only 2.1% where all three plugs
are used. From 2020-10-22 onwards, there is also a considerable number of missing data,
amounting to 8% of missing information on the number of chargers in use. We execute the
preprocessing pipeline2of the winning team of the “Smarter Mobility Data Challenge”, who
employ the exponential moving weighted average to fill missing values. We further removed
stations with no charging activity, leaving 83 charging stations. Finally, we scale all values
by dividing by 3 for training the model.
The N-HiTS model is trained for 100 epochs with early stopping. The learning rate was set
to1e−5. The time series was treated as multivariate data with one variable per bike sharing
station or charging station. A lag of 24 is used to learn daily patterns, and the hour and
weekday are provided as past covariates. The number of stacks in the N-HiTS model was
set to 3. The number of output time steps corresponds to our forecast horizon of five time
steps. For evaluation, we draw 100 samples from the test data (last 10% of the time series)
and predict the next five time steps based on the respectively preceding time series, without
re-training the model. For further implementation details, we refer to our source code.
D Partial OT strikes a balance between evaluating
distributional and total costs
Intuitively, partial OT strikes a balance between balanced OT (measuring the mismatch
between the predicted and true distribution) and the total error δ(mismatch between the
sum of predicted and the sum of observed values). The weighting between both depends on
ϕ. In Table 1, we reported the results for the partial OT error with low ϕ, specifically setting
ϕto the 0.1-quantile of all pairwise costs Cij, and high ϕ, where ϕis set to the maximum of
the cost matrix ϕ=max ijCij. The reasoning of these parameter settings is illustrated in
Figure 4, showing the OT error of the model trained on predicting charging data occupancy
with a Sinkhorn loss. In particular, Figure 4 illustrates the dependence of EPOTonϕ. For

We observe that the EPOTapproximately corresponds to EOTwhen ϕis set to the 0.1-
quantile of C(intersection of green and blue lines in Figure 4). This observation is consistent
for synthetic data as well as the bike sharing dataset. The reason is that with ϕ= 0, only
the spatial distribution would be penalized, but some mass could be imported to / exported
from arbitrary locations for free. Thus, ϕ= 0leads to lower errors than EOT.
On the other hand, for ϕ−→ ∞, all entries of Cbecome zero except for the last row and
column which is 1, since all values are divided by ϕwhen normalizing by the maximum.
Thus, EPOTconverges to δfor large ϕ(blue line approaching red line). When ϕ=max ijCij,
the partial OT error is maximal since EOTis combined with δ.
