ABSTRACT
To address the urgent challenge of climate change, there is a critical need to tran-
sition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy systems, with renewable
energy sources playing a pivotal role. However, the inherent variability of renew-
able energy, without effective storage solutions, often leads to imbalances between
energy supply and demand. Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) emerges as a
promising long-term storage solution to bridge this gap, yet its widespread imple-
mentation is impeded by the high computational costs associated with high fidelity
UHS simulations. This paper introduces UHS from a data-driven perspective and
outlines a roadmap for integrating machine learning into UHS, thereby facilitating
the large-scale deployment of UHS.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Renewable energy, a key player in combating climate change, is gaining increasing global adoption
Energy 2020 (2010); United nations (2015). In 2022, renewables contributed 13.1 %to the US’s
primary energy consumption U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) (2022) and 21.5 %to
its utility-scale electricity generation. Furthermore, by 2024, countries like Spain, Germany, and Ire-
land are expected to generate over 40 %of their annual electricity from wind and solar photovoltaics
U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) (2023). Despite these strides, renewable energy
sources face challenges due to unpredictable variations in atmospheric conditions and geographic
limitations, leading to fluctuations in energy supply.
Underground hydrogen (H 2) storage (UHS) is emerging as a vital technology for mitigating the
intermittency of renewable energy sources Zivar et al. (2021); Tarkowski & Uliasz-Misiak (2022).
When there’s a surplus in renewable energy production, excess electricity is converted into H 2and
stored in geological formations. During times of high demand or low renewable energy generation,
the stored H 2is then retrieved and utilized to meet energy needs. UHS, unlike batteries typically
used for short-term storage Raad et al. (2022), is capable of storing significant amounts of energy
over longer periods. This capability is crucial for counteracting seasonal energy fluctuations and
maintaining a consistent energy supply year-round.
UHS shares similarities with other subsurface applications such as hydrocarbon development
Christie & Blunt (2001) and geological carbon sequestration (GCS) Moridis et al. (2023); Wen
et al. (2023). However, it is distinguished by more complex operational conditions. In hydrocarbon
development, the process is typically focused on extraction, while GCS is solely about injection. In
contrast, UHS operates on a cyclic basis, incorporating both injection and extraction stages. This
complexity in operational conditions introduces greater uncertainty in H 2storage performance. Tra-
ditionally, the prediction of UHS performance relies on high-fidelity physics-based reservoir simu-
lations Lysyy et al. (2021); Feldmann et al. (2016); Hogeweg et al. (2022); Okoroafor et al. (2023).
These simulations accurately predict the H 2movement and pressure changes in geological forma-
tions during UHS operations. However, they are extremely computationally intensive, thus delaying
the pace of large-scale UHS deployment. To accelerate UHS prediction, turning to surrogate mod-
eling via machine learning (ML) offers a promising strategy.

Figure 1: Temporal evolution of the spatial distribution of H 2saturation and reservoir pressure in a
2D UHS simulation. H 2is injected and withdrawn from a central well in a depleted gas reservoir
over ten annual cycles comprising a 6-month injection stage followed by a 6-month withdrawal
stage. The initial two subfigures (top row) depict the heterogeneous porosity and permeability of
the geological formation. Subsequent figures show the H 2saturation and pressure distributions at
various time points during UHS operations. ‘Early’ of a stage refers to two months after its onset, and
‘end’ of a stage to six months. Porosity is dimensionless; permeability is in millidarcys ( 10−15m2);
H2saturation is dimensionless; pressure is in bars ( 105Pa).
Currently, there is a knowledge gap in the literature when it comes to developing ML surrogate
models for UHS–with only two articles on the subject up to our knowledge Mao et al. (2024); Chen
et al. (2024). This gap is attributed not only to the fact that UHS is an emerging field but also to
the inherent complexity of UHS operational conditions. It is important to note that the knowledge
and techniques used in surrogate modeling for GCS do not directly apply to UHS due to its distinct
and intricate operational dynamics. In this study, we outline the unique challenges of applying ML
to UHS and propose ideas for developing accurate and efficient UHS ML models, supporting risk
assessment and storage optimization of future UHS operations.
2 D ATA GENERATION
UHS simulations are conducted by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) the details of which
can be found in Appendix A. While data for these simulations can be generated using reservoir sim-
ulators with specific input configurations, there is a hope that future work will make such datasets
publicly available. The computational cost of these simulations increases significantly with refined
grids or an increased number of components in the system. For our preliminary studies, we uti-
lized tNavigatorDynamics (2023) to perform 1000 2D UHS simulations in depleted gas reservoirs,
varying porosity and permeability heterogeneity. Each simulation includes ten annual cycles of six-
month H 2injection followed by six months of withdrawal. These simulations were parallelized
across four 64-core CPU servers, taking approximately five days to complete. An example is de-
picted in Figure 1. See Appendix B.1 for more details on the data produced, and Figure 4 for a
simulation conducted in a different type of geological formation. It should be noted that data gen-
eration of more realistic systems, such as ones that are not 2D, that will require significantly more
computing power.

3 R OADMAP TOWARDS ML FOR UHS
We outline the required capabilities for a UHS ML model, reference GCS research with potential
applicability to UHS, and identify their limitations due to the complexity of UHS operations.
3.1 M ODEL PARAMETERS
A UHS ML model receives many uncertain input parameters, and predicts many output parame-
ters. The uncertain input parameters for UHS models include geological and operational parame-
ters. Geological parameters typically involve reservoir depth, thickness, permeability, porosity, and
geothermal gradient. Operational parameters commonly cover the injection-withdrawal scheme,
injection pressure, production pressure, the number of storage cycles, and cushion gas type and vol-
ume (the cushion gas is injected before H 2cycling to provide pressure support for H 2recovery).
Theoutput parameters crucial for UHS projects fall into two categories. The first involves spatial
distributions of key variables, including H 2saturation, reservoir pressure, and surface deformation.
The second includes scalar metrics for evaluating storage performance, such as H 2recovery factor,
purity of produced H 2, gas-water ratio, and well injectivity.
3.2 T RANSLATING GCS METHODS TO UHS
There is abundant research that applies ML to GCS. The methods developed can be divided into
deep learning architectures, such as graph neural networks Ju et al. (2023), and neural operators,
such as nested Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) Wen et al. (2023). Since GCS and UHS simulations
involve the same set of PDEs (with different boundary conditions at the well), a good first stride
towards ML for UHS is translating these frameworks to the UHS setting. Nonetheless, we foresee
three challenges when translating GCS models to UHS.
3.3 C HALLENGES TO OVERCOME
The first challenge involves developing successful auto-regressive models . An auto-regressive
model uses its previous outputs as inputs to generate future predictions. This contrasts with the
static models commonly found in GCS literature Wen et al. (2022); Diab & Al-Kobaisi (2023),
which directly predict a specific point in time by taking the desired time as an input parameter.
Auto-regressive models offer advantages, including the ability to extrapolate over time with reason-
able accuracy, something static models cannot do. By leveraging time extrapolation and decreasing
the simulated time, models can be trained over a wider range of uncertain input parameters Time
extrapolation can allow for training over a wider range of uncertain input parameters by decreasing
simulation time. Additionally, they can leverage monitoring data from ongoing UHS projects to
enhance future predictions without model retraining or tuning, helping with subsequent operational
optimization. However, there is a common concern for the performance of auto-regressive models
due to their potential to accumulate errors over time, a problem that could be compounded by the
complex operational dynamics of UHS. Nonetheless, we provide preliminary results in Appendix B
that, despite error accumulation, auto-regressive models perform comparatively well to static ones
in the UHS setting.
The second challenge is modifying GCS architectures to predict scalar values . Unlike GCS,
predicting the temporal evolution of the spatial distribution of H 2saturation, reservoir pressure, and
surface deformation is insufficient for UHS projects. To evaluate the risks and optimize the storage
operations, models also need to predict scalar values that are critical UHS performance metrics, such
as those mentioned in Section 3.1. We are assessing the possibility of tweaking the decoders of GCS
models to predict both spatial distributions and scalar values.
The third challenge lies in creating models that produce real-time high-resolution UHS predic-
tions . Although GCS methods exist, such as nested FNOs, UHS may demand high resolution in
larger spaces than GCS. Cushion gasses increase the size of the gas plume, cyclic injection schemes
complicate the plume’s behavior, and deployment in geological formations with preferential paths
increase plume migration. Dealing with these factors may demand high-resolution in larger areas
than in GCS operations. We elaborate on this in Appendix C.

B C OMPARING STATIC AND AUTO -REGRESSIVE MODELS USING U-NET
In this appendix, we compare the performance of static and auto-regressive models using U-net, a
popular image-to-image model. Our objective is to show brief experimental data that auto-regressive
models do not accumulate a significant amount of error and that auto-regressive models can extrapo-
late in time successfully. We trained four U-net models to predict H 2saturation or pressure following
the static or the auto-regressive frameworks.
B.1 D ATASET
The dataset consists of the simplest setup for UHS. There are 1000 simulations, each with a unique
porosity and permeability map with fixed operational parameters. The task is to predict the progres-
sion of the H 2plume and pressure. Every simulation goes up to 10 years with a time output every
2 months. Every 6 months, the simulation changes between injection and withdrawal. Each simula-
tion is 2D in a 7680m x 7680m grid with the well always located in the middle. To approximate a
2D behavior, the simulator gives the reservoir a thickness of 100m. Even though the simulation was
produced with 256 resolution, the dataset’s resolution was downgraded to 64 resolution to speed up
training in these preliminary results.
The dataset is split into 4 parts as follows:
• Training dataset: this dataset consists of 700 simulations with simulation time going up to
7 years.
• Validation set 1 (time extrapolation): this dataset consists of the 700 simulations used in
the training set and using the leftover 3 years of simulation time.
• Validation set 2 (geological extrapolation): this dataset consists of 150 simulations not used
in the training set with simulation time going up to 7 years.
• Validation set 3 (geological and time extrapolation): this dataset consists of the 150 simu-
lations used in validation set 2 and using the leftover 3 years of simulation time.
The leftover 150 simulations of the 1000 total simulations are reserved as a testset, but we will
not do experimentation on them in this paper. For performance comparisons between static and
auto-regressive models, we only use Validation set 2 .
The input parameters are indicated in Table 1 and as follows. Distance to well: Since the well is
always located in the middle, the distance to well channel is transformed so that values near the well
are highest, and then normalized to values between 0 and 1. Our experiments show that this channel
is very important for good predictions. Cycle stage: The channel is a broadcast of 1 if the time step
being predicted is of injection, and -1 otherwise. Our experiments show that this channel is very
important for good predictions.

Pressure, auto-regressive 0.0224 0.0544
Pressure, static 0.00873 0.0158
B.2 U- NET ARCHITECTURES
All four models share the same architecture. Each model has three down/upsampling layers, with
initial embedding size of 64 and ReLU activation functions. The models for H 2saturation have a
final sigmoid activation layer while pressure models have a final tanhshrink activation layer. The
error function is mean absolute error (MAE) for all of them.
B.3 T RAINING AND RESULTS
Each model is trained with a batch size of 64. The initial learning rate is 0.0001, halved every 25
epochs. Training is set for 200 epochs, but training is halted if 10 consecutive epochs pass with no
improvements in training error. The model gets saved whenever a new average validation error is
achieved, which is calculated every 10 epochs. This helps guarantee that the output model does not
overfit. In static models, only Validation set 2 is used to decide whether to save the model as the
other validation sets test extrapolation in time. We noticed in our experiments that static models are
prone to overfitting, so we added L2 regularization. The models were trained on an A100 GPU with
40GB of memory.
See Table 2 for the results. Of note is that auto-regressive models perform significantly better when
they are fed perfect information, which is the case during training. Auto-regressive models outper-
form static models in validation error by 86.1%and71.0%in H 2saturation and pressure respec-
tively. Nonetheless, as we will see, this gap in performance changes in long roll-outs.
B.4 A CCUMULATION OF ERROR IN AUTO -REGRESSIVE MODELS
To contrast error accumulation in auto-regressive models against static model errors, we will show
three different types of plots. The first two types of plots are the progression of the models against
time. The last type shows the difference in MAE of auto-regressive models and static models against
time. We recognize that this comparison cannot definitively settle whether auto-regressive models
can perform as well as static models despite error accumulation. Nonetheless, we believe that our
results are promising and point to the need for further studies to create architectures or training
schemes tailored to the auto-regressive setting. For this proposal, we will do this only for 5 randomly
chosen simulations from the validation set. Nonetheless, we hope to do more thorough studies in
the future. See Figure 2 for the results.

one time step is equivalent to 2 months. Figures 2a, 2c, 2e concern H 2saturation models, while
Figures 2b, 2d, 2f concern pressure models. Figures 2e, 2f plot time steps against the MAE of the
auto-regressive model minus the MAE of the static model.

 (b) Pressure auto-regressive
Figure 3: Demonstration of extrapolation in time of auto-regressive models. Figure 3a demonstrates
this for the H 2model, while Figure 3b demonstrates it for the pressure model.
Auto-regressive versus static: In Figures 2e, 2f we compare the numerical difference between
auto-regressive models and static models directly by plotting time steps against the MAE of auto-
regressive models minus the MAE of static models. If the values are negative, then the auto-
regressive model had better performance than the static model. Thus, it is surprising to see an
uneven result. Figure 2e shows that H 2auto-regressive models outperformed static models, while
2f shows the opposite for pressure. Surprisingly, the difference for H2models widens as time steps
increases despite the accumulation of error in auto-regressive models.
H2models: Figure 2c hints that as time steps increases, the predictions get harder and harder to do
for H 2static models. This might be because as the plume increases, the task to predict the intricacies
of the plume get harder. Moreover, as time progresses, the hydrogen plume settles into progressively
more static positions, thus making it harder for a static model to capture the fine differences between
different time steps. This difficulty does not seem to arise in the auto-regressive model which have
a weak upward trend when compared to the upward trend of the auto-regressive model.
Pressure models: Figure 2d shows no upward trend on the pressure static model, but surpris-
ingly, Figure 2b shows only a weak upward trend in the pressure auto-regressive model. This hints
at the fact that accumulation of error is not significant enough to make the pressure static model
significantly outperform the pressure auto-regressive model.
Conclusions: This brief empirical result motivates the need for further study on the true difference
in performance between auto-regressive models and static models in the setting of UHS. Static
models seem to struggle when predicting large time steps. While auto-regressive models have much
better training errors, it seems that this difference in performance disappears in long-term predictions
probably due to the accumulation of error. Thus, there seems to be two possible directions for further
study: either to make static models that do well in large time steps, or to make auto-regressive
architectures or training schemes that accumulate less error. The latter has the additional operational
benefits we mentioned in Section 3.
B.5 E XTRAPOLATION OVER TIME IN AUTO -REGRESSIVE MODELS
In this section, we provide brief empirical evidence that auto-regressive models can extrapolate in
time successfully. Figure 3 shows the error of auto-regressive models up to time step 60. Since the
last time step in the training set is 42, this shows that the models are able to do reasonably well when
extrapolating in time. It is worth noting that Figure 3a seems to have a persistent upward trend,
while this trend seems to be absent in Figure 3b. This behavior hints at the fact that H 2models have
significantly different behaviors than pressure models. Their difference in unit magnitude, where H 2
values range from 0 to 1 and pressure values range from negative to positive values, might provide
an explanation.

Figure 4: A 2D UHS simulation that captures the H 2plume and pressure as time progresses. H 2
is injected and withdrawn in cycles of 6 months each, where the simulator further subdivides each
6 month stage into 3 parts. By start of a stage, we mean 2 months after it has started as this is the
earliest when the simulator saves data. By end of a stage, we mean 6 months after it has started. The
simulation is carried out in a different type of mapping than in Figure 1. This figure illustrates the
preferential paths that the hydrogen plume takes, making the plume go far from the well. Coarsening
the image in the outer parts of the plume would delete the preferential paths of the plume. This can
potentially obstruct the model learning the true behavior of the plume in these kinds of geological
formations.
C H IGH-RESOLUTION MODELING FOR H2PLUME DYNAMICS
Geological formations are commonly characterized by two types of heterogeneity: fluvial and Gaus-
sian fields. In Gaussian fields, properties such as porosity and permeability are distributed based on
a normal (Gaussian) distribution. This distribution leads to gradual and predictable variations in
these properties throughout the formation. Conversely, fluvial fields derive their heterogeneity from
the sediment deposition processes of rivers and streams. This results in intricate patterns of sand
bodies, silt, and clay, exhibiting a wide range of properties that reflect the dynamic interplay of
water flow and sediment transport. Due to the complex nature of these deposits, fluvial fields often
feature preferential flow paths with high porosity and permeability. An illustration of fluvial field
heterogeneity is shown Figure 4.
Compared to CO 2, H2exhibits lower viscosity and higher diffusivity in subsurface environments. In
fluvial fields characterized by highly permeable channels, the footprint of an H 2plume can expand
significantly, resulting in the gas plume front extending far from the injection well. The preliminary
injection of cushion gas prior to H 2cycling can further enlarge the gas plume. To precisely model
the plume’s shape, a high-resolution computational grid is necessary across a broad section of the
simulation domain. The approach of applying drastic local grid refinement near the well, as com-
monly done in previous geological carbon storage (GCS) projects, may not be adequate for UHS
modeling, due to the distinct behavior of H 2in the subsurface.
