ABSTRACT
Carbon credit programs finance projects to reduce emissions, remove pollutants,
improve livelihoods, and protect natural ecosystems. Ensuring the quality and in-
tegrity of such projects is essential to their success. One of the most important
variables used in nature-based solutions to measure carbon sequestration is the
diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees. In this paper, we propose an automatic
mobile computer vision method to estimate the DBH of a tree using a single depth
map on a smartphone, along with our created dataset DepthMapDBH2023 . We
successfully demonstrated that this dataset paired with a lightweight regression
convolutional neural network is able to accurately estimate the DBH of trees dis-
tinct in appearance, shape, number of tree forks, tree density and crowding, and
vine presence. Automation of these measurements will help crews in the field who
are collecting data for forest inventories. Gathering as much on-the-ground data
as possible is required to ensure the transparency of carbon credit projects. Access
to high-quality datasets of manual measurements helps improve biomass models
which are widely used in the field of ecological simulation. The code used in this
paper is publicly available on Github and the dataset on Kaggle.
1 I NTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
Creating forest inventories is a key component of carbon accounting as it is used to estimate forestry
indices like forest growing stock, basal area, biomass, and carbon stock. The tree diameter at breast
height is one of the variables used in allometric models [1, 2, 3, 4] to estimate tree carbon seques-
tration.
In a typical ground forest inventory survey, a field worker must wrap a measuring tape [5] around
a tree trunk to measure the diameter of a tree at ”breast height” (1.3 meters). A measuring tape
can be difficult to use in the field depending on diverse ecological and environmental factors [6].
Furthermore, measuring the DBH of trees with tape may require two people for larger trees, and is
time intensive, making the work cost prohibitive. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach
to estimate the DBH of a tree using a single depth map. This process can be easily integrated
into a mobile application that saves field crews hours when creating forest inventories. It will also
allow them to cover more surface and collect more data to optimize the carbon simulation/prediction
models.
2 R ELATED WORK
Researchers have been working on estimating DBH using LiDAR remote sensing data [7] or using
mobile LiDAR scanning systems [8]. Some research has been done on the use of smartphone camera
images to calculate dense point clouds for the estimation of a tree’s DBH [9, 10]. Similar research to
our own, estimation of tree DBH with the use of depth information from consumer mobile devices,
has been conducted. However, this research requires multiple steps as it involves the extraction of
depth maps from RGB images of the trees using a depth extraction model before calculating the
DBH [11].

The novel solution we propose here, which includes the combination of a light deep learning ap-
proach and a single depth map, can be used for ground data collection and is meant to be used
directly and easily on a smartphone. This single-pass neural network model provides a more acces-
sible solution for forest inventory crews when integrated into a smartphone application.
Convolutional neural networks [12] have been used for regression tasks to estimate dimensions [13]
successfully which encouraged our efforts to pursue this work.
3 D ATASET
In this section, we will present the dataset DepthMapDBH2023 that we have created for this project.
We will explain the data collection process, data features, and challenges encountered while collect-
ing the dataset. The dataset is currently available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/
datasets/earthshot/depthmapdbh2023 .
3.1 D ATA COLLECTION
We have gathered 1008 trees’ RGB pictures along with their corresponding 192x192x1 depth maps
and tape-measured DBH values.
Figure 1: Dataset structure
We designed a separate test set (164 samples) with different physical trees of diameters ranging from
0 cm to 109 cm.

We focused our data gathering on collecting DBH values between 0 and 120 cm in a relatively even
distribution. Our final DBH value distribution for the datasets is illustrated in Figure 2.

3.2 C HALLENGES
In order to generate the depth maps required for our research, we created a special iOS application
for LiDAR iPhones. The application captured the necessary information needed for building this
dataset. The values in the depth maps collected are in meters (float) but a conversion to decimeters
was advantageous to distribute the values more evenly in the 0-255 float space.
Our goal to create a robust model that was effective in a wide range of settings required carefully
collecting a diverse variety of images that modeled the real-world scenarios in which the application
could potentially be used. To achieve this purpose, we collected data from a diverse array of trees
distinct in appearance, shape, number of tree forks, tree density and crowding, and vine presence.
In order to collect more data, we generated depth maps from different angles and distances for each
tree. Capturing depth maps at different distances to the trees is important so that the dataset can
cover a wide range of user-to-tree distances.
We also included several images with no tree to address false positive results.

4 E XPERIMENTS
Our model architecture is a single-channel input regression convolutional neural network (CNN).
We experimented with four efficient modified convolutional neural network models (under 35MB
each), all pre-trained on ImageNet [14], to solve this regression task as our final goal is to run
this model on a mobile application: MobileNet [15], MobileNetV2 [16], DenseNet121 [17], and
EfficientNetB0 [18]. We experimented with adding RGB data to the inputs, but the results during the
preliminary tests for single-channel depth maps proved to be superior to 4 channels (RGB + Depth
map). Moreover, as our future goals include implementing this model into a mobile application,
where memory and computation efficiency are of high concern, we decided to continue and run all
our experiments with only one channel (depth map).
We ran experiments on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU with batch sizes of 8, 16 and 32, a
plateau-reduced learning rate starting at 0.001, the Adam optimizer and MSE loss.
The dataset was randomly divided into training data and validation data in a ratio of 80:20% after it
was randomly shuffled. The metrics on the validation data were used to control the reduced learning
rate and early stopping. For each modified regression CNN architecture, we ran several training
sessions with different random shuffling seeds.

5 R ESULTS
Table 1 presents the results of the generalization performance of the models using the test data
collected from different trees. We used the mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE),

the root squared error (RMSE) and the R-squared value as metrics. All DBH estimations inferior to
zero were set to 0 as it is impossible to get a negative DBH.
Model MAE MSE RMSE R2 batch size seed Model size (MB)
Modified DenseNet121 3.21 24.40 4.94 0.97 32 8809 33
Modified MobileNetV2 3.63 38.21 6.18 0.96 8 7150 14
Modified MobileNet 3.94 42.46 6.52 0.96 8 8439 16
Modified EfficientNetB0 8.17 121.63 11.03 0.88 32 3191 29
Table 1: Best performance on the test set for each modified regression CNN
All the modified models performed well on this task except the EfficientNetB0 which consistently
had the lowest performance. The best model is the Modified DenseNet121 with an R2 of 0.97.

modified DenseNet121 model
However, if we consider the sizes of the models, the performance of the MobileNetV2 model with a
size of only 14MB was also quite competitive.
6 C ONCLUSION
We introduce in this paper a new dataset called DepthMapDBH2023 consisting of 1008 training
samples and 164 test samples. We have successfully demonstrated that this single channel depth
map dataset contains the necessary information to estimate DBH when paired with a sufficiently so-
phisticated computer vision model such as a regression convolutional neural network. After training
the modified CNNs on the dataset and comparing the resulting metrics on the test set, the modi-
fied DenseNet121 was selected as the optimal DBH estimation model. The modified MobileNetV2
model is a notable runner-up if the size of the model is to be taken into consideration. We have
shown in this paper that using a single 192x192 depth map of a tree along with a small regression
CNN gives an adequate and useful estimation of the DBH of a tree. This method also only requires
a fraction of the time when compared to traditional tree-measuring methods. The goal of this project
is to help crews in the field who are creating forest inventories to measure trees in a faster and more
cost-efficient way.
