Abstract
Climate change has driven increases in wildfire prevalence, prompting development
of wildfire spread models. Advancements in the use of satellites to detect fire loca-
tions provides opportunity to enhance fire spread forecasts from numerical models
via data assimilation. In this work, a method is developed to infer the history of a
wildfire from satellite measurements using a conditional Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (cWGAN), providing the information necessary to initialize
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models in a physics-informed approach based on
measurements. The cWGAN, trained with solutions from WRF-SFIRE, produces
samples of fire arrival times (fire history) from the conditional distribution of ar-
rival times given satellite measurements, and allows for assessment of prediction
uncertainty. The method is tested on four California wildfires and predictions are
compared against measured fire perimeters and reported ignition times. An average
Sorensen’s coefficient of 0.81 for the fire perimeters and an average ignition time
error of 32 minutes suggests that the method is highly accurate.
1 Introduction
Climate change has induced increases in wildfire frequency and severity, with conditions conducive
to large fires expected to become more common as climate predictions indicate drier summers and
more heat in years to come [ 1–4]. Wildfires impact air quality, cause destruction of property and harm
to health, and negatively influence atmospheric composition through the release of greenhouse gases,
making wildfire behavior models critical [ 5–8]. Wildfires are strongly coupled to meteorological
conditions, motivating the development of coupled wildfire-atmosphere models which aim to capture
these interactions. However, issues of accumulated model errors leading to degraded forecasts exist,
leading to interest in performing data assimilation [ 9–11]. Satellite-based active fire (AF) products
are a commonly used measurement type for data assimilation which can provide AF detections with
a resolution of up to 375 m at a temporal frequency of around 12 hours, however these measurements
can have artifacts and are at spatio-temporal resolutions lower than current wildfire models [12].
For dynamic coupled atmosphere-wildfire spread models, the state of the system is represented by all
the wildfire and atmosphere variables in the simulation. To perform data assimilation in this setting it
has been demonstrated that if the precise history of a wildfire during its initial spread was known, then
this history could be prescribed within a coupled wildfire-weather model to spin-up the atmosphere
with the right amount of heat and mass flux added at the right place and time, yielding an atmospheric
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023state which is in sync with the fire state at the end of the initial phase, providing an initial condition to
start a simulation from [ 13]. Thus, the data assimilation problem can be transformed to one of using
satellite measurements to determine the history of a fire in the initial period, as succinctly represented
by the fire arrival time which is defined as the time the fire arrives at a given location [13, 14].
Farguell et al. [15] used a support vector machine (SVM) to estimate fire arrival times based on
satellite active fire data, however this method did not incorporate any physics inherent to wildfire
spread into estimates and does not provide information about uncertainty. The method described here
addresses these limitations, starting with a probabilistic interpretation of the problem where both
the measured active fire pixels and the desired fire arrival time field are treated as random vectors.
The inference problem is then one of quantifying the conditional probability distribution for the fire
arrival time conditioned on a given measurement of active fire pixels. The measured fire pixels and
the arrival time field are both high-dimensional random vectors, making this problem challenging to
solve. To address this challenge, we utilize a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network
(cWGAN) to learn and then sample from a conditional probability distribution. The approach uses
wildfire simulation results from WRF-SFIRE for training, allowing the appropriate physics to be
injected into predictions. The trained algorithm is applied retrospectively to four California wildfires
and its performance is assessed; additional comparisons are made to the SVM-based method.
2 Problem formulation
Letτdenote the matrix of fire arrival times whose components τijrepresent the fire arrival times
for the i-th pixel along the longitude and the j-th pixel along the latitude. Assume there are Nτ
such pixels and therefore τ∈Ωτ⊂RNτ. Each pixel is of size 60×60meters. A measurement
operator Mmay be applied which transforms τinto a coarse, sparse, and noisy measurement ¯τusing
the mapping M: Ωτ→Ω¯τ. We note that Mmay easily be approximated, however here we are
interested in the inverse problem, which maps from ¯τtoτand is much more challenging to solve.
We recognize that a single measurement can correspond to a distribution of likely fire arrival times,
and to cope with the ill-posed nature of this problem we adopt a probabilistic approach. We let the
inferred field τand the measurements ¯τbe modeled by random variables Tand¯T, respectively. We
recognize that given a measurement ¯τ, we are interested in learning and generating samples from
the conditional distribution PT|¯T. We accomplish this by first generating Npairwise samples of
arrival times and measurements (τ(i),¯τ(i)), i= 1,···, Nfrom the joint distribution PT¯Tusing
WRF-SFIRE (and data augmentation) to generate Ninstances of arrival times τ(i), to which the
measurement operator is applied to obtain the corresponding ¯τ(i). We then use this data to train
a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (cWGAN). Following this, active fire
satellite measurements of a wildfire may be used as input to the cWGAN to produce samples of the
arrival time from the conditional distribution. These samples are then used to generate statistics of
interest, including the pixel-wise mean and standard deviation in arrival time.
3 Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (cWGAN)
The cWGAN consists of two subnetworks, a generator gand a critic d. The generator gis given
by the mapping g: Ωz×Ω¯τ→Ωτ, where z∈Ωz⊂RNzis a latent variable modeled using the
random variable Z, with distribution PZselected such that it is easy to sample from. The critic dis
given by the mapping d: Ωτ×Ω¯τ→R.
For a given measurement ¯τ, the generator gproduces samples τg=g(z,¯τ),z∼PZfrom the
learned conditional distribution Pg
T|¯T(τ|¯τ). The training of the cWAN requires this distribution to
be close to the true conditional distribution PT|¯T(τ|¯τ)in the Wasserstein-1 metric. The cWGAN
is trained using the objective function, L(d,g) =E(τ,¯τ)∼PT¯T[d(τ,¯τ)]−Eτg∼Pg
T|¯T
¯τ∼P¯T[d(τg,¯τ)], and
the optimal generator and critic ( g∗andd∗, respectively) are determined by solving the min-max
problem (d∗,g∗) = arg mingarg maxdL(d,g). Assuming the critic dis 1-Lipschitz in both its
arguments, it is shown in [ 16] that the g∗can be used to approximate the true conditional distribution.
This implies that once the generator has been trained it may be used to approximate the statistics from
2the true conditional distribution as Eτ∼PT|¯T[ℓ(τ)]≈1
KKP
i=1ℓ(g∗(z(i),¯τ)),z(i)∼PZ.Following
from this, the pixel-wise mean prediction for τbased on a given ¯τcan be computed by setting
ℓ(τ) =τand the pixel-wise variance may be computed by setting ℓ(τ) = (τ−E[τ])2. The
interested reader is referred to [ 17,18,16] for additional information. Further details of the cWGAN
architecture are included in Appendix A.
3.1 Training the cWGAN
To train the cWGAN, samples of τare drawn from the prior marginal distribution PTby performing
simulations with the coupled atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE. Fire arrival times are computed
from 20 WRF-SFIRE simulations, each considering 2 day fire spread over flat terrain with uniform
fuel and point ignitions. The simulations varied only in the initial wind speed, which was prescribed
uniformly in one direction. Resulting τsamples were on a grid of size 512×512, with a 60 m
resolution. Data augmentation was performed by rotating and translating the 20 solutions τ. To each
sample τan approximation of the measurement operator Mwas applied to generate a corresponding
measurement ¯τ=M(τ), yielding the pairs (τ(i),¯τ(i))from the joint distribution PT¯Tto be used for
training. Lastly, a random amount of time was added to the fire arrival times to simulate an unknown
ignition time. Additional details about the measurement operator are provided in Appendix B, along
with sample data pairs in Appendix C. Training was tracked using a mismatch term defined as the
2-norm of the difference between the generated fire arrival time and the true fire arrival time. The
cWGAN was trained in PyTorch for 200 epochs, using a batch size of 5 and the Adam optimizer.
4 Results
The cWGAN-based method is tested on four California wildfires, namely the Bobcat, Tennant, Oak,
and Mineral fires. The method is applied to active fire measurements from the Visible Infrared
Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the polar-orbiting satellite Suomi-NPP, which provides
detections with a resolutions of 375 m. Measurements were separated by confidence level, such that
there is one measurement ¯τcontaining high confidence detections only and another measurement ¯τ
which contains both high and nominal confidence detections, resulting in two measurements ¯τper
fire on which predictions may be conditioned. Specifics on the preprocessing of the 375 m Level-2
VIIRS AF data is provided in Appendix D, along with the measurements ¯τused here.
The two measurements for each fire are used as input to the trained cWGAN, generating 200
realizations of the arrival time per measurement by sampling the latent vector zfrom its distribution.
It is important to note that predicted fire arrival times are relative to the start of the day. The
realizations are combined with different weights (0.2 for the high confidence and 0.8 for the high +
nominal confidence) to compute the pixel-wise mean and standard deviation of arrival times shown
in Fig. 1. The mean arrival time may then be used to generate a smooth sequence of fire perimeters to
initialize the state variables in a coupled weather/wildfire model, like WRF-SFIRE. It is additionally
noted that the standard deviation plots in Fig. 1 provide a measure of uncertainty in the predictions.
For comparison, Fig. 2 shows results from the SVM-based method described in Farguell et al. [15]
for the same set of VIIRS AF data used with the cWGAN approach here. It is observed that the SVM
method produces islands of unburnt regions within the predicted fire extents which are not present in
the cWGAN predictions and further provides no measure of uncertainty for the predictions.
To quantitatively assess fire arrival time predictions, high resolution infrared (IR) wildfire extent
perimeters provided by the National Infrared Operations (NIROPS) program are used as ground-truth,
against which geolocated fire perimeters, produced by plotting a contour of the fire arrival time for a
prescribed time, may be compared [ 19]. The IR perimeters used here are provided for the interested
reader in Appendix D. Predicted perimeters are compared with measured perimeters by identifying
the true positive pixels (burnt in both the prediction and truth), the false negative pixels (not burnt in
the prediction but burnt in truth) and the false positive pixels (burnt in the prediction but not burnt in
truth), marked as A, B and C, respectively, and using them to compute three metrics that quantify
the prediction quality. These metrics are the Sørensen–Dice coefficient (SC), the Probability of
Detection (POD), and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), computed as: SC=2A
2A+B+C, POD =
A
A+B, FAR =C
A+C. These metrics attain values between 0 and 1, where for the SC and POD
the best model yields a value of 1 and for the FAR a value of 0 is ideal. Predicted ignition times,

computed as the earliest predicted fire arrival time, may also be compared to ignition times reported
by CAL FIRE, for fires where this information is available (Tennant, Oak, and Mineral). Table 1
contains the SC, POD, FAR, and ignition time error values computed for the Bobcat (SC, POD, and
FAR only), Tennant, Oak, and Mineral fires based on predictions by the cWGAN method.
Quantitative results for the cWGAN predictions are compared to those for the SVM-based method,
which are provided in Table 2. It is found that in all cases except the Tennant fire, the SC for the
cWGAN method is higher than the SVM method. From the POD values we conclude that the SVM
method performs better, indicating that the cWGAN is less likely than the SVM method to capture
the full extent of the fire. On the other hand, the FAR values for the cWGAN are better than those for
the SVM method in every case, indicating the cWGAN is less likely than the SVM method to suffer
from false positive errors. Of these metrics, the SC is the most critical to do well on when evaluating

ignition time error values obtained for the cWGAN predictions.

is significantly more accurate than the SVM method.
5 Conclusion
Here a novel method for inferring the early-stage fire arrival time of a wildfire based on active
fire satellite detections has been developed and tested on four California wildfires. A probabilistic
approach is taken, enabling the ability to sample from the conditional distribution of fire arrival times
given a measurement, which is accomplished using a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network trained using solutions from WRF-SFIRE. The approach uniquely allows for quantification
of prediction uncertainty and further allows physics to be inject into the predictions through the use
of WRF-SFIRE solutions for training. Ultimately, this work enhances data assimilation capabilities
for wildfire models, which are becoming increasingly important in our continually changing climate.

B Measurement operator
The measurement operator Mused to generate an instance of measurement ¯τgiven a fire arrival time
τwas constructed to replicate the high resolution (375 m) VIIRS L2 AF data in the following steps:
1.Coarsen τ(i)obtained from data augmentation to a resolution of 375 m using nearest
neighbor interpolation.
2.Select four measurement times ( ti, i= 1,···,4) from a uniform distribution between 2
hours and 48 hours and sort them in ascending order.
3.For each measurement time, ti, create a time interval (ti−δ(−), ti)where δ(−)is selected
fromU(6,12), where Udenotes the uniform probability distribution. If ti−δ(−)<0, set it
to 0.
4.Create four copies of the coarsened τ(i), one for each time interval, and denote them by
τ(i)
j, j= 1,···,4.
5.To each τ(i)
j, apply a distinct knowledge mask that randomly eliminates 50% of the fire
arrival time values. Set eliminated pixels to a background value.
6.For each τ(i)
j, set fire arrival time pixels falling within the associated time interval (ti−
δ(−), ti)toti. Set the remainder to a background value, to be assigned later.
7.Combine the four measurements into a single consolidated measurement by selecting
τ(i)= min j(τ(i)
j)for each pixel.

8.Eliminate three 3×3km patches with locations selected at random. Set the values in these
patches to the background value to emulate measurement obstruction.

10.Addδ∈ U(0,24)hours to the arrival time and measurement pair (τ(i),¯τ(i))to account for
the fact that the ignition time is typically unknown.
11.Normalize the arrival time and measurement pair (τ(i),¯τ(i))to be in the interval [0,1]by
dividing it by 72hours and setting the background value to 1.
C Training data samples
Sample data pairs from the training data set are shown in Fig. 5.
D VIIRS AF measurements and IR perimeters
To preprocess VIIRS 375 m L2 AF satellite data to be used as input to the cWGAN, a domain of
interest with size 30.72×30.72km which is approximately centered on a desired wildfire is selected.
The domain is discretized based on latitude and longitude coordinates and cells corresponding to
AF detection locations are assigned a value based on the measurement time. Values assigned to
activated cells are the number of hours since the start of the day on which ignition occurred. The
measurements are then normalized using a value of 72 hours, following which remaining cells are
assigned a background value of 1, putting the measurements in the range [0,1], following the format
of the training data. This is done for all measurements available within the first 48 hours of a fire,
being sure to assign the earliest available measurement time for cells that correspond to detections in
more than one satellite measurement.
Shown in Fig. 6 are two measurements ¯τper fire, corresponding to the two confidence intervals. For
each fire, one IR fire extent measurement made within the first 48 hours after ignition is overlaid on
the measurement images for comparison. The times of the perimeter measurements are indicated in
the plot labels of Fig. 6 in hours and minutes (HH:MM format) from the start of ignition day.
