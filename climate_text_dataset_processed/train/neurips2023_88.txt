Abstract
Glacier systems are highly sensitive to climate change and play a pivotal role
in global mean sea level rise. As such, it is important to monitor how glacier
velocities and ice dynamics evolve under a changing climate. The growing wealth
of satellite observations has facilitated the inference of glacier velocities from
remote sensing imagery through feature tracking algorithms. At present, these
rely on sparse cross-correlation estimates as well as computationally expensive
optical flow solutions. Here we present a novel use of deep-learning for estimating
annual glacier velocities, utilizing the recurrent optical-flow based architecture,
RAFT, on consecutive pairs of optical Sentinel-2 imagery. Our results highlight that
deep learning can generate dense per-pixel velocity estimates within an automated
framework that utilizes Sentinel-2 images over the French Alps.
1 Introduction
The evolution of glaciers is widely regarded as a significant indicator of climate change [ 1]. These
systems play a crucial role in global mean sea level rise, contributing as much as 25–30% over past
decades [ 2,3]. This, in addition to the increased frequency of natural hazards affecting mountainous
communities and evolving local hydrology, motivate the need for improved glacier monitoring [ 4–6].
Advancements made in spaceborne remote sensing capabilities have led to enhanced data availability
with higher spatial resolution and lower revisit times. Glacier surface displacements can be inferred
from successive optical or radar remote sensing images through feature tracking algorithms based
on cross-correlation and optical flow techniques. A range of toolboxes have been developed with
end-to-end workflows for feature tracking, utilizing these classical algorithms [ 7]. Efforts have been
made to produce databases mapping glacier surface velocities at regional and global scales from
archives of Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery [8, 9].
Recently, deep learning computer vision algorithms have been effective at learning velocity fields
from series of images, producing state-of-the-art optical flow estimation across synthetic datasets and
fluid flow estimation problems [ 10,11]. Deep learning for glacier monitoring has been applied to
the mapping of glacier extents, glacier debris classification and mapping glacial lakes from remote
sensing images [ 12–16]. However, it remains to be fully investigated the efficacy of deep learning
optical flow methods for inferring glacier velocity fields, despite the adoption of these methods across
various domains. Therefore, here we present a novel use of deep learning for mapping glacier-scale
velocity fields from remote sensing imagery. We adopt a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms

(RAFT) based architecture to estimate dense optical flow velocity fields from Sentinel-2 imagery
[17, 18].
2 Methodology
2.1 Workflow
In order to investigate the viability of deep learning based glacier image velocimetry, Sentinel-2
images need to be processed for input to the RAFT model, as well as target velocity fields generated
for supervised learning. The employed data processing pipeline used to generate the training and
test datasets is similar to the automated framework proposed by Millan et al. for generating glacier
velocities from multiple spaceborne imaging platforms [ 19]. All available Sentinel-2 images over
the region of interest are downloaded in Google Earth Engine. Since the images are optical, the
search query is filtered by cloud cover, with winter months dominated by snowfall and homogeneous
surface texture avoided. The near infrared band, Sentinel-2 band 8, is judged to produce sufficient
radiometric response and is therefore the single band utilized here for analysis.
The downloaded images are then Sobel-filtered in both the xandydirections to enhance contrast and
mitigate against shadows caused by the complex topography in mountainous regions. Glacier outlines
from the Randolf Glacier Inventory are used to generate image masks to remove non-glacierized
regions ahead of velocity estimation [ 20]. The processed images are then combined into image
pairs and segmented into overlapping tiles of size 256 ×256, which is the input size of the RAFT
model. Data augmentation is performed on the input images using rotations to modify dataset size
and improve robustness. Training labels are generated from a classical multi-level Horn-Schunk
solution implemented in Matlab which produces dense per-pixel velocity fields for the image pairs
[21]. The resulting velocity fields are filtered for outliers using a 9 ×9 median filter.
2.2 Study Site
The selected glacier of interest, shown in Figure 1, is the Mer de Glace of the Mont Blanc massif
in the French Alps, occupying an area of ∼30 km2. Ogives mark the glacier surface which appear
as alternating patterns of bright and dark strips. In-situ GPS measurements monitored as part of the
GLACIOCLIM service provide an independent measure of annual velocities for validation. The
training and test datasets are constructed from images acquired between the months of June and
October in 2021 and 2022 when snow cover is minimal, exposing the surface features. Image pairs
are selected by matching each image in 2021 with every available image acquired in 2022. This is
to ensure that sufficient displacement has occurred between images as literature reports an annual
velocity of ∼70 m/yr, requiring larger time intervals to resolve clear displacement between the 10
m resolution Sentinel-2 images [ 19,22]. From 2021 and 2022, 10 and 17 images respectively were
downloaded and processed according to the aforementioned workflow. This resulted in a training
dataset of 14,871 pairs of image tiles, 1,653 for validation and 1,836 for testing.

3 Results
The results shown in Figure 2 indicate that RAFT is able to infer velocities from tiled image pairs
within the glacier ablation zones of the test dataset. The displayed RMSE is taken as the L2 norm
of the glacierized regions. To further investigate the temporal consistency of the learned velocity
field inference, we download and process images from the preceding year, 2020, and similarly create
image pairs for the 2020–2021 period. A further 7 images with unoccluded visible texture are
downloaded and tiles containing independent GPS locations are created. The resulting velocity fields
inferred across all the image pairs are time-averaged to produce a single annual velocity mosaic
for comparison with the point GPS measurements. GPS measurements from this period come from
3 stakes in the Langue portion of the glacier measured in September 2020 and September 2021,
the distance moved by each stake representing the annual velocity. The starting stake coordinates
were converted to pixel locations for comparison with the inferred velocity fields. Figure 3 shows
the time-averaged velocity fields from the RAFT inference and the Horn-Schunk solutions for the
2020–2021 period. Although the RMSE value has increased from an average of 2–3 m/yr to 7.69
m/yr, the RAFT model still displays an ability to detect the dominant velocity in the western Langue
part of the glacier. From the GPS measurements, stakes 1, 3 and 4 measured 40.43, 31.46 and 31.28
m/yr respectively. The Horn-Schunk solution measured 35.93, 31.94 and 31.14 m/yr respectively
while RAFT was consistently lower with estimates of 29.97, 25.09 and 25.05 m/yr respectively across
the GPS stakes. Although the inferred velocities were lower, the variation in the RAFT solution was
consistent with the observed velocity measurements.
4 Conclusions and Future Work
Archives of satellite imagery have enabled the inference of glacier velocities from successive images
through feature tracking which is currently dominated by classical methods. Here we presented a
novel use of the deep recurrent optical flow architecture (RAFT) for this purpose, demonstrating its
effectiveness at learning per-pixel velocity estimates on Mer de Glace in the French Alps.

Future work will involve modification of the processing chain to allow the model to learn potential
feature maps from multiple bands rather than pre-processed single-channel inputs, which may improve
robustness to artefacts such as shadows. Since the training labels were generated by a multi-level
Horn-Schunk solution, the exploration of unsupervised learning strategies such as that of Meister et al.
to bypass expensive label generation will also be explored [ 23]. Physics-informed losses could also be
investigated to compensate for areas with low contrast. Generalization to glaciers in different climates
as well as marine terminating glaciers will also be explored. Additionally, generalization to satellite
images from other constellations such as Landsat-8 and Planet cubesats will also be investigated.
