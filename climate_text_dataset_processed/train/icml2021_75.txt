From Talk to Action with Accountability: Monitoring the Public Discussion of
Policy Makers with Deep Neural Networks and Topic Modelling

Abstract
Decades of research on climate have provided a
consensus that human activity has changed the cli-
mate and we are currently heading into a climate
crisis. While public discussion and research ef-
forts on climate change mitigation have increased,
potential solutions need to not only be discussed
but also effectively deployed. For preventing
mismanagement and holding policy makers ac-
countable, transparency and degree of informa-
tion about government processes have been shown
to be crucial. However, currently the quantity of
information about climate change discussions and
the range of sources make it increasingly difﬁ-
cult for the public and civil society to maintain
an overview to hold politicians accountable. In
response, we propose a multi-source topic aggre-
gation system (MuSTAS) which processes policy
makers speech and rhetoric from several publicly
available sources into an easily digestible topic
summary. MuSTAS uses novel multi-source hy-
brid latent Dirichlet allocation to model topics
from a variety of documents. This topic digest
will serve the general public and civil society in
assessing where, how, and when politicians talk
about climate and climate policies, enabling them
to hold politicians accountable for their actions to
mitigate climate change and lack thereof.
1. Introduction
The consensus that human activity caused the climate crisis
(Cook et al., 2016) has led to the development of many tools
and agreements, designed to support climate change miti-
gation efforts. Most notably the Paris Agreement, adopted

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at
ICML 2021.by 197 countries that aims to keep global warming below
2°C (UN, 2015). However, research efforts to mitigate the
climate crisis are lost without an efﬁcient international adap-
tation of proposed tools and policies.
Scientists, non-state actors, and voters increasingly critique
their government for insufﬁcient action mitigating climate
change (Dupont & Oberth ¨ur, 2012). This suggests a gap
between promises made by politicians and actual action
taken: ambitious promises for climate change mitigation
have turned into careless discourse with insufﬁcient mea-
sures taken.
Holding politicians accountable for their actions has been
shown to be a major factor in preventing mismanagement,
political corruption and misalignment of politician’s opin-
ions and the public they are representing (Adsera et al., 2003;
Lyrio et al., 2018). Transparency herein is so crucial, that it
has been considered a direct substitute for accountability in
the democratic process (Lyrio et al., 2018). Political trans-
parency, unfortunately, has been made increasingly difﬁcult,
not due to a lack, but because of the overwhelming quantity
of data accessible: The public and civil society organiza-
tions, lack the overview of all that politicians are discussing
across a multitude of platforms such as interviews, blog
posts, parliamentary speeches and social media posts. Our
work therefore, provides a tool for transparency, supporting
civil society in efforts to monitor political discourse around
climate change and hold policy makers accountable for their
promises and claims.
In Section 2 we introduce a Multi-Source Topic Aggrega-
tion System (MuSTAS) which increases transparency by
providing an overview of topics discussed by politicians
across a broad range of platforms. Additionally, MuSTAS
provides a user interface with topic summaries and tagged
source-texts.
In Section 3 we describe the ML foundation for MuSTAS: a
novel multi-source hybrid latent Dirichlet allocation model
which forms the core of this research proposal. In Section 4
we outline how MuSTAS impacts climate change.Monitoring Policy Makers with Deep Neural Networks and Topic Modelling
2. Multi-Source Topic Aggregation System
To help holding policy makers accountable, MuSTAS pro-
cesses documents (e.g. speech transcripts, tweets, blog
posts) from several publicly available sources into a com-
pact report, highlighting the distribution of topics the can-
didate or party has been discussing during the given time
period on the given platforms.
Figure 1. Overview of MuSTAS. 1) Crawling and pre-processing
data from Twitter API, Facebook API, blog posts, parliamentary
transcripts, etc. produced by the given politician. 2) Database
for storing the documents and modelling results. Each processed
entry includes topic, person, party, timestamp, data type, and
source URL, and document metadata. 3) Topic modelling over
all document types using a hybrid latent Dirichlet allocation as
described in Section 3. 4) Users can access the results through
a graphical user interface, which supports different analyses by
topic, time, person, platform, and example documents for the given
topic.
Through MuSTAS, the public and civil society will have
access to infographics that provide answers to questions re-
garding candidates or groups of candidates, topics discussed,
and mediums used, over different time periods (Figure 1 step
4). The questions answered with MusTAS could be e.g. ”Do
parliamentary discussions address climate change?”, ”How
much does the politician X talk about climate in contrast
to economy?”, ”Does the political discourse differ between
platforms meant to address the electorate (such as social me-
dia) and political spheres (parliamentary discussions)?”, and
”Does candidate X talk about different topics prior to the
elections in comparison to their time in the government?”.
With answers to these questions voters have better insight
what their candidate/party discuss in parliamentary sessions
after being elected. The civil society organisations can as-
sess how much each politician talks about climate in contrast
to other topics, which enables efﬁcient targeting of individ-
uals that need convincing on the urgency of climate friendly
policies.
Machine learning methods are crucial for this analysis, as
hundreds of politicians produce documents every day, and
expensive human-conducted surveys are not made regularly.
To enable the system to read and analyze the for-humans-
intractable amount of data and update the analysis by doing
online inference on daily basis, topic modelling has to be
outsourced to a ML model.3. Topic Modelling: Multi-Source Hybrid
LDA
Topic modelling is a widely used approach to describe the
content of text documents through a limited number of top-
ics (Yi & Allan, 2009), and used previously also on isolated
legislative speech (Glava ˇs et al., 2019). The topics are seen
as latent variables deﬁning a probability distribution for the
vocabulary of words in the document. The probability distri-
butions of topics are modelled with a probabilistic method
such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003),
which has been implemented in many different use cases
(Heidenreich et al., 2019; Rehurek & Sojka, 2010; Tong &
Zhang, 2016; Uys et al., 2008; Yi & Allan, 2009) to model
topics that are present in a document.
In order to build a holistic understanding which topics a
politician discusses, one needs to gather data from many
different media, see phase 1 of Figure 1. This poses a novel
challenge, since methods which successfully model topics
in tweets and other short documents, such as Biterm Topic
Model (Chen et al., 2015), Supervised LDA (Jonsson &
Stolee, 2015; Resnik et al., 2015), or LDA-U (Jonsson &
Stolee, 2015), differ from the models designed for longer
documents and large corpora (Rehurek & Sojka, 2010).
We propose a multi-source approach, where all documents
are processed to paragraphs pof similar length. For example,
a tweet could equal to one paragraph while a speech might
be split into several. Topic modelling is then performed
on these paragraphs individually, and a document’s topic
distribution is attained by aggregating the distributions of
its paragraphs.
Different types of documents might radically vary in vo-
cabulary and style. To mitigate this, we propose to use a
hybrid LDA (Moody, 2016) approach, where the easily inter-
pretable LDA has been made more robust by utilizing word
embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) provided by transformer
models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or RoBERTa
(Liu et al., 2019). The recently observed performance of
large transformer models (Brown et al., 2020) suggests that
the word-, document-, and topic embeddings applied in a
hybrid LDA (Moody, 2016) could be learned from a corpora
of various types of documents. In climate change mitigation,
hybrid LDA has been previously proposed for monitoring
climate change technology transfer (Kulkarni, 2020).
The topics are learned in unsupervised manner, and therefore
depend on the available data. The number of topics, deﬁned
by the researcher before training, will affect how granular
the found topics will be1. The suitable number of topics will
1For example, with 20 different topics all climate change re-
lated discussion could be part of e.g. two topics, while 200 topics
will result much more granular topics and discussion on e.g. land
usage or fossil fuels can be expected to belong to different topics.Monitoring Policy Makers with Deep Neural Networks and Topic Modelling

be experimented during the research and documented in the
ﬁndings.
The topic model will be trained ofﬂine before made available
in MuSTAS. This ensures that the topic modelling results are
comparable over time. Later models trained with updated
datasets can be released to MuSTAS alongside the original
model.
3.1. Empirical Evaluation - Modelling the Topics of
Finnish Politicians
We will demonstrate the functionality of multi-source hybrid
LDA as part of MuSTAS by implementing the system in
the Finnish context. In the case of Finland, a major portion
of public statements and discussions of politicians can be
covered by the data sources provided in Table 1. All the
sources are publicly available on the internet, so they can be
programmatically gathered to the MusTAS database (Figure
1, step 1).
The documents related to each decision maker, are retrieved
from each source and pre-processed to a common format
required by the hybrid LDA. Since the majority of docu-
ments produced by Finnish politicians are in Finnish, the
transformer used should be compatible with the language,
for example FinBERT (Virtanen et al., 2019).
4. Climate Impact
MuSTAS provides researchers, civil society, and the general
public with an easily interpretable digest of topics which
the policy makers have talked about.
To reach the goals of the Paris Agreement and mitigate
climate change, politicians need to implement a range of
ambitious policies. Increased accountability of government
ofﬁcials has been shown to be crucial in preventing political
mismanagement (Adsera et al., 2003). Because an account-
able actor needs to provide information and justiﬁcation
for their decisions (Mees & Driessen, 2019), the degree of
information (transparency) citizens have about their govern-
ment’s actions is one of two major hinges in accountability
(Adsera et al., 2003).
Currently, despite many democratic governments providinggreater access to government proceedings, transparency is
hindered by the sheer amount of data accessible. Media cov-
erings of political developments are biased toward speciﬁc
topics (Eady et al., 2019), actors (Snyder Jr & Str ¨omberg,
2010; Shor et al., 2015; V os, 2013), and private political
interests (Statham, 1996).
The proposed MuSTAS (Section 2) overcomes these barriers
by jointly analysing a wide range of publicly available data
and presenting data analyses in accessible and dynamic form
without representation- or political-bias. MuSTAS allows
the public to monitor political speech across platforms by
bringing a concise digest of politician’s statements, easily
accessible with links to the original documents. Therefore,
MuSTAS is a tool to track rhetorical political commitments
on climate change, equipping civil society and voters with
the means to hold decision makers accountable and incen-
tivize policy makers to follow through with legitimate poli-
cies.
The proposed work implements MuSTAS in the Finnish con-
text (Subsection 3.1). However, the ﬂexible system allows a
for a straight-forward implementation in other countries by
simply providing basic information on the national politi-
cians such as social media account IDs, blog URLs or links
to speeches and law initiatives.
This way MuSTAS can crawl and process the provided
source-documents for topic modelling regardless of the
country or other context of the politician. For the new
context, and possibly language, a new topic model needs
to be trained, but the data processing and visualisations of
the topic digests can be done using the same code base.
This paves way for implementing MuSTAS in other coun-
tries, providing data for accountability in all parliamentary
democracies.
