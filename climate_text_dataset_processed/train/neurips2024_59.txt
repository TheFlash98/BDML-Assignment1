Abstract
In 2023, wildfires burned record-breaking areas in Canada, resulting in significant
carbon loss, exacerbating climate change, and underscoring the need for relevant
datasets and machine learning methods for effective and efficient analysis [ 5].
To understand the fire development processes and assess the climate impact of
this natural disaster, burned area mapping datasets are essential for generating
high-quality burned scar maps, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the 2023
wildfires, particularly given the vast expanse of Canada. To this end, we propose
the CanadaFire2023 dataset, which includes burned area mapping data collected
from multiple satellite platforms, namely, Landsat-8, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-2,
specifically focused on these wildfires in the recorded history of Canada. To our
knowledge, this is the first dataset specifically focused on burned area detection
related to the unprecedented 2023 Canadian wildfires, using individual satellite
imagery. We also trained four deep learning models—FCN, U-Net, multiscale
ResNet, and SegFormer—for burned area mapping and evaluated the mapping
performance using binary segmentation metrics, demonstrating that these datasets
can serve as benchmarks for the research community studying wildfires and their
environmental consequences. The CanadaFire2023 dataset could facilitate down-
stream applications such as disaster management, carbon emission estimation, and
climate change mitigation.
1 Introduction
Canada possesses about 28% of the world’s boreal forest and roughly 25% of its peatlands, thereby
storing a significant amount of carbon across various biomes in North America. Over the past six
decades, burned areas from wildfires have doubled in Canada due to global warming and climate
change [ 9], and this trend poses a threat to the carbon sink of aboveground biomass and organic soils,
[13]. The 2023 Canadian wildfires, partially driven by early snow-melt and abnormal drought, [ 8]
are unparalleled in terms of burned areas and climate impacts. This event has attracted significant
attention from governments, society, and academia, emphasizing the need for wildfire monitoring,
disaster management, and climate change mitigation. However, few datasets are available for burned
area mapping, which is the foundation for climate analysis caused by wildfires. This motivates us
to answer two questions: How can we create burned area mapping datasets from different Earth
observation platforms? How can we establish machine learning benchmarks for the task of burned
area detection?
As a result of increasing temperatures and climate change in recent years, wildfires have become more
prevalent all over the world, leading to the development of multiple wildfire-related datasets to support
the understanding and analysis of this natural disaster [ 11,6,2]. For example, Ribeiro et al. created a
novel dataset collected by a UA V and trained a 3D U-Net model for segmenting wildfire-burned areas.
38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).Figure 1: Framework for creating the CanadaFire2023 datasets. The workflow involves: (i) generating
burned area annotations and (ii) recording semantic segmentation metrics (such as precision, recall,
and F1-score) for deep learning benchmarks across three satellite imagery datasets.
A large-scale Mediterranean wildfire modeling dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km, covering
the period from 2006 to 2022, has been released for two purposes: wildfire danger forecasting and
burned area estimation [ 6]. Gerard et al. present a multi-temporal U.S. dataset from 2018 to 2021
that focuses on active wildfire spreading, utilizing its unique time series structure [ 2]. Similar to
our dataset, an Indonesian burned area mapping dataset of Landsat-8 satellite images is introduced,
and a U-Net model is trained on it to detect burned areas [ 10]. Although these datasets all focus on
wildfires or burned area mapping, our CanadaFire2023 dataset differs in three ways. First, to the
best of our knowledge, CanadaFire2023 is the first dataset comprising individual imagery collected
by three satellite-mounted sensors, specifically focused on the 2023 Canadian wildfires, which had
substantial environmental and climate impacts. Second, CanadaFire2023 contains not just one but
three datasets collected from three different satellite sensors, respectively. Lastly, CanadaFire2023
has a much higher spatial resolution than existing burned area mapping datasets. Specifically, the
Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 datasets have a resolution of 30 meters, while the Sentinel-2 dataset has a
resolution of 10 meters.
Recent years have witnessed progress in the task of burned area mapping with the rapid application of
machine learning models in remote sensing and environmental tasks [ 1,15,3]. In 2015, Alonso-Canas
et al. proposed a global burned area detection algorithm using MERIS imagery and MODIS active
fire data from 2006 to 2008. Later, Hawbaker et al. developed an automated method to detect burned
areas on Landsat imagery for the conterminous U.S. [ 3]. More recently, Zanetti et al. put forward
a burn severity index thresholding approach using multispectral satellite imagery for burned area
mapping. Inspired by this pioneering work, we aim to first build a burned area mapping dataset
focusing on the 2023 wildfires in Canada using satellite imagery from three multispectral platforms
(Landsat-8, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-2) and then create three corresponding benchmarks to train
and evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning models. Specifically, we use semantic segmentation
baseline models, including FCN [ 7], U-Net [ 12], multiscale ResNet [ 4], and SegFormer [ 14]. In
addition, we present our framework to create the CanadaFire2023 dataset and showcase an example
of mapping the burned areas across Canada for the 2023 wildfires, which could be of great value for
carbon emission calculation and climate impact assessment.
2 Framework
As shown in Fig. 1, the framework for creating the burned area mapping dataset CanadaFire2023
across three satellite platforms primarily involves three steps. First, we identify the areas of interest
using data from the Sentinel-3 World Fire Atlas1to efficiently select satellite imagery containing
burned areas in Google Earth Engine. Second, we download the selected images and remove
unsatisfactory imagery, due to clouds or smoke. Third, we manually annotate the satellite imagery
using a labeling platform called Label Studio2based on visual interpretation by human experts.

using Label Studio: (a) Landsat-8, (b) Landsat-9, and (c) Sentinel-2. The Red, Green, and Blue
channels are used for visualization. For each dataset, the two images on the left are the visualized
satellite images, while the two images on the right are the corresponding annotated images, where the
red areas indicate labeled burned areas.
After establishing the three CanadaFire2023 datasets, the associated deep learning benchmarks
involve three stages. Initially, we train four baseline deep learning models using the training data on
the three datasets, respectively. The deep learning framework we adopted is PyTorch. Subsequently,
we generate burn scar maps using trained baseline deep neural networks on the testing data for each
dataset. Finally, we record the corresponding binary segmentation metrics (precision, recall, and
F1-score) for all baseline models across the three annotated imagery datasets.
3 Datasets and Benchmarks
As shown in Fig. 2, CanadaFire2023 contains three subsets: Landsat-8, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-2.
The Landsat-8 dataset consists of 305 images of 30-meter resolution, the Landsat-9 dataset comprises
272 images of 30-meter resolution, and the Sentinel-2 subset includes 828 images of 10-meter
resolution. All imagery was collected between May 1 and November 1, 2023, covering almost all
burning events across Canada during that period. Each Landsat-8 or Landsat-9 image covers an area
of about 185 km ×185 km, while each Sentinel-2 image covers roughly 290 km ×290 km. For each
dataset, 80% of the images were randomly selected for training, and the remaining 20% were used
for evaluation.
3.1 Satellite Imagery Datasets
The active fire data from Sentinel-3 are first used to identify areas of interest. Then, CanadaFire2023
is manually annotated using Label Studio, which is an open-source platform for multiple labeling
tasks. After downloading the imagery from the three data sources, we process them by normalizing
the values for each layer to between 0 and 1. To account for the severity of burned areas caused by
the 2023 Canadian wildfires, we generate the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) using satellite imagery.
The NBR can be calculated using the formula: NBR=NIR−SWIR2
NIR+SWIR2, where NIR represents the Near-
Infrared band and SWIR2 denotes the Shortwave Infrared 2 band. Furthermore, we introduce NDWI
to account for water bodies that often have a dark color in satellite imagery, which appear similar
to burned regions. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) can be calculated using the
formula: NDWI =Green−NIR
Green+NIR. We then stack NBR and NDWI as additional features on top of each
training sample. Therefore, there are nine layers in each input satellite image, including Aerosol,
Blue, Green, Red, NIR, Shortwave Infrared 1 (SWIR1), SWIR2, NBR, and NDWI. Afterwards, four
baseline deep learning models are employed to identify burned areas on the stacked 9-layer data for
the three datasets, respectively.

3.2 Deep Learning Baseline Models
The four classic deep learning models used to create benchmarks are FCN [ 7], U-Net [ 12], Multiscale
ResNet [ 4], and SegFormer [ 14]. These models were selected because they have proven to be effective
for semantic segmentation tasks across various datasets, including Earth observation datasets [ 10,11].
We trained each model for 200 epochs on each dataset, using the Adam optimizer to guide the training
process. We used three metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the deep learning models for burned
area mapping: Precision, Recall, and F1-score, which are standard indices for binary segmentation
tasks. F1-score is the primary metric because it balances precision and recall. As shown in Table
1, Multiscale ResNet achieved the best burned area mapping performance for the Landsat-9 and
Sentinel-2 datasets, while the classic U-Net attained the highest F1-score for the Landsat-8 dataset.
Although these results are used to assess burned area mapping performance, the best-performing
models are likely to produce better burned area maps for the 2023 wildfires across Canada, thereby
enabling more accurate climate impact assessments and more effective disaster management.
3.3 Contribution to Climate Impact Assessment
The CanadaFire2023 datasets could generate non-trivial benefits for various tasks, such as wildfire
analysis, forest management, and climate impact assessment. First, it can provide datasets to
train burned area mapping models for local regions or across Canada, as the datasets cover almost
all biomes that could be affected by wildfires. Second, because CanadaFire2023 contains three
datasets from different satellite-mounted sensors, fusing the three datasets could enable near real-time
and cloud-free updates about wildfires, which are crucial for building a comprehensive wildfire
intelligence platform for tracking fires in forests and directing resources to suppress ongoing fires.
Last but not least, the resulting burn scar maps could serve as a foundation for historical and future
climate impact assessments, including those related to the carbon cycle, permafrost thawing, and
land use and land cover change. For example, the final burned area map shown in Fig. A1 in the
Supplementary Material is produced by merging the burned pixels identified by trained multiscale
ResNets on Landsat and Sentinel data. The total identified burned area is 15.1 million hectares, with
the most severely impacted areas in Quebec province in eastern Canada and the intersection region
of British Columbia, Alberta, and the Northwest Territories in western Canada. Then, we can use
the identified burned area, the remotely sensed data (Landsat-8, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-2), their
derivatives (NBR, NDWI), field samples, among others, to make an accurate estimation of carbon
emissions across Canada.
4 Conclusions
In this paper, we introduce our burned area mapping datasets, CanadaFire2023, for three different
satellite remote sensing platforms to facilitate the development and research in wildfire monitoring,
disaster management, and carbon emission estimation. In addition, we trained four baseline semantic
segmentation models on three CanadaFire2023 datasets and evaluated them using the metrics of
precision, recall, and F1-score. More importantly, these results can serve as benchmarks for other
machine learning and deep learning models. To tackle the task of burned area mapping, we advocate
for more algorithms that consider the special characteristics of satellite imagery and burned area
detection to be designed and compared with the baseline models on CanadaFire2023. Considering
the record-breaking burned area generated by the 2023 wildfires in Canada, and the consequential air
pollution, human evacuation, and forest degradation, we hope this new dataset can help the scientific
4community better understand regional and national climate impacts and provide a data source that
could potentially be used to prevent or suppress such natural disasters from happening again.
