Abstract
The UK’s building stock, responsible for 13% of national greenhouse gas emis-
sions in 2023, plays a crucial role in meeting the country’s ambitious 2030 emis-
sions reduction target. With the UK currently off-track and the building sector’s
emissions reductions slowing since 2014, there is an urgent need for improved
energy modelling and policy development. We introduce a novel dataset for small-
neighbourhood energy modelling in England and Wales to address this challenge.
Covering 614k postcodes, ranging from 5-150 households, our dataset integrates
domestic energy consumption data with variables spanning building characteristics,
local environment, and socio-demographics. This dataset offers a new level of
granularity in national energy analysis. It can provide insights for retrofit planning,
material stock analysis and energy policy, transforming approaches to small-scale
energy analysis and supporting the UK’s climate goals.
1 Introduction and Background
Buildings significantly contribute to global GHG emissions, accounting for 33% of global CO 2
emissions related to energy and processes in 2021 [ 1]. Urban building energy modelling (UBEM)
approaches particularly bottom-up methods, are important for understanding and reducing these
emissions. Bottom-up UBEM can scale to national levels through archetype approaches or building-
level predictions using machine learning [ 2]. These methods utilize existing building stock datasets
[3], [4] or remote sensing data [ 5,6]. However, there’s a notable lack of open-access building-level
energy datasets, with most available data concentrated in US cities [7, 8].
In Europe, the lack of building energy data is primarily due to privacy concerns. While most available
datasets are from the US, the UK has two main open datasets: the National Energy Efficiency Data
Framework (NEED) and the Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) database [ 9]. However, both UK
datasets have significant limitations. NEED’s anonymized nature means insights cannot be geolocated
beyond regional identification, while EPCs suffer from accuracy issues, including over-prediction of
energy intensity and inconsistent ratings across assessments [10].
To address these challenges, we introduce the NEBULA ( Neighbourhood Energy, Buildings, and
Urban Landscapes) dataset, an open-source dataset operating at the small neighbourhood level (5-150
households), using domestic energy data from 2022 containing records for 614k postcodes across
England and Wales. Such data at the postcode level maintains privacy while providing detailed
information about building stock, climate, urbanisation, and socio-demographic factors, making it

already been used in prior works to provide energy benchmarks for cities in the UK [11].
2 Methodology
The NEBULA dataset includes seven themes of variables: building stock, building typology, building
age, region, urbanisation, climate and socio-demographics. These variables are derived from six
datasets, open-source or accessible under academic licenses. Table 1 lists the input data sources and
their licences. In total, NEBULA contains 244 variables (89 relating to the building stock, 124 related
to socio-demographics, 10 to energy and 21 to regional and environmental variables) and is in tabular
format indexed by Postcode. A sample of the variables is given in Table 1 and the current list of
variables and accompanying metadata is provided in the supplementary information.

2.1 Dataset Generation
We now briefly summarise the dataset generation process.
Annual domestic energy consumption data is available at the postcode level in the UK, [ 18], providing
total, median, and mean consumption for gas and electricity in kWh/year. We derived a variety of
variables relating to the building stock per postcode using data from Verisk UKBuildings [ 13] dataset1.
An example of a postcode with the identified domestic buildings is given in Figure 2. We identify
buildings through an ID match and a spatial join between footprints. Variables relating to building
typologies and building age are calculated as percentages at the postcode level. The local climate
variables are Heating and Cooling Degree days (HDD, CDD), calculated from monthly temperature
data from HAD-UK ([ 19]), calculated for summer, winter and annually for 2022. Urbanisation
variables including postcode area and density are calculated using postcode shapefiles and total
building footprint areas and integrate a rural/urban flag from the 2011 census. Socio-demographics
are included through the matching of census data from the 2021 UK census to postcodes.
These attributes were calculated for postcodes that are (a) - fully domestic postcodes, (b) - have
more than 5 gas meters, ensuring the privacy of individuals is not compromised (c) - not "vertical
street" postcodes where multiple postcodes exist over the same spatial area e.g. very large buildings
(d) - were present in all the appropriate mapping files. The resulting dataset is tabular, indexed by
postcode, with all attributes at the postcode level. These constraints limit future analysis to residential
areas and exclude urban centres or mixed-use areas.
2.2 Final Dataset
After processing we apply some filters to ensure a clean sample for energy modelling. Thresholds were
applied to the count of buildings and total building volume of 1-200 and 50-20,000m2respectively.
We also exclude postcodes with a percentage of unknown typologies >10. The resulting 614k
postcodes in the clean sample are split across England and Wales. Summary statistics for key metrics
are given in Table 2.

3 Technical Validation
The main potential errors in the dataset deviation come from errors in the underlying building stock
data. To understand the impact of potential errors, we run a Morris sensitivity analysis on the derived
variable ‘total building floor area’ per postcode. A Morris analysis systematically explores the
parameter space by applying one-at-a-time variations to input parameters [ 20], [21]. We test 10,000
postcodes, with 10 trajectories each, where each trajectory varies the building level floor area and
height by up to 10%. A 10% change in premise area equals a median 457 ±9m2(median ±standard
deviation) absolute change in total postcode built floor area, whilst a 10% change in height equals a
median 99 ±40m2absolute change. Set against the median Y of 2,509m2, the potential variation due
to 10% variation in the premise area is 18 ±0.3%, and in height is 4 ±1.5%.

NebulaDataset . The processed data will be archived and available from https://doi.org/10.
17863/CAM.113850 . The archived version of the data is under review and likely available in early
2025, please email the corresponding author for earlier access to the dataset or the corresponding full
methodology paper.
5 Future Use Cases
The NEBULA dataset is designed to provide a range of variables suitable for neighbourhood energy
modelling. We have used an earlier version of the data to provide energy benchmarks for cities in the
UK [ 11]. The open-source, geolocated nature of the dataset means great potential for the community
to integrate new variables and explore its uses in other domains. We see great potential for future
work in identifying drivers of energy performance, material stock analysis, future overheating risk,
and satellite assessment of neighbourhoods for energy efficiency.
