Synthesis Report
Synthesis Report
An Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
This underlying report, adopted section by section at IPCC Plenary XXVII (Valencia, Spain, 12-17 November 2007),
represents the formally agreed statement of the IPCC concerning key findings and uncertainties contained in the Working
Group contributions to the Fourth Assessment Report.
Based on a draft prepared by:IntroductionIntroduction
26Introduction
This Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out
by the three Working Groups (WGs) of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC). It provides an integrated view of cli-mate change as the final part of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Re-port (AR4).
Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef-
fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while
Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre-
sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un-der different scenarios.
Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the
next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop-

mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per-
spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain-ing key uncertainties in this assessment.

(TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the
linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts fromsocio-economic information and emissions. With increased under-standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkagesalso counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path-ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk
of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.27Introduction
1See http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/ar4-workshops-express-meetings/uncertainty-guidance-note.pdfTreatment of uncertainty
The IPCC uncertainty guidance note1 defines a framework for the treatment of uncertainties across all WGs and in this Synthesis Report.
This framework is broad because the WGs assess material from different disciplines and cover a diversity of approaches to the t reatment of
uncertainty drawn from the literature. The nature of data, indicators and analyses used in the natural sciences is generally di fferent from that
used in assessing technology development or the social sciences. WG I focuses on the former, WG III on the latter, and WG II co vers aspects
of both.
Three different approaches are used to describe uncertainties each with a distinct form of language. Choices among and within t hese three
approaches depend on both the nature of the information available and the authors’ expert judgment of the correctness and compl eteness of
current scientific understanding.
Where uncertainty is assessed qualitatively, it is characterised by providing a relative sense of the amount and quality of evi dence (that is,
information from theory, observations or models indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid) and the degree of agreement (that is,
the level of concurrence in the literature on a particular finding). This approach is used by WG III through a series of self-e xplanatory terms
such as:  high agreement, much evidence;  high agreement, medium evidence; medium agreement, medium evidence; etc .
Where uncertainty is assessed more quantitatively using expert judgement of the correctness of underlying data, models or analy ses, then
the following scale of confidence levels is used to express the assessed chance of a finding being correct: v ery high confidence  at least 9 out
of 10; high confidence  about 8 out of 10;  medium confidence  about 5 out of 10;  low confidence  about 2 out of 10; and  very low confidence  less
than 1 out of 10.
Where uncertainty in specific outcomes is assessed using expert judgment and statistical analysis of a body of evidence (e.g. o bservations
or model results), then the following likelihood ranges are used to express the assessed probability of occurrence: virtually certain  >99%;
extremely likely  >95%; very likely  >90%; likely  >66%; more likely than not  > 50%; about as likely as not  33% to 66%; unlikely  <33%; very
unlikely  <10%; extremely unlikely  <5%; exceptionally unlikely  <1%.
WG II has used a combination of confidence and likelihood assessments and WG I has predominantly used likelihood assessments.
This Synthesis Report follows the uncertainty assessment of the underlying WGs. Where synthesised findings are based on informa tion
from more than one WG, the description of uncertainty used is consistent with that for the components drawn from the respective  WG reports.
Unless otherwise stated, numerical ranges given in square brackets in this report indicate 90% uncertainty intervals (i.e. ther e is an
estimated 5% likelihood that the value could be above the range given in square brackets and 5% likelihood that the value could  be below that
range). Uncertainty intervals are not necessarily symmetric around the best estimate.1
Observed changes in climate and their effectsTopic 1 Observed changes in climate and their effects
301.1 Observations of climate change
Since the TAR, progress in understanding how climate is chang-
ing in space and time has been gained through improvements andextensions of numerous datasets and data analyses, broader geo-graphical coverage, better understanding of uncertainties and a wider
variety of measurements. 
{WGI SPM}
Definitions of climate change
Climate change in IPCC usage refers to a change in the state
of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using statistical tests)
by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties,
and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or
longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether
due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This
usage differs from that in the United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where climate change
refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indi-
rectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global
atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now
evident from observations of increases in global average
air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snowand ice and rising global average sea level (Figure 1.1). 
{WGI
3.2, 4.8, 5.2, 5.5, SPM}
Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the
twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface
temperature (since 1850). The 100-year linear trend (1906-2005)
of 0.74 [0.56 to 0.92]°C is larger than the corresponding trend of0.6 [0.4 to 0.8]°C (1901-2000) given in the TAR (Figure 1.1). Thelinear warming trend over the 50 years from 1956 to 2005 (0.13[0.10 to 0.16]°C per decade) is nearly twice that for the 100 yearsfrom 1906 to 2005. 
{WGI 3.2, SPM}
The temperature increase is widespread over the globe and is
greater at higher northern latitudes (Figure 1.2). Average Arctic tem-peratures have increased at almost twice the global average rate inthe past 100 years. Land regions have warmed faster than the oceans(Figures 1.2 and 2.5). Observations since 1961 show that the aver-age temperature of the global ocean has increased to depths of at
least 3000m and that the ocean has been taking up over 80% of the
heat being added to the climate system. New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospherictemperature show warming rates similar to those observed in sur-face temperature.
 {WGI 3.2, 3.4, 5.2, SPM}
Increases in sea level are  consistent with warming (Figure 1.1).
Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3]mm
per year over 1961 to 2003 and at an average rate of about 3.1 [2.4to 3.8]mm per year from 1993 to 2003. Whether this faster rate for1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variation or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. Since 1993 thermal expansion of the oceans
has contributed about 57% of the sum of the estimated individual
contributions to the sea level rise, with decreases in glaciers and
ice caps contributing about 28% and losses from the polar ice sheetscontributing the remainder. From 1993 to 2003 the sum of theseclimate contributions is consistent within uncertainties with the totalsea level rise that is directly observed. 
{WGI 4.6, 4.8, 5.5, SPM, Table
SPM.1}
Observed decreases in snow and ice extent are also consistent
with warming (Figure 1.1). Satellite data since 1978 show that an-nual average Arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7 [2.1 to 3.3]%per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]%per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow cover on average havedeclined in both hemispheres. The maximum areal extent of sea-
sonally frozen ground has decreased by about 7% in the Northern
Hemisphere since 1900, with decreases in spring of up to 15%.Temperatures at the top of the permafrost layer have generally in-creased since the 1980s in the Arctic by up to 3°C. 
{WGI 3.2, 4.5, 4.6,
4.7, 4.8, 5.5, SPM}
At continental, regional and ocean basin scales, numerous long-
term changes in other aspects of climate have also been observed.
Trends from 1900 to 2005 have been observed in precipitationamount in many large regions. Over this period, precipitation in-creased significantly in eastern parts of North and South America,
northern Europe and northern and central Asia whereas precipita-tion declined in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and
parts of southern Asia. Globally, the area affected by drought has
likely
2 increased since the 1970s. {WGI 3.3, 3.9, SPM}
Some extreme weather events have changed in frequency and/
or intensity over the last 50 years:
/circle6It is very likely  that cold days, cold nights and frosts have be-
come less frequent over most land areas, while hot days and
hot nights have become more frequent. {WGI 3.8, SPM}
/circle6It is likely  that heat waves have become more frequent over
most land areas. {WGI 3.8, SPM}
/circle6It is likely  that the frequency of heavy precipitation events (or
proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls) has increased overmost areas. 
{WGI 3.8, 3.9, SPM}
/circle6It is likely  that the incidence of extreme high sea level3 has
increased at a broad range of sites worldwide since 1975. {WGI
5.5, SPM}
There is observational evidence of an increase in intense tropical
cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, and sugges-
tions of increased intense tropical cyclone activity in some other re-gions where concerns over data quality are greater. Multi-decadal vari-ability and the quality of the tropical cyclone records prior to routinesatellite observations in about 1970 complicate the detection of long-term trends in tropical cyclone activity. 
{WGI 3.8, SPM}
Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second
half of the 20th century were very likely  higher than during any other
50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least
the past 1300 years. {WGI 6.6, SPM}

1.2 Observed effects of climate changes
The statements presented here are based largely on data sets
that cover the period since 1970. The number of studies of observedtrends in the physical and biological environment and their rela-tionship to regional climate changes has increased greatly since theTAR. The quality of the data sets has also improved. There is a
notable lack of geographic balance in data and literature on ob-
served changes, with marked scarcity in developing countries.
{WGII SPM}
These studies have allowed a broader and more confident as-
sessment of the relationship between observed warming and im-pacts than was made in the TAR. That assessment concluded that
“there is high confidence
2 that recent regional changes in tempera-
ture have had discernible impacts on physical and biological sys-tems”. 
{WGII SPM}Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans
shows that many natural systems are being affected by re-gional climate changes, particularly temperature increases.
{WGII SPM}
There is high confidence  that natural systems related to snow, ice
and frozen ground (including permafrost) are affected. Examples are:
/circle6enlargement and increased numbers of glacial lakes {WGII 1.3, SPM}
/circle6increasing ground instability in permafrost regions and rock
avalanches in mountain regions {WGII 1.3, SPM}
/circle6changes in some Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems, including
those in sea-ice biomes, and predators at high levels of the food
web. {WGII 1.3, 4.4, 15.4, SPM}
Based on growing evidence, there is high confidence  that the
following effects on hydrological systems are occurring: increasedrunoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-
fed rivers, and warming of lakes and rivers in many regions, with
effects on thermal structure and water quality. 
{WGII 1.3, 15.2, SPM}Topic 1 Observed changes in climate and their effects

biological systems (terrestrial, marine, and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature ch anges over the period 1970-
2004. A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies. These met the following  criteria: (1) ending in 1990
or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction, as assessed in individual studies. These data
series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the TAR) and contain about 29,000 data series, of which about  28,000 are from European
studies. White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to estimate a temperature trend. The 2 x 2 boxes show  the total number of data
series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM),
Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) glo bal-scale: Terrestrial
(TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and Global (GLO). The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, …, PR) do not add up to the global
(GLO) totals because numbers from regions except Polar do not include the numbers related to Marine and Freshwater (MFW) system s. Locations of large-
area marine changes are not shown on the map. {WGII Figure SPM.1, Figure 1.8, Figure 1.9; WGI Figure 3.9b}

There is very high confidence , based on more evidence from a
wider range of species, that recent warming is strongly affecting
terrestrial biological systems , including such changes as earlier tim-
ing of spring events, such as leaf-unfolding, bird migration andegg-laying; and poleward and upward shifts in ranges in plant andanimal species. Based on satellite observations since the early 1980s,there is high confidence  that there has been a trend in many regions
towards earlier ‘greening’ of vegetation in the spring linked to longer
thermal growing seasons due to recent warming. 
{WGII 1.3, 8.2, 14.2,
SPM}
There is high confidence , based on substantial new evidence,
that observed changes in marine and freshwater biological systemsare associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related
changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels and circulation. These
include: shifts in ranges and changes in algal, plankton and fishabundance in high-latitude oceans; increases in algal and zooplank-ton abundance in high-latitude and high-altitude lakes; and rangechanges and earlier fish migrations in rivers. While there is increas-ing evidence of climate change impacts on coral reefs, separating
the impacts of climate-related stresses from other stresses (e.g. over-
fishing and pollution) is difficult. 
{WGII 1.3, SPM}
Other effects of regional climate changes on natural and
human environments are emerging, although many are dif-ficult to discern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers.
{WGII SPM}
Effects of temperature increases have been documented with
medium confidence  in the following managed and human systems:
/circle6agricultural and forestry management at Northern Hemisphere
higher latitudes, such as earlier spring planting of crops, andalterations in disturbances of forests due to fires and pests 
{WGII
1.3, SPM}
/circle6some aspects of human health, such as excess heat-related
mortality in Europe, changes in infectious disease vectors inparts of Europe, and earlier onset of and increases in seasonalproduction of allergenic pollen in Northern Hemisphere highand mid-latitudes 
{WGII 1.3, 8.2, 8.ES, SPM}
/circle6some human activities in the Arctic (e.g. hunting and shortertravel seasons over snow and ice) and in lower-elevation alpine
areas (such as limitations in mountain sports). {WGII 1.3, SPM }
Sea level rise and human development are together contribut-
ing to losses of coastal wetlands and mangroves and increasingdamage from coastal flooding in many areas. However, based onthe published literature, the impacts have not yet become estab-
lished trends. 
{WGII 1.3, 1.ES, SPM}
1.3 Consistency of changes in physical and
biological systems with warming
Changes in the ocean and on land, including observed decreases
in snow cover and Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent, thinner sea
ice, shorter freezing seasons of lake and river ice, glacier melt, de-
creases in permafrost extent, increases in soil temperatures andborehole temperature profiles, and sea level rise, provide additionalevidence that the world is warming. 
{WGI 3.9}
Of the more than 29,000 observational data series, from 75 stud-
ies, that show significant change in many physical and biological
systems, more than 89% are consistent with the direction of change
expected as a response to warming (Figure 1.2). {WGII 1.4, SPM}
1.4 Some aspects of climate have not been
observed to change
Some aspects of climate appear not to have changed and, for
some, data inadequacies mean that it cannot be determined if they
have changed. Antarctic sea ice extent shows inter-annual variabil-ity and localised changes but no statistically significant averagemulti-decadal trend, consistent with the lack of rise in near-surfaceatmospheric temperatures averaged across the continent. There is
insufficient evidence to determine whether trends exist in some other
variables, for example the meridional overturning circulation (MOC)of the global ocean or small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes,hail, lightning and dust storms. There is no clear trend in the annualnumbers of tropical cyclones.

Causes of changeTopic 2 Causes of change
36Causes of change
This Topic considers both natural and anthropogenic drivers of
climate change, including the chain from greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions to atmospheric concentrations to radiative forcing4 to
climate responses and effects.
2.1 Emissions of long-lived GHGs
The radiative forcing of the climate system is dominated by the
long-lived GHGs, and this section considers those whose emissionsare covered by the UNFCCC.
Global GHG emissions due to human activities have grown
since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70% between1970 and 2004 (Figure 2.1).
5 {WGIII 1.3, SPM}
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic GHG.
Its annual emissions have grown between 1970 and 2004 by about80%, from 21 to 38 gigatonnes (Gt), and represented 77% of total
anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2004 (Figure 2.1). The rate of
growth of CO
2-eq emissions was much higher during the recent
10-year period of 1995-2004 (0.92 GtCO2-eq per year) than during
the previous period of 1970-1994 (0.43 GtCO2-eq per year). {WGIII
1.3, TS.1, SPM}
4Radiative forcing  is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere sys tem and
is an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. In this report radiative forcing values ar e for changes relative to pre-
industrial conditions defined at 1750 and are expressed in watts per square metre (W/m2).
5Includes only carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphurhexafluoride
(SF6), whose emissions are covered by the UNFCCC. These GHGs are weighted by their 100-year Global Warming Potentials (GWPs), using  values
consistent with reporting under the UNFCCC.
6This report uses 100-year GWPs and numerical values consistent with reporting under the UNFCCC.
7Such values may consider only GHGs, or a combination of GHGs and aerosols.Carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions and
concentrations
GHGs differ in their warming influence (radiative forcing) on
the global climate system due to their different radiative prop-
erties and lifetimes in the atmosphere. These warming influ-
ences may be expressed through a common metric based on
the radiative forcing of CO2.
CO2-equivalent emission  is the amount of CO2 emission
that would cause the same time-integrated radiative forcing,
over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a long-
lived GHG or a mixture of GHGs. The equivalent CO2 emis-
sion is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its
Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the given time horizon.6
For a mix of GHGs it is obtained by summing the equivalentCO
2 emissions of each gas. Equivalent CO2 emission is a
standard and useful metric for comparing emissions of dif-
ferent GHGs but does not imply the same climate change
responses (see WGI 2.10).
CO2-equivalent concentration  is the concentration of CO2
that would cause the same amount of radiative forcing as a
given mixture of CO2 and other forcing components.7

and M&Tand M&Tsectoral sources of GHGs in 2004 are considered in Figure 2.1c.
{WGIII 1.3, SPM}
The effect on global emissions of the decrease in global energy
intensity (-33%) during 1970 to 2004 has been smaller than the com-bined effect of global income growth (77%) and global populationgrowth (69%); both drivers of increasing energy-related CO
2 emis-
sions. The long-term trend of declining CO2 emissions per unit of en-
ergy supplied reversed after 2000. {WGIII 1.3, Figure SPM.2, SPM}
Differences in per capita income, per capita emissions and
energy intensity among countries remain significant. In 2004,UNFCCC Annex I countries held a 20% share in world population,produced 57% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product based onPurchasing Power Parity (GDP
PPP) and accounted for 46% of glo-
bal GHG emissions (Figure 2.2). {WGIII 1.3, SPM}
2.2 Drivers of climate change
Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aero-
sols, land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of theclimate system and are drivers of climate change. They affect theabsorption, scattering and emission of radiation within the atmo-
sphere and at the Earth’s surface. The resulting positive or negative
changes in energy balance due to these factors are expressed asradiative forcing
4, which is used to compare warming or cooling
influences on global climate. {WGI TS.2}
Human activities result in emissions of four long-lived GHGs:
CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halocarbons (a group
of gases containing fluorine, chlorine or bromine). Atmospheric
concentrations of GHGs increase when emissions are larger thanremoval processes.
Global atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O
have increased markedly as a result of human activitiessince 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values deter-
mined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years(Figure 2.3). The atmospheric concentrations of CO
2 and CH4
in 2005 exceed by far the natural range over the last 650,000
years. Global increases in CO2 concentrations are due pri-
marily to fossil fuel use, with land-use change providinganother significant but smaller contribution. It is very likely
that the observed increase in CH
4 concentration is predomi-
nantly due to agriculture and fossil fuel use. The increasein N
2O concentration is primarily due to agriculture. {WGI
2.3, 7.3, SPM}
The global atmospheric concentration of CO2 increased from a
pre-industrial value of about 280ppm to 379ppm in 2005. The an-nual CO
2 concentration growth rate was larger during the last 10
years (1995-2005 average: 1.9ppm per year) than it has been sincethe beginning of continuous direct atmospheric measurements
(1960-2005 average: 1.4ppm per year), although there is year-to-
year variability in growth rates. 
{WGI 2.3, 7.3, SPM; WGIII 1.3}
The global atmospheric concentration of CH4 has increased from
a pre-industrial value of about 715ppb to 1732ppb in the early 1990s,and was 1774ppb in 2005. Growth rates have declined since theearly 1990s, consistent with total emissions (sum of anthropogenic
and natural sources) being nearly constant during this period. 
{WGI
2.3, 7.4, SPM}
The global atmospheric N2O concentration increased from a
pre-industrial value of about 270ppb to 319ppb in 2005. {WGI 2.3,
7.4, SPM}
Many halocarbons (including hydrofluorocarbons) have in-
creased from a near-zero pre-industrial background concentration,
primarily due to human activities. {WGI 2.3, SPM; SROC SPM}
There is very high confidence  that the global average net
effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warm-ing, with a radiative forcing of +1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W/m
2
(Figure 2.4). {WGI 2.3, 6.5, 2.9, SPM}
The combined radiative forcing due to increases in CO2, CH4
and N2O is +2.3 [+2.1 to +2.5] W/m2, and its rate of increase duringTopic 2 Causes of change
38the industrial era is very likely  to have been unprecedented in more
than 10,000 years (Figures 2.3 and 2.4). The CO2 radiative forcing
increased by 20% from 1995 to 2005, the largest change for anydecade in at least the last 200 years. 
{WGI 2.3, 6.4, SPM}
Anthropogenic contributions to aerosols (primarily sulphate,
organic carbon, black carbon, nitrate and dust) together produce acooling effect, with a total direct radiative forcing of -0.5 [-0.9 to
-0.1] W/m
2 and an indirect cloud albedo forcing of -0.7 [-1.8 to
-0.3] W/m2. Aerosols also influence precipitation. {WGI 2.4, 2.9, 7.5,
SPM}
In comparison, changes in solar irradiance since 1750 are esti-
mated to have caused a small radiative forcing of +0.12 [+0.06 to+0.30] W/m
2, which is less than half the estimate given in the TAR.
{WGI 2.7, SPM}
2.3 Climate sensitivity and feedbacks
The equilibrium climate sensitivity is a measure of the climate
system response to sustained radiative forcing. It is defined as theequilibrium global average surface warming following a doubling
of CO
2 concentration. Progress since the TAR enables an assess-
ment that climate sensitivity is likely  to be in the range of 2 to 4.5°C
with a best estimate of about 3°C, and is very unlikely  to be less
than 1.5°C. Values substantially higher than 4.5°C cannot be ex-cluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as goodfor those values. 
{WGI 8.6, 9.6, Box 10.2, SPM}
Feedbacks can amplify or dampen the response to a given forc-
ing. Direct emission of water vapour (a greenhouse gas) by humanactivities makes a negligible contribution to radiative forcing. How-ever, as global average temperature increases, tropospheric watervapour concentrations increase and this represents a key positive
feedback but not a forcing of climate change. Water vapour changes
represent the largest feedback affecting equilibrium climate sensi-tivity and are now better understood than in the TAR. Cloud feed-backs remain the largest source of uncertainty. Spatial patterns ofclimate response are largely controlled by climate processes andfeedbacks. For example, sea-ice albedo feedbacks tend to enhance
the high latitude response. 
{WGI 2.8, 8.6, 9.2, TS.2.1.3, TS.2.5, SPM}
Warming reduces terrestrial and ocean uptake of atmospheric
CO2, increasing the fraction of anthropogenic emissions remaining
in the atmosphere. This positive carbon cycle feedback leads tolarger atmospheric CO
2 increases and greater climate change for a
given emissions scenario, but the strength of this feedback effect
varies markedly among models. {WGI 7.3, TS.5.4, SPM; WGII 4.4}
2.4 Attribution of climate change
Attribution evaluates whether observed changes are quantita-
tively consistent with the expected response to external forcings(e.g. changes in solar irradiance or anthropogenic GHGs) and in-
consistent with alternative physically plausible explanations.

Radiative forcing components
Figure 2.4.  Global average radiative forcing (RF) in 2005 (best estimates and 5 to 95% uncertainty ranges) with respect to 1750 for CO2, CH4, N2O and other
important agents and mechanisms, together with the typical geographical extent (spatial scale) of the forcing and the assessed level of scientific understand-
ing (LOSU). Aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions contribute an additional episodic cooling term for a few years following  an eruption. The range for
linear contrails does not include other possible effects of aviation on cloudiness. {WGI Figure SPM.2}
Most of the observed increase in global average tempera-
tures since the mid-20th century is very likely  due to the
observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations.8
This is an advance since the TAR’s conclusion that “most
of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely  to
have been due to the increase in GHG concentrations” (Fig-ure 2.5). 
{WGI 9.4, SPM}
The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean,
together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is ex-
tremely unlikely  that global climate change of the past 50 years can
be explained without external forcing and very likely that it is not
due to known natural causes alone. During this period, the sum ofsolar and volcanic forcings would likely  have produced cooling,
not warming. Warming of the climate system has been detected inchanges in surface and atmospheric temperatures and in tempera-tures of the upper several hundred metres of the ocean. The ob-
served pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric coolingis very likely  due to the combined influences of GHG increases and
stratospheric ozone depletion. It is likely  that increases in GHG
concentrations alone would have caused more warming than ob-
served because volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols have offset
some warming that would otherwise have taken place. 
{WGI 2.9, 3.2,
3.4, 4.8, 5.2, 7.5, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, TS.4.1, SPM}
It is likely  that there has been significant anthropogenic
warming over the past 50 years averaged over each conti-nent (except Antarctica) (Figure 2.5). 
{WGI 3.2, 9.4, SPM}
The observed patterns of warming, including greater warming
over land than over the ocean, and their changes over time, aresimulated only by models that include anthropogenic forcing. Nocoupled global climate model that has used natural forcing onlyhas reproduced the continental mean warming trends in individualcontinents (except Antarctica) over the second half of the 20
th cen-
tury. {WGI 3.2, 9.4, TS.4.2, SPM}

40Global and continental temperature change
Figure 2.5. Comparison of observed continental- and global-scale changes in surface temperature with results simulated by climate models us ing either
natural or both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Decadal averages of observations are shown for the period 1906-2005 (black line) plotted against the

bands show the 5 to 95% range for 19 simulations from five climate models using only the natural forcings due to solar activity  and volcanoes. Red shaded
bands show the 5 to 95% range for 58 simulations from 14 climate models using both natural and anthropogenic forcings. {WGI Fig ure SPM.4}
Difficulties remain in simulating and attributing observed tem-
perature changes at smaller scales. On these scales, natural climatevariability is relatively larger, making it harder to distinguish changes
expected due to external forcings. Uncertainties in local forcings,
such as those due to aerosols and land-use change, and feedbacksalso make it difficult to estimate the contribution of GHG increasesto observed small-scale temperature changes. 
{WGI 8.3, 9.4, SPM}
Advances since the TAR show that discernible human in-
fluences extend beyond average temperature to other as-
pects of climate, including temperature extremes and wind
patterns. {WGI 9.4, 9.5, SPM}Temperatures of the most extreme hot nights, cold nights and
cold days are likely  to have increased due to anthropogenic forcing.
It is more likely than not that anthropogenic forcing has increased
the risk of heat waves. Anthropogenic forcing is likely  to have con-
tributed to changes in wind patterns, affecting extra-tropical stormtracks and temperature patterns in both hemispheres. However, theobserved changes in the Northern Hemisphere circulation are largerthan simulated by models in response to 20
th century forcing change.
{WGI 3.5, 3.6, 9.4, 9.5, 10.3, SPM}
It is very likely  that the response to anthropogenic forcing con-
tributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century.

on the hydrological cycle, including the observed large-scale pat-
terns of changes in land precipitation over the 20th century. It is
more likely than not  that human influence has contributed to a glo-
bal trend towards increases in area affected by drought since the1970s and the frequency of heavy precipitation events. 
{WGI 3.3,
5.5, 9.5, TS.4.1, TS.4.3}
Anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has
likely  had a discernible influence at the global scale on ob-
served changes in many physical and biological systems.
{WGII 1.4}
A synthesis of studies strongly demonstrates that the spatial
agreement between regions of significant warming across the globeand the locations of significant observed changes in many natural
systems consistent with warming is very unlikely  to be due solely
to natural variability of temperatures or natural variability of thesystems. Several modelling studies have linked some specific re-
sponses in physical and biological systems to anthropogenic warm-
ing, but only a few such studies have been performed. Taken to-gether with evidence of significant anthropogenic warming overthe past 50 years averaged over each continent (except Antarctica),it is likely  that anthropogenic warming over the last three decades
has had a discernible influence on many natural systems. 
{WGI 3.2,
9.4, SPM; WGII 1.4, SPM}
Limitations and gaps currently prevent more complete attribu-
tion of the causes of observed natural system responses to anthro-pogenic warming. The available analyses are limited in the numberof systems, length of records and locations considered. Natural tem-perature variability is larger at the regional than the global scale,
thus affecting identification of changes to external forcing. At the re-
gional scale, other non-climate factors (such as land-use change, pol-lution and invasive species) are influential.

Climate change and its impacts in the near and
long term under different scenariosTopic 3 Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
443.1 Emissions scenarios
There is high agreement and much evidence9 that with cur-
rent climate change mitigation policies and related sustain-able development practices, global GHG emissions will con-tinue to grow over the next few decades. Baseline emis-sions scenarios published since the IPCC Special Reporton Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 2000) are comparable in
range to those presented in SRES (see Box on SRES sce-
narios and Figure 3.1).
10 {WGIII 1.3, 3.2, SPM}
The SRES scenarios project an increase of baseline global GHG
emissions by a range of 9.7 to 36.7 GtCO2-eq (25 to 90%) between
2000 and 2030. In these scenarios, fossil fuels are projected to
maintain their dominant position in the global energy mix to 2030and beyond. Hence CO
2 emissions from energy use between 2000
and 2030 are projected to grow 40 to 110% over that period. {WGIII
1.3, SPM}
Studies published since SRES (i.e. post-SRES scenarios) have
used lower values for some drivers for emissions, notably popula-
tion projections. However, for those studies incorporating these newpopulation projections, changes in other drivers, such as economicgrowth, result in little change in overall emission levels. Economicgrowth projections for Africa, Latin America and the Middle Eastto 2030 in post-SRES baseline scenarios are lower than in SRES,
but this has only minor effects on global economic growth and over-
all emissions. 
{WGIII 3.2, TS.3, SPM}
Aerosols have a net cooling effect and the representation of
aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions, including sulphur diox-ide, black carbon and organic carbon, has improved in the post-
SRES scenarios. Generally, these emissions are projected to be lower
than reported in SRES. 
{WGIII 3.2, TS.3, SPM}
Available studies indicate that the choice of exchange rate for

9Agreement/evidence statements in italics represent calibrated expressions of uncertainty and confidence. See Box ‘Treatment of uncertainty’ in the Intro-
duction for an explanation of these terms.
10Baseline scenarios do not include additional climate policies above current ones; more recent studies differ with respect to UN FCCC and Kyoto Protocol
inclusion. Emission pathways of mitigation scenarios are discussed in Topic 5.
11Since the TAR, there has been a debate on the use of different exchange rates in emissions scenarios. Two metrics are used to c ompare GDP between
countries. Use of MER is preferable for analyses involving internationally traded products. Use of PPP is preferable for analys es involving comparisons of
income between countries at very different stages of development. Most of the monetary units in this report are expressed in ME R. This reflects the large
majority of emissions mitigation literature that is calibrated in MER. When monetary units are expressed in PPP , this is denote d by GDPPPP. {WGIII SPM}SRES scenarios
SRES refers to the scenarios described in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 2000). The SRES scenarios are
grouped into four scenario families (A1, A2, B1 and B2) that explore alternative development pathways, covering a wide range of
demographic, economic and technological driving forces and resulting GHG emissions. The SRES scenarios do not include additiona l
climate policies above current ones. The emissions projections are widely used in the assessments of future climate change, and  their
underlying assumptions with respect to socio-economic, demographic and technological change serve as inputs to many recent clim ate
change vulnerability and impact assessments. {WGI 10.1; WGII 2.4; WGIII TS.1, SPM}
The A1 storyline assumes a world of very rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks in mid-century and rapid introdu c-
tion of new and more efficient technologies. A1 is divided into three groups that describe alternative directions of technologi cal change:
fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy resources (A1T) and a balance across all sources (A1B). B1 describes a convergent wo rld,
with the same global population as A1, but with more rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information econ omy.
B2 describes a world with intermediate population and economic growth, emphasising local solutions to economic, social, and env iron-
mental sustainability. A2 describes a very heterogeneous world with high population growth, slow economic development and slow
technological change. No likelihood has been attached to any of the SRES scenarios. {WGIII TS.1, SPM}Figure 3.1.  Global GHG emissions (in GtCO2-eq per year) in the absence of

3.2 Projections of future changes in climate
For the next two decades a warming of about 0.2°C per de-
cade is projected for a range of SRES emissions scenarios.Even if the concentrations of all GHGs and aerosols hadbeen kept constant at year 2000 levels, a further warming ofabout 0.1°C per decade would be expected. Afterwards, tem-perature projections increasingly depend on specific emis-
sions scenarios (Figure 3.2). 
{WGI 10.3, 10.7; WGIII 3.2}
Since the IPCC’s first report in 1990, assessed projections have
suggested global averaged temperature increases between about 0.15and 0.3°C per decade from 1990 to 2005. This can now be com-pared with observed values of about 0.2°C per decade, strengthen-ing confidence in near-term projections. 
{WGI 1.2, 3.2}
3.2.1 21st century global changes
Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates would
cause further warming and induce many changes in the glo-bal climate system during the 21
st century that would very
likely  be larger than those observed during the 20th century.
{WGI 10.3}
Advances in climate change modelling now enable best esti-
mates and likely  assessed uncertainty ranges to be given for pro-
jected warming for different emissions scenarios. Table 3.1 showsbest estimates and likely  ranges for global average surface air warm-
ing for the six SRES marker emissions scenarios (including cli-mate-carbon cycle feedbacks). 
{WGI 10.5}Although these projections are broadly consistent with the span
quoted in the TAR (1.4 to 5.8°C), they are not directly comparable.
Assessed upper ranges for temperature projections are larger than
in the TAR mainly because the broader range of models now avail-able suggests stronger climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. For the A2scenario, for example, the climate-carbon cycle feedback increasesthe corresponding global average warming at 2100 by more than1°C. Carbon feedbacks are discussed in Topic 2.3. 
{WGI 7.3, 10.5,
SPM}
Because understanding of some important effects driving sea
level rise is too limited, this report does not assess the likelihood,nor provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise.Model-based projections of global average sea level rise at the endof the 21
st century (2090-2099) are shown in Table 3.1. For each
scenario, the mid-point of the range in Table 3.1 is within 10% of
the TAR model average for 2090-2099. The ranges are narrowerthan in the TAR mainly because of improved information aboutsome uncertainties in the projected contributions.
12 The sea level
projections do not include uncertainties in climate-carbon cyclefeedbacks nor do they include the full effects of changes in ice
sheet flow, because a basis in published literature is lacking. There-
fore the upper values of the ranges given are not to be consideredupper bounds for sea level rise. The projections include a contribu-tion due to increased ice flow from Greenland and Antarctica at therates observed for 1993-2003, but these flow rates could increaseor decrease in the future. If this contribution were to grow linearly
with global average temperature change, the upper ranges of sea
level rise for SRES scenarios shown in Table 3.1 would increase by0.1 to 0.2m.

463.2.2 21st century regional changes
There is now higher confidence than in the TAR in projected
patterns of warming and other regional-scale features, in-
cluding changes in wind patterns, precipitation and someaspects of extremes and sea ice. 
{WGI 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 9.4, 9.5,
10.3, 11.1}
Projected warming in the 21st century shows scenario-indepen-
dent geographical patterns similar to those observed over the past
several decades. Warming is expected to be greatest over land and
at most high northern latitudes, and least over the Southern Ocean(near Antarctica) and northern North Atlantic, continuing recentobserved trends (Figure 3.2 right panels). 
{WGI 10.3, SPM}
Snow cover area is projected to contract. Widespread increases
in thaw depth are projected over most permafrost regions. Sea ice
is projected to shrink in both the Arctic and Antarctic under all
SRES scenarios. In some projections, Arctic late-summer sea icedisappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21
st century. {WGI
10.3, 10.6, SPM; WGII 15.3.4}
It is very likely  that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy pre-
cipitation events will become more frequent. {SYR Table 3.2; WGI
10.3, SPM}
Based on a range of models, it is likely  that future tropical cy-
clones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense, withlarger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associatedwith ongoing increases of tropical sea-surface temperatures. Thereis less confidence in projections of a global decrease in numbers of
tropical cyclones. The apparent increase in the proportion of veryintense storms since 1970 in some regions is much larger than simu-
lated by current models for that period. 
{WGI 3.8, 9.5, 10.3, SPM}
Extra-tropical storm tracks are projected to move poleward, with
consequent changes in wind, precipitation and temperature patterns,continuing the broad pattern of observed trends over the last half-century. 
{WGI 3.6, 10.3, SPM}
Since the TAR there is an improving understanding of projected
patterns of precipitation. Increases in the amount of precipitation
are very likely  in high-latitudes, while decreases are likely  in most
subtropical land regions (by as much as about 20% in the A1B sce-nario in 2100, Figure 3.3), continuing observed patterns in recenttrends. 
{WGI 3.3, 8.3, 9.5, 10.3, 11.2-11.9, SPM}
3.2.3 Changes beyond the 21st century
Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue
for centuries due to the time scales associated with climate
processes and feedbacks, even if GHG concentrations wereto be stabilised. 
{WGI 10.4, 10.5, 10.7, SPM}
If radiative forcing were to be stabilised, keeping all the radia-
tive forcing agents constant at B1 or A1B levels in 2100, modelexperiments show that a further increase in global average tem-
perature of about 0.5°C would still be expected by 2200. In addi-
tion, thermal expansion alone would lead to 0.3 to 0.8m of sealevel rise by 2300 (relative to 1980-1999). Thermal expansion wouldcontinue for many centuries, due to the time required to transportheat into the deep ocean.

Contraction of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to continue
to contribute to sea level rise after 2100. Current models suggestice mass losses increase with temperature more rapidly than gains
due to increased precipitation and that the surface mass balance
becomes negative (net ice loss) at a global average warming (rela-tive to pre-industrial values) in excess of 1.9 to 4.6°C. If such anegative surface mass balance were sustained for millennia, thatwould lead to virtually complete elimination of the Greenland icesheet and a resulting contribution to sea level rise of about 7m. The
corresponding future temperatures in Greenland (1.9 to 4.6°C glo-
bal) are comparable to those inferred for the last interglacial period125,000 years ago, when palaeoclimatic information suggests re-ductions of polar land ice extent and 4 to 6m of sea level rise. 
{WGI
6.4, 10.7, SPM}
Dynamical processes related to ice flow – which are not in-
cluded in current models but suggested by recent observations –could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to warming, in-
creasing future sea level rise. Understanding of these processes islimited and there is no consensus on their magnitude. 
{WGI 4.6, 10.7,
SPM}
Current global model studies project that the Antarctic ice sheet
will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and gain massdue to increased snowfall. However, net loss of ice mass could oc-cur if dynamical ice discharge dominates the ice sheet mass bal-ance. 
{WGI 10.7, SPM}
Both past and future anthropogenic CO2 emissions will con-
tinue to contribute to warming and sea level rise for more than amillennium, due to the time scales required for the removal of thisgas from the atmosphere.

comparable to SRES B1 and A1B by 2100 (600 and 850 ppm CO2-eq; category IV and V), assessed models project that about 65 to 70% of the estimated

More specific information is now available across a wide
range of systems and sectors concerning the nature of fu-ture impacts, including some fields not covered in previousassessments. 
{WGII TS.4, SPM}
The following is a selection of key findings14 regarding the
impacts of climate change on systems, sectors and regions, as well
as some findings on vulnerability15, for the range of climate changes
projected over the 21st century. Unless otherwise stated, the confi-
dence level in the projections is high. Global average temperature
increases are given relative to 1980-1999. Additional informationon impacts can be found in the WG II report.

3.3.1 Impacts on systems and sectors
Ecosystems
/circle6The resilience of many ecosystems is  likely  to be exceeded this
century by an unprecedented combination of climate change,associated disturbances (e.g. flooding, drought, wildfire, insects,ocean acidification) and other global change drivers (e.g. land-use change, pollution, fragmentation of natural systems, over-
exploitation of resources).
 {WGII 4.1-4.6, SPM}
/circle6Over the course of this century, net carbon uptake by terrestrial
ecosystems is likely  to peak before mid-century and then weaken
or even reverse16, thus amplifying climate change. {WGII 4.ES,
Figure 4.2, SPM}
/circle6Approximately 20 to 30% of plant and animal species assessed
so far are likely  to be at increased risk of extinction if increases
in global average temperature exceed 1.5 to 2.5°C ( medium con-
fidence ). {WGII 4.ES, Figure 4.2, SPM}
/circle6For increases in global average temperature exceeding 1.5 to
2.5°C and in concomitant atmospheric CO2 concentrations, there
are projected to be major changes in ecosystem structure and
function, species’ ecological interactions and shifts in species’geographical ranges, with predominantly negative consequencesfor biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services, e.g. waterand food supply. 
{WGII 4.4, Box TS.6, SPM}
Food
/circle6Crop productivity is projected to increase slightly at mid- to
high latitudes for local mean temperature increases of up to 1to 3°C depending on the crop, and then decrease beyond that insome regions ( medium confidence ). 
{WGII 5.4, SPM}
/circle6At lower latitudes, especially in seasonally dry and tropical
regions, crop productivity is projected to decrease for even small
local temperature increases (1 to 2°C), which would increasethe risk of hunger ( medium confidence ). 
{WGII 5.4, SPM}
/circle6Globally, the potential for food production is projected to in-
crease with increases in local average temperature over a rangeof 1 to 3°C, but above this it is projected to decrease ( medium
confidence ). {WGII 5.4, 5.5, SPM}
Coasts
/circle6Coasts are projected to be exposed to increasing risks, includ-
ing coastal erosion, due to climate change and sea level rise.The effect will be exacerbated by increasing human-inducedpressures on coastal areas ( very high confidence ). 
{WGII 6.3, 6.4,
SPM}
/circle6By the 2080s, many millions more people than today are pro-
jected to experience floods every year due to sea level rise. Thenumbers affected will be largest in the densely populated andlow-lying megadeltas of Asia and Africa while small islandsare especially vulnerable ( very high confidence ). 
{WGII 6.4, 6.5,
Table 6.11, SPM}
Industry, settlements and society
/circle6The most vulnerable industries, settlements and societies are
generally those in coastal and river flood plains, those whoseeconomies are closely linked with climate-sensitive resources
and those in areas prone to extreme weather events, especially
where rapid urbanisation is occurring. 
{WGII 7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5,
SPM}
/circle6Poor communities can be especially vulnerable, in particular
those concentrated in high-risk areas. {WGII 7.2, 7.4, 5.4, SPM}
Health
/circle6The health status of millions of people is projected to be af-
fected through, for example, increases in malnutrition; increaseddeaths, diseases and injury due to extreme weather events; in-creased burden of diarrhoeal diseases; increased frequency ofcardio-respiratory diseases due to higher concentrations of
ground-level ozone in urban areas related to climate change;
and the altered spatial distribution of some infectious diseases.
{WGI 7.4, Box 7.4; WGII 8.ES, 8.2, 8.4, SPM}
/circle6Climate change is projected to bring some benefits in temper-
ate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and somemixed effects such as changes in range and transmission poten-
tial of malaria in Africa. Overall it is expected that benefits will
be outweighed by the negative health effects of rising tempera-tures, especially in developing countries. 
{WGII 8.4, 8.7, 8ES, SPM}
/circle6Critically important will be factors that directly shape the health
of populations such as education, health care, public health ini-tiatives, and infrastructure and economic development. 
{WGII

Water
/circle6Water impacts are key for all sectors and regions. These are
discussed below in the Box ‘Climate change and water’.
14Criteria of choice: magnitude and timing of impact, confidence in the assessment, representative coverage of the system, sector  and region.
15Vulnerability to climate change is the degree to which systems are susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse impacts.
16Assuming continued GHG emissions at or above current rates and other global changes including land-use changes.49Topic 3 Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
Climate change and water
Climate change is expected to exacerbate current stresses on water resources from population growth and economic and land-use
change, including urbanisation. On a regional scale, mountain snow pack, glaciers and small ice caps play a crucial role in fre shwater
availability. Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate
throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by
meltwater from major mountain ranges (e.g. Hindu-Kush, Himalaya, Andes), where more than one-sixth of the world population cur-
rently lives. {WGI 4.1, 4.5; WGII 3.3, 3.4, 3.5}
Changes in precipitation (Figure 3.3) and temperature (Figure 3.2) lead to changes in runoff (Figure 3.5) and water availabilit y.
Runoff is projected with high confidence  to increase by 10 to 40% by mid-century at higher latitudes and in some wet tropical areas,
including populous areas in East and South-East Asia, and decrease by 10 to 30% over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and dry
tropics, due to decreases in rainfall and higher rates of evapotranspiration. There is also high confidence  that many semi-arid areas
(e.g. the Mediterranean Basin, western United States, southern Africa and north-eastern Brazil) will suffer a decrease in water  re-
sources due to climate change. Drought-affected areas are projected to increase in extent, with the potential for adverse impac ts on
multiple sectors, e.g. agriculture, water supply, energy production and health. Regionally, large increases in irrigation water  demand as
a result of climate changes are projected. {WGI 10.3, 11.2-11.9; WGII 3.4, 3.5, Figure 3.5, TS.4.1, Box TS.5, SPM}
The negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh its benefits ( high confidence ). Areas in which runoff is
projected to decline face a reduction in the value of the services provided by water resources ( very high confidence ). The beneficial
impacts of increased annual runoff in some areas are likely  to be tempered by negative effects of increased precipitation variability and
seasonal runoff shifts on water supply, water quality and flood risk. {WGII 3.4, 3.5, TS.4.1}
Available research suggests a significant future increase in heavy rainfall events in many regions, including some in which the  mean
rainfall is projected to decrease. The resulting increased flood risk poses challenges to society, physical infrastructure and water quality.
It is likely  that up to 20% of the world population will live in areas where river flood potential could increase by the 2080s. Increases i n
the frequency and severity of floods and droughts are projected to adversely affect sustainable development. Increased temperat ures
will further affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of freshwater lakes and rivers, with predominantly adverse  impacts on
many individual freshwater species, community composition and water quality. In coastal areas, sea level rise will exacerbate w ater
resource constraints due to increased salinisation of groundwater supplies. {WGI 11.2-11.9; WGII 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.4}
Projections and model consistency of relative changes in runoff by the end of the 21st century
Figure 3.5.  Large-scale relative changes in annual runoff (water availability, in percent) for the period 2090-2099, relative to 1980-1999 . Values
represent the median of 12 climate models using the SRES A1B scenario. White areas are where less than 66% of the 12 models agr ee on the sign of
change and hatched areas are where more than 90% of models agree on the sign of change. The quality of the simulation of the ob served large-scale
20th century runoff is used as a basis for selecting the 12 models from the multi-model ensemble. The global map of annual runoff i llustrates a large
scale and is not intended to refer to smaller temporal and spatial scales. In areas where rainfall and runoff is very low (e.g.  desert areas), small changes
in runoff can lead to large percentage changes. In some regions, the sign of projected changes in runoff differs from recently observed trends. In some
areas with projected increases in runoff, different seasonal effects are expected, such as increased wet season runoff and decr eased dry season
runoff. Studies using results from few climate models can be considerably different from the results presented here. {WGII Figu re 3.4, adjusted to match
the assumptions of Figure SYR 3.3; WGII 3.3.1, 3.4.1, 3.5.1}
Topic 3 Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
5017Unless stated explicitly, all entries are from WG II SPM text, and are either very high confidence  or high confidence  statements, reflecting different sectors
(agriculture, ecosystems, water, coasts, health, industry and settlements). The WG II SPM refers to the source of the statement s, timelines and tempera-
tures. The magnitude and timing of impacts that will ultimately be realised will vary with the amount and rate of climate chang e, emissions scenarios,
development pathways and adaptation.Studies since the TAR have enabled more systematic un-
derstanding of the timing and magnitude of impacts related
to differing amounts and rates of climate change. {WGII SPM}
Examples of this new information for systems and sectors are
presented in Figure 3.6. The upper panel shows impacts increasingwith increasing temperature change. Their estimated magnitude andtiming is also affected by development pathways (lower panel).
{WGII SPM}
Depending on circumstances, some of the impacts shown in Fig-
ure 3.6 could be associated with ‘key vulnerabilities’, based on a num-ber of criteria in the literature (magnitude, timing, persistence/reversibility, the potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likeli-hood and ‘importance’ of the impacts) (see Topic 5.2). 
{WGII SPM}
3.3.2 Impacts on regions17
Africa
/circle6By 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected
to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change.
{WGII 9.4, SPM}
/circle6By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture
could be reduced by up to 50%. Agricultural production, in-cluding access to food, in many African countries is projected
to be severely compromised. This would further adversely af-
fect food security and exacerbate malnutrition. 
{WGII 9.4, SPM}
/circle6Towards the end of the 21st century, projected sea level rise
will affect low-lying coastal areas with large populations. Thecost of adaptation could amount to at least 5 to 10% of GDP.
{WGII 9.4, SPM}
/circle6By 2080, an increase of 5 to 8% of arid and semi-arid land in
Africa is projected under a range of climate scenarios ( high
confidence ). {WGII Box TS.6, 9.4.4}
Asia
/circle6By the 2050s, freshwater availability in Central, South, East
and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins, is pro-
jected to decrease. {WGII 10.4, SPM}
/circle6Coastal areas, especially heavily populated megadelta regions
in South, East and South-East Asia, will be at greatest risk dueto increased flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas,flooding from the rivers. 
{WGII 10.4, SPM}
/circle6Climate change is projected to compound the pressures on natu-
ral resources and the environment associated with rapidurbanisation, industrialisation and economic development. 
{WGII
10.4, SPM}
/circle6Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease pri-
marily associated with floods and droughts are expected to rise
in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in
the hydrological cycle. {WGII 10.4, SPM}
Australia and New Zealand
/circle6By 2020, significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur
in some ecologically rich sites, including the Great Barrier Reef
and Queensland Wet Tropics. {WGII 11.4, SPM}/circle6By 2030, water security problems are projected to intensify in
southern and eastern Australia and, in New Zealand, in
Northland and some eastern regions. {WGII 11.4, SPM}
/circle6By 2030, production from agriculture and forestry is projected
to decline over much of southern and eastern Australia, andover parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased droughtand fire. However, in New Zealand, initial benefits are pro-jected in some other regions. 
{WGII 11.4, SPM}
/circle6By 2050, ongoing coastal development and population growth
in some areas of Australia and New Zealand are projected toexacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the sever-ity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding. 
{WGII 11.4,
SPM}
Europe
/circle6Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in
Europe’s natural resources and assets. Negative impacts willinclude increased risk of inland flash floods and more frequentcoastal flooding and increased erosion (due to storminess andsea level rise). 
{WGII 12.4, SPM}
/circle6Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover
and winter tourism, and extensive species losses (in some areasup to 60% under high emissions scenarios by 2080). 
{WGII 12.4,
SPM}
/circle6In southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen con-
ditions (high temperatures and drought) in a region already vul-
nerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability,
hydropower potential, summer tourism and, in general, cropproductivity. 
{WGII 12.4, SPM}
/circle6Climate change is also projected to increase the health risks
due to heat waves and the frequency of wildfires. {WGII 12.4,
SPM}
Latin America
/circle6By mid-century, increases in temperature and associated de-
creases in soil water are projected to lead to gradual replace-ment of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia. Semi-
arid vegetation will tend to be replaced by arid-land vegeta-
tion. 
{WGII 13.4, SPM}
/circle6There is a risk of significant biodiversity loss through species
extinction in many areas of tropical Latin America. {WGII 13.4,
SPM}
/circle6Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease
and livestock productivity to decline, with adverse consequences
for food security. In temperate zones, soybean yields are pro-
jected to increase. Overall, the number of people at risk of hun-ger is projected to increase ( medium confidence ). 
{WGII 13.4,
Box TS.6}
/circle6Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of gla-
ciers are projected to significantly affect water availability for
human consumption, agriculture and energy generation. {WGII

The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the
ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in pH of 0.1units. Increasing atmospheric CO
2 concentrations lead to further
acidification. Projections based on SRES scenarios give a reduc-tion in average global surface ocean pH of between 0.14 and 0.35
units over the 21
st century. While the effects of observed ocean acidi-
fication on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented, the pro-gressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative im-pacts on marine shell-forming organisms (e.g. corals) and their de-pendent species.

{WGI 10.6}
3.4 Risk of abrupt or irreversible changes
Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that
are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and
magnitude of the climate change. {WGII 12.6, 19.3, 19.4, SPM}
Abrupt climate change on decadal time scales is normally
thought of as involving ocean circulation changes. In addition onlonger time scales, ice sheet and ecosystem changes may also play
a role. If a large-scale abrupt climate change were to occur, its im-pact could be quite high (see Topic 5.2). 
{WGI 8.7, 10.3, 10.7; WGII
4.4, 19.3}
Partial loss of ice sheets on polar land and/or the thermal ex-
pansion of seawater over very long time scales could imply metres
of sea level rise, major changes in coastlines and inundation oflow-lying areas, with greatest effects in river deltas and low-lyingTopic 3 Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
54islands. Current models project that such changes would occur over
very long time scales (millennial) if a global temperature increase
of 1.9 to 4.6°C (relative to pre-industrial) were to be sustained.
Rapid sea level rise on century time scales cannot be excluded.
{SYR 3.2.3; WGI 6.4, 10.7; WGII 19.3, SPM}
Climate change is  likely  to lead to some irreversible impacts.
There is medium confidence  that approximately 20 to 30% of spe-
cies assessed so far are likely  to be at increased risk of extinction if
increases in global average warming exceed 1.5 to 2.5°C (relative
to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceedsabout 3.5°C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40to 70% of species assessed) around the globe. 
{WGII 4.4, Figure SPM.2}Based on current model simulations, it is very likely  that the
meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the Atlantic Ocean
will slow down during the 21st century; nevertheless temperatures
in the region are projected to increase. It is very unlikely  that the
MOC will undergo a large abrupt transition during the 21stcentury.
Longer-term changes in the MOC cannot be assessed with confi-dence. 
{WGI 10.3, 10.7; WGII Figure, Table TS.5, SPM.2}
Impacts of large-scale and persistent changes in the MOC are
likely  to include changes in marine ecosystem productivity, fisher-
ies, ocean CO2 uptake, oceanic oxygen concentrations and terres-
trial vegetation. Changes in terrestrial and ocean CO2 uptake may
feed back on the climate system. {WGII 12.6, 19.3, Figure SPM.2}4
Adaptation and mitigation options and responses,
and the inter-relationship with sustainabledevelopment, at global and regional levelsTopic 4 Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the inter-relationship with sustainable development, at global and regional levels
564.1 Responding to climate change
Societies can respond to climate change by adapting to its impacts
and by reducing GHG emissions (mitigation), thereby reducing therate and magnitude of change. This Topic focuses on adaptation andmitigation options that can be implemented over the next two to threedecades, and their inter-relationship with sustainable development.These responses can be complementary. Topic 5 addresses their comple-
mentary roles on a more conceptual basis over a longer timeframe.
The capacity to adapt and mitigate is dependent on socio-eco-
nomic and environmental circumstances and the availability of in-formation and technology
20. However, much less information is
available about the costs and effectiveness of adaptation measuresthan about mitigation measures. 
{WGII 17.1, 17.3; WGIII 1.2}
4.2 Adaptation options
Adaptation can reduce vulnerability, both in the short and
the long term. {WGII 17.2, 18.1, 18.5, 20.3, 20.8}
Vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by other
stresses. These arise from, for example, current climate hazards,
poverty, unequal access to resources, food insecurity, trends in eco-
nomic globalisation, conflict and incidence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. 
{WGII 7.2, 7.4, 8.3, 17.3, 20.3, 20.4, 20.7, SPM}
Societies across the world have a long record of adapting and
reducing their vulnerability to the impacts of weather- and climate-related events such as floods, droughts and storms. Nevertheless,
additional adaptation measures will be required at regional and lo-
cal levels to reduce the adverse impacts of projected climate changeand variability, regardless of the scale of mitigation undertaken overthe next two to three decades.  However, adaptation alone is notexpected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change,especially not over the long term as most impacts increase in mag-
nitude. 
{WGII 17.2, SPM; WGIII 1.2}
A wide array of adaptation options is available, but more ex-
tensive adaptation than is currently occurring is required to reducevulnerability to climate change. There are barriers, limits and costs,which are not fully understood. Some planned adaptation is alreadyoccurring on a limited basis. Table 4.1 provides examples of planned
20Technology is defined as the practical application of knowledge to achieve particular tasks that employs both technical artefac ts (hardware, equipment)
and (social) information (‘software’, know-how for production and use of artefacts).adaptation options by sector. Many adaptation actions have mul-
tiple drivers, such as economic development and poverty allevia-
tion, and are embedded within broader development, sectoral, re-
gional and local planning initiatives such as water resources plan-ning, coastal defence and disaster risk reduction strategies.  Ex-amples of this approach are the Bangladesh National Water Man-agement Plan and the coastal defence plans of The Netherlandsand Norway, which incorporate specific climate change scenarios.
{WGII 1.3, 5.5.2, 11.6, 17.2}
Comprehensive estimates of the costs and benefits of adapta-
tion at the global level are limited in number. However, the numberof adaptation cost and benefit estimates at the regional and projectlevels for impacts on specific sectors, such as agriculture, energydemand for heating and cooling, water resources management and
infrastructure, is growing. Based on these studies there is high con-
fidence  that there are viable adaptation options that can be imple-
mented in some of these sectors at low cost and/or with high ben-efit-cost ratios. Empirical research also suggests that higher ben-efit-cost ratios can be achieved by implementing some adaptationmeasures at an early stage compared to retrofitting long-lived in-
frastructure at a later date. 
{WGII 17.2}
Adaptive capacity is intimately connected to social and eco-
nomic development, but it is not evenly distributed acrossand within societies. 
{WGII 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 17.3}
The capacity to adapt is dynamic and is influenced by a society’s
productive base, including natural and man-made capital assets,
social networks and entitlements, human capital and institutions,
governance, national income, health and technology. It is also af-fected by multiple climate and non-climate stresses, as well as de-velopment policy. 
{WGII 17.3}
Recent studies reaffirm the TAR finding that adaptation will be
vital and beneficial. However, financial, technological, cognitive,
behavioural, political, social, institutional and cultural constraints limit
both the implementation and effectiveness of adaptation measures.Even societies with high adaptive capacity remain vulnerable to cli-mate change, variability and extremes. For example, a heat wave in2003 caused high levels of mortality in European cities (especiallyamong the elderly), and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 caused large hu-
man and financial costs in the United States.

584.3 Mitigation options
Both bottom-up and top-down studies21 indicate that there
is high agreement and much evidence  of substantial eco-
nomic potential21 for the mitigation of global GHG emissions
over the coming decades that could offset the projectedgrowth of global emissions or reduce emissions below cur-
rent levels. 
{WGIII 11.3, SPM}
Figure 4.1 compares global economic mitigation potential in
2030 with the projected emissions increase from 2000 to 2030.Bottom-up studies suggest that mitigation opportunities with netnegative costs
22 have the potential to reduce emissions by about 6
GtCO2-eq/yr in 2030. Realising these requires dealing with imple-
mentation barriers. The economic mitigation potential, which is
generally greater than the market mitigation potential, can only beachieved when adequate policies are in place and barriers removed.
21
{WGIII 11.3, SPM}Sectoral estimates of economic mitigation potential and mar-
ginal costs derived from bottom-up studies corrected for double
counting of mitigation potential are shown in Figure 4.2. Whiletop-down and bottom-up studies are in line at the global level, thereare considerable differences at the sectoral level. 
{WGIII 11.3, SPM}
No single technology can provide all of the mitigation
potential in any sector. Table 4.2 lists selected examples of key tech-
nologies, policies, constraints and opportunities by sector. {WGIII SPM}
Future energy infrastructure investment decisions, expected to
total over US$20 trillion23 between 2005 and 2030, will have long-
term impacts on GHG emissions, because of the long lifetimes ofenergy plants and other infrastructure capital stock. The widespreaddiffusion of low-carbon technologies may take many decades, even
if early investments in these technologies are made attractive. Ini-
tial estimates show that returning global energy-related CO
2 emis-
sions to 2005 levels by 2030 would require a large shift in the pat-tern of investment, although the net additional investment requiredranges from negligible to 5 to 10%. 
{WGIII 4.1, 4.4, 11.6, SPM}
21The concept of ‘mitigation potential’  has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for
a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigatio n potential is further differen-
tiated in terms of ‘market mitigation potential’ and ‘economic mitigation potential’.
Market mitigation potential  is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates (reflecting the perspective of private consumers
and companies ), which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, noting t hat
barriers limit actual uptake.Economic mitigation potential
 is the mitigation potential that takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates (reflecting the
perspective of society; social discount rates are low er than those used by private investors ), assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and
measures and barriers are removed.Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies  are based on assessment of mitigation options, emphasising
specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down studies  assess the
economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about mitigati on options and capture
macro-economic and market feedbacks.
22Net negative costs (no regrets opportunities) are defined as those options whose benefits such as reduced energy costs and redu ced emissions of local/
regional pollutants equal or exceed their costs to society, excluding the benefits of avoided climate change.

Notes:
a) The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end -use allocations of
emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply secto r.
b) The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.c) Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the World Ener gy Outlook (WEO) 2004
baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces we re used to construct
a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.

from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.2.4-4.7           1.6-2.5           5.3-6.7         2.5-5.5          2.3-6.4           1.3-4.2            0.4-1.0total sectoral potential at <US$100/tCO -eq in GtCO -eq/yr:2 2Energy supply      Transport         Buildings          Industry        Agriculture         Forestry              WasteWorld total
While studies use different methodologies, there is high
agreement  and much evidence  that in all analysed world
regions near-term health co-benefits from reduced air pol-
lution, as a result of actions to reduce GHG emissions, canbe substantial and may offset a substantial fraction of miti-gation costs. 
{WGIII 11.8, SPM}
Energy efficiency and utilisation of renewable energy offer syn-
ergies with sustainable development. In least developed countries,
energy substitution can lower mortality and morbidity by reducing
indoor air pollution, reduce the workload for women and childrenand decrease the unsustainable use of fuelwood and related defor-estation. 
{WGIII 11.8, 11.9, 12.4}
Literature since the TAR confirms with high agreement  and
medium evidence  that there may be effects from Annex I
countries’ action on the global economy and global emis-
sions, although the scale of carbon leakage remains uncer-tain. 
{WGIII 11.7, SPM}
Fossil fuel exporting nations (in both Annex I and non-Annex I
countries) may expect, as indicated in the TAR, lower demand andprices and lower GDP growth due to mitigation policies. The ex-
tent of this spillover depends strongly on assumptions related to
policy decisions and oil market conditions. 
{WGIII 11.7, SPM}Critical uncertainties remain in the assessment of carbon leak-
age. Most equilibrium modelling supports the conclusion in the
TAR of economy-wide leakage from Kyoto action in the order of 5
to 20%, which would be less if competitive low-emissions tech-nologies were effectively diffused. 
{WGIII 11.7, SPM}
There is also high agreement  and medium evidence  that
changes in lifestyle and behaviour patterns can contributeto climate change mitigation across all sectors. Manage-
ment practices can also have a positive role. 
{WGIII SPM}
Examples that can have positive impacts on mitigation include
changes in consumption patterns, education and training, changesin building occupant behaviour, transport demand management andmanagement tools in industry. 
{WGIII 4.1, 5.1, 6.7, 7.3, SPM}
Policies that provide a real or implicit price of carbon could
create incentives for producers and consumers to signifi-
cantly invest in low-GHG products, technologies and pro-cesses.

gation potential in all sectors. Modelling studies show that globalcarbon prices rising to US$20-80/tCO

There is high agreement  and much evidence  that a wide
variety of national policies and instruments are available togovernments to create the incentives for mitigation action.Their applicability depends on national circumstances and
an understanding of their interactions, but experience from
implementation in various countries and sectors showsthere are advantages and disadvantages for any given in-strument.
 {WGIII 13.2, SPM}
Four main criteria are used to evaluate policies and instruments:
environmental effectiveness, cost effectiveness, distributional
effects including equity, and institutional feasibility. {WGIII 13.2, SPM}
General findings about the performance of policies are: {WGIII
13.2, SPM}
/circle6Integrating climate policies in broader development policies
makes implementation and overcoming barriers easier.
/circle6Regulations and standards  generally provide some certainty
about emission levels. They may be preferable to other instru-
ments when information or other barriers prevent producers andconsumers from responding to price signals. However, they maynot induce innovations and more advanced technologies.
/circle6Taxes and charges  can set a price for carbon, but cannot guar-
antee a particular level of emissions. Literature identifies taxes
as an efficient way of internalising costs of GHG emissions.
/circle6Tradable permits  will establish a carbon price. The volume of
allowed emissions determines their environmental effectiveness,while the allocation of permits has distributional consequences.Fluctuation in the price of carbon makes it difficult to estimate
the total cost of complying with emission permits.
/circle6Financial incentives  (subsidies and tax credits) are frequently
used by governments to stimulate the development and diffu-sion of new technologies.  While economic costs are generallyhigher than for the instruments listed above, they are often criti-cal to overcome barriers.
/circle6Voluntary agreements  between industry and governments are
politically attractive, raise awareness among stakeholders andhave played a role in the evolution of many national policies.The majority of agreements have not achieved significant emis-sions reductions beyond business as usual. However, some re-cent agreements, in a few countries, have accelerated the appli-
cation of best available technology and led to measurable emis-
sion reductions.
/circle6Information instruments  (e.g. awareness campaigns) may posi-
tively affect environmental quality by promoting informedchoices and possibly contributing to behavioural change, how-ever, their impact on emissions has not been measured yet./circle6Research, development and demonstration (RD&D)  can stimu-
late technological advances, reduce costs and enable progress
toward stabilisation.
Some corporations, local and regional authorities, NGOs and
civil groups are adopting a wide variety of voluntary actions. Thesevoluntary actions may limit GHG emissions, stimulate innovative
policies and encourage the deployment of new technologies. On
their own, they generally have limited impact on national- or re-gional-level emissions.

4.4 Relationship between adaptation and
mitigation options and relationship with
sustainable development
There is growing understanding of the possibilities to
choose and implement climate response options in severalsectors to realise synergies and avoid conflicts with other
dimensions of sustainable development. 
{WGIII SPM}
Climate change policies related to energy efficiency and renew-
able energy are often economically beneficial, improve energy se-curity and reduce local pollutant emissions. Reducing both loss ofnatural habitat and deforestation can have significant biodiversity,soil and water conservation benefits, and can be implemented in a
socially and economically sustainable manner. Forestation and
bioenergy plantations can restore degraded land, manage water run-off, retain soil carbon and benefit rural economies, but could com-pete with food production and may be negative for biodiversity, ifnot properly designed. 
{WGII 20.3, 20.8; WGIII 4.5, 9.7, 12.3, SPM}
There is growing evidence that decisions about macro-economic
policy, agricultural policy, multilateral development bank lending,insurance practices, electricity market reform, energy security andforest conservation, for example, which are often treated as beingapart from climate policy, can significantly reduce emissions (Table4.3). Similarly, non-climate policies can affect adaptive capacity
and vulnerability. 
{WGII 20.3; WGIII SPM, 12.3}
Both synergies and trade-offs exist between adaptation and
mitigation options. {WGII 18.4.3; WGIII 11.9)
Examples of synergies include properly designed biomass pro-
duction, formation of protected areas, land management, energyuse in buildings, and forestry, but synergies are rather limited in
other sectors. Potential trade-offs include increased GHG emissions
due to increased consumption of energy related to adaptive re-sponses. 
{WGII 18.4.3, 18.5, 18.7, TS.5.2; WGIII 4.5, 6.9, 8.5, 9.5, SPM}
24Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a global least-cost
approach to mitigation portfolios, with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and thu s perfect implementation of
mitigation measures throughout the 21st century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g.
land use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower baselines, use of revenues from carbon  taxes and auctioned
permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider climate benefits and generally also co -benefits of mitigation
measures, or equity issues. Significant progress has been achieved in applying approaches based on induced technological change  to stabilisation studies;
however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that consider induced technological change, projected costs for a given stabil isation level are reduced; the
reductions are greater at lower stabilisation level.Topic 4 Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the inter-relationship with sustainable development, at global and regional levels
624.5 International and regional cooperation
There is high agreement  and much evidence  that notable
achievements of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol arethe establishment of a global response to the climate changeproblem, stimulation of an array of national policies, the
creation of an international carbon market and the estab-
lishment of new institutional mechanisms that may providethe foundation for future mitigation efforts. Progress hasalso been made in addressing adaptation within the UNFCCCand additional initiatives have been suggested. 
{WGII 18.7;
WGIII 13.3, SPM}
The impact of the Protocol’s first commitment period relative
to global emissions is projected to be limited. Its economic impactson participating Annex-B countries are projected to be smaller thanpresented in the TAR, which showed 0.2 to 2% lower GDP in 2012without emissions trading and 0.1 to 1.1% lower GDP with emis-sions trading among Annex-B countries. To be more environmen-
tally effective, future mitigation efforts would need to achieve deeper
reductions covering a higher share of global emissions (see Topic5). 
{WGIII 1.4, 11.4, 13.3, SPM}The literature provides high agreement  and much evidence
of many options for achieving reductions of global GHGemissions at the international level through cooperation. Italso suggests that successful agreements are environmen-tally effective, cost-effective, incorporate distributional con-siderations and equity, and are institutionally feasible. 
{WGIII
13.3, SPM}
Greater cooperative efforts to reduce emissions will help to re-
duce global costs for achieving a given level of mitigation, or willimprove environmental effectiveness. Improving and expanding thescope of market mechanisms (such as emission trading, Joint Imple-mentation and Clean Development Mechanism) could reduce overall
mitigation costs. 
{WGIII 13.3, SPM}
Efforts to address climate change can include diverse elements
such as emissions targets; sectoral, local, sub-national and regionalactions; RD&D programmes; adopting common policies; imple-menting development-oriented actions; or expanding financing in-struments. These elements can be implemented in an integrated
fashion, but comparing the efforts made by different countries
quantitatively would be complex and resource intensive. 
{WGIII 13.3,
SPM}
Actions that could be taken by participating countries can be
differentiated both in terms of when such action is undertaken, whoparticipates and what the action will be. Actions can be binding or
non-binding, include fixed or dynamic targets, and participation
can be static or vary over time.

645.1 Risk management perspective
Responding to climate change involves an iterative risk
management process that includes both mitigation and ad-aptation, taking into account actual and avoided climatechange damages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity and at-titudes to risk. 
{WGII 20. 9, SPM; WGIII SPM}
Risk management techniques can explicitly accommodate sectoral,
regional and temporal diversity, but their application requires informa-
tion about not only impacts resulting from the most likely climate sce-narios, but also impacts arising from lower-probability but higher-con-sequence events and the consequences of proposed policies and mea-sures. Risk is generally understood to be the product of the likelihoodof an event and its consequences. Climate change impacts depend on
the characteristics of natural and human systems, their development
pathways and their specific locations.

5.2 Key vulnerabilities, impacts and risks –
long-term perspectives
The five ‘reasons for concern’ identified in the TAR are now
assessed to be stronger with many risks identified withhigher confidence. Some are projected to be larger or tooccur at lower increases in temperature. This is due to (1)better understanding of the magnitude of impacts and risks
associated with increases in global average temperature and
GHG concentrations, including vulnerability to present-dayclimate variability, (2) more precise identification of the cir-cumstances that make systems, sectors, groups and regionsespecially vulnerable and (3) growing evidence that the riskof very large impacts on multiple century time scales would
continue to increase as long as GHG concentrations and
temperature continue to increase. Understanding about therelationship between impacts (the basis for ‘reasons for con-cern’ in the TAR) and vulnerability (that includes the ability
to adapt to impacts) has improved. 
{WGII 4.4, 5.4, 19.ES, 19.3.7,
TS.4.6; WGIII 3.5, SPM}
The TAR concluded that vulnerability to climate change is a func-
tion of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Adaptation can re-duce sensitivity to climate change while mitigation can  reduce theexposure to climate change, including its rate and extent. Both conclu-sions are confirmed in this assessment. 
{WGII 20.2, 20.7.3}
No single metric can adequately describe the diversity of key
vulnerabilities or support their ranking. A sample of relevant im-pacts is provided in Figure 3.6. The estimation of key vulnerabili-ties in any system, and damage implied, will depend on exposure(the rate and magnitude of climate change), sensitivity, which isdetermined in part and where relevant by development status, and
adaptive capacity. Some key vulnerabilities may be linked to thresh-
olds; in some cases these may cause a system to shift from one stateto another, whereas others have thresholds that are defined subjec-tively and thus depend on societal values. 
{WGII 19.ES, 19.1}
The five ‘reasons for concern’ that were identified in the TAR
were intended to synthesise information on climate risks and key
vulnerabilities and to “aid readers in making their own determina-
tion” about risk. These remain a viable framework to consider keyvulnerabilities, and they have been updated in the AR4. 
{TAR WGII
Chapter 19; WGII SPM}
/circle6Risks to unique and threatened systems.   There is new and
stronger evidence of observed impacts of climate change on
unique and vulnerable systems (such as polar and high moun-
tain communities and ecosystems), with increasing levels ofadverse impacts as temperatures increase further. An increas-ing risk of species extinction and coral reef damage is projectedwith higher confidence than in the TAR as warming proceeds.There is medium confidence  that approximately 20 to 30% of
plant and animal species assessed so far are likely  to be at in-
creased risk of extinction if increases in global average tem-perature exceed 1.5 to 2.5°C over 1980-1999 levels. Confidencehas increased that a 1 to 2°C increase in global mean tempera-ture above 1990 levels (about 1.5 to 2.5°C above pre-indus-
25Key Vulnerabilities can be identified based on a number of criteria in the literature, including magnitude, timing, persistence /reversibility, the
potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likelihood and ‘importance’ of the impacts.Key Vulnerabilities and Article 2 of the UNFCCC
Article 2 of the UNFCCC states:
“The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to
achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the at mo-
sphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achie ved
within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened
and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”
Determining what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” in relation to Article 2 of the UNF CCC
involves value judgements. Science can support informed decisions on this issue, including by providing criteria for judging wh ich
vulnerabilities might be labelled ‘key’. {SYR 3.3, WGII 19.ES}
Key vulnerabilities25 may be associated with many climate-sensitive systems, including food supply, infrastructure, health, water
resources, coastal systems, ecosystems, global biogeochemical cycles, ice sheets and modes of oceanic and atmospheric circulati on.

More specific information is now available across the regions of the world concerning the nature of future impacts, including f or some
places not covered in previous assessments. {WGII SPM}65Topic 5 The long-term perspective
trial) poses significant risks to many unique and threatened sys-
tems including many biodiversity hotspots. Corals are vulner-
able to thermal stress and have low adaptive capacity. Increases
in sea surface temperature of about 1 to 3°C are projected toresult in more frequent coral bleaching events and widespreadmortality, unless there is thermal adaptation or acclimatisationby corals. Increasing vulnerability of Arctic indigenous com-munities and small island communities to warming is projected.
{SYR 3.3, 3.4, Figure 3.6, Table 3.2; WGII 4.ES, 4.4, 6.4, 14.4.6, 15.ES,
15.4, 15.6, 16.ES, 16.2.1, 16.4, Table 19.1, 19.3.7, TS.5.3, Figure TS.12,Figure TS.14}
/circle6Risks of extreme weather events.   Responses to some recent
extreme climate events reveal higher levels of vulnerability inboth developing and developed countries than was assessed in
the TAR. There is now higher confidence in the projected in-
creases in droughts, heat waves and floods, as well as their ad-verse impacts. As summarised in Table 3.2, increases in drought,heat waves and floods are projected in many regions and wouldhave mostly adverse impacts, including increased water stressand wild fire frequency, adverse effects on food production,
adverse health effects, increased flood risk and extreme high
sea level, and damage to infrastructure. 
{SYR 3.2, 3.3, Table 3.2;

/circle6Distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities.  There are sharp
differences across regions and those in the weakest economic
position are often the most vulnerable to climate change and
are frequently the most susceptible to climate-related damages,especially when they face multiple stresses. There is increasingevidence of greater vulnerability of specific groups such as thepoor and elderly not only in developing but also in developedcountries. There is greater confidence in the projected regional
patterns of climate change (see Topic 3.2) and in the projec-
tions of regional impacts, enabling better identification of par-ticularly vulnerable systems, sectors and regions (see Topic 3.3).Moreover, there is increased evidence that low-latitude and less-developed areas generally face greater risk, for example in dryareas and megadeltas. New studies confirm that Africa is one
of the most vulnerable continents because of the range of pro-
jected impacts, multiple stresses and low adaptive capacity.Substantial risks due to sea level rise are projected particularlyfor Asian megadeltas and for small island communities.

/circle6Aggregate impacts.   Compared to the TAR, initial net market-
based benefits from climate change are projected to peak at alower magnitude and therefore sooner than was assessed in theTAR. It is likely  that there will be higher damages for larger
magnitudes of global temperature increase than estimated in
the TAR, and the net costs of impacts of increased warming are
projected to increase over time. Aggregate impacts have alsobeen quantified in other metrics (see Topic 3.3): for example,climate change over the next century is likely  to adversely af-
fect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal
flooding, reductions in water supplies, increased malnutrition
and increased health impacts. 
{SYR 3.3, Figure 3.6; WGII 19.3.7,

/circle6Risks of large-scale singularities.26  As discussed in Topic 3.4,
during the current century, a large-scale abrupt change in themeridional overturning circulation is very unlikely . There is high
confidence  that global warming over many centuries would lead
to a sea level rise contribution from thermal expansion alonethat is projected to be much larger than observed over the 20
th
century, with loss of coastal area and associated impacts. Thereis better understanding than in the TAR that the risk of addi-tional contributions to sea level rise from both the Greenland
and possibly Antarctic ice sheets may be larger than projected
by ice sheet models and could occur on century time scales.This is because ice dynamical processes seen in recent obser-vations but not fully included in ice sheet models assessed inthe AR4 could increase the rate of ice loss. Completedeglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet would raise sea level
by 7m and could be irreversible. 
{SYR 3.4; WGI 10.3, Box 10.1;
WGII 19.3.7, SPM}
5.3 Adaptation and mitigation
There is high confidence  that neither adaptation nor mitiga-
tion alone can avoid all climate change impacts. Adaptation
is necessary both in the short term and longer term to ad-
dress impacts resulting from the warming that would occureven for the lowest stabilisation scenarios assessed. Thereare barriers, limits and costs that are not fully understood.Adaptation and mitigation can complement each other andtogether can significantly reduce the risks of climate change .
{WGII 4.ES, TS 5.1, 18.4, 18.6, 20.7, SPM; WGIII 1.2, 2.5, 3.5, 3.6}
Adaptation will be ineffective for some cases such as natural
ecosystems (e.g. loss of Arctic sea ice and marine ecosystem vi-ability), the disappearance of mountain glaciers that play vital rolesin water storage and supply, or adaptation to sea level rise of sev-eral metres
27. It will be less feasible or very costly in many cases for
the projected climate change beyond the next several decades (such
as deltaic regions and estuaries). There is high confidence  that the
ability of many ecosystems to adapt naturally will be exceeded thiscentury. In addition, multiple barriers and constraints to effectiveadaptation exist in human systems (see Topic 4.2). 
{SYR 4.2; WGII
17.4.2, 19.2, 19.4.1}
Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely
to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems toadapt. Reliance on adaptation alone could eventually lead to a mag-nitude of climate change to which effective adaptation is not pos-sible, or will only be available at very high social, environmentaland economic costs. 
{WGII 18.1, SPM}
26See glossary
27While it is technically possible to adapt to several metres of sea le vel rise, the resources required are so unevenly distribut ed that in reality this risk is
outside the scope of adaptation. {WGII 17.4.2, 19.4.1}Topic 5 The long-term perspective
6628Peaking means that the emissions need to reach a maximum before they decline later.
29For the lowest mitigation scenario category assessed, emissions would need to peak by 2015 and for the highest by 2090 (see Tab le 5.1). Scenarios that
use alternative emission pathways show substantial differences on the rate of global climate change. {WGII 19.4}Efforts to mitigate GHG emissions to reduce the rate and
magnitude of climate change need to account for inertia inthe climate and socio-economic systems. 
{SYR 3.2; WGI 10.3,
10.4, 10.7, SPM; WGIII 2.3.4}
After GHG concentrations are stabilised, the rate at which the
global average temperature increases is expected to slow within afew decades. Small increases in global average temperature couldstill be expected for several centuries. Sea level rise from thermalexpansion would continue for many centuries at a rate that eventu-ally decreases from that reached before stabilisation, due to ongo-
ing heat uptake by oceans. 
{SYR 3.2, WGI 10.3, 10.4, 10.7, SPM}
Delayed emission reductions significantly constrain the oppor-
tunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and increase the riskof more severe climate change impacts. Even though benefits ofmitigation measures in terms of avoided climate change would takeseveral decades to materialise, mitigation actions begun in the short
term would avoid locking in both long-lived carbon intensive in-
frastructure and development pathways, reduce the rate of climatechange and reduce the adaptation needs associated with higher lev-els of warming. 
{WGII 18.4, 20.6, 20.7, SPM; WGIII 2.3.4, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6,
SPM}5.4 Emission trajectories for stabilisation
In order to stabilise the concentration of GHGs in the atmo-
sphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereaf-ter.
28 The lower the stabilisation level, the more quickly this
peak and decline would need to occur (Figure 5.1).29 {WGIII
3.3, 3.5, SPM}
Advances in modelling since the TAR permit the assessment of
multi-gas mitigation strategies for exploring the attainability andcosts for achieving stabilisation of GHG concentrations. Thesescenarios explore a wider range of future scenarios, includinglower levels of stabilisation, than reported in the TAR. 
{WGIII 3.3,
3.5, SPM}
Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will
have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lowerstabilisation levels (Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1). 
{WGIII 3.5,
SPM}
Table 5.1 summarises the required emission levels for different
groups of stabilisation concentrations and the resulting equilibrium
CO2 emissions and equilibrium temperature increases for a range of stabilisation levels

the corresponding relationship between the stabilisation target and the likely  equilibrium global average temperature increase above pre-industrial (right-
hand panel). Approaching equilibrium can take several centuries, especially for scenarios with higher levels of stabilisation. Coloured shadings show
stabilisation scenarios grouped according to different targets (stabilisation category I to VI). The right-hand panel shows ran ges of global average tempera-
ture change above pre-industrial, using (i) ‘best estimate’ climate sensitivity of 3°C (black line in middle of shaded area), ( ii) upper bound of likely  range of
climate sensitivity of 4.5°C (red line at top of shaded area) (iii) lower bound of likely  range of climate sensitivity of 2°C (blue line at bottom of shaded area).
Black dashed lines in the left panel give the emissions range of recent baseline scenarios published since the SRES (2000). Emi ssions ranges of the
stabilisation scenarios comprise CO2-only and multigas scenarios and correspond to the 10th to 90th percentile of the full scenario distribution. Note: CO2
emissions in most models do not include emissions from decay of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestati on, and from peat fires
and drained peat soils. {WGIII Figures SPM.7 and SPM.8}

Notes:
a) The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be un derestimated due to
missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3).
b) Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO2-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived GHGs is about
455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO2-eq.
c) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios can be
compared with CO2-only scenarios (see Figure 2.1).
d) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C.
e) Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stab ilisation of GHG
concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentra tions occurs
between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 30).
f) Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at le ast many centuries.
These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs based on th e best
estimate of 3°C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps. Long-term  thermal expansion
is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial. (AOGCM refers to Atmos phere-Ocean
General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)
global average temperature increases, using the ‘best estimate’ of
climate sensitivity (see Figure 5.1 for the likely  range of uncer-
tainty). Stabilisation at lower concentration and related equilibriumtemperature levels advances the date when emissions need to peakand requires greater emissions reductions by 2050.
30 Climate sen-
sitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation scenarios that aim to meet
specific temperature levels. The timing and level of mitigation toreach a given temperature stabilisation level is earlier and morestringent if climate sensitivity is high than if it is low. 
{WGIII 3.3,
3.4, 3.5, 3.6, SPM}
Sea level rise under warming is inevitable. Thermal expansion
would continue for many centuries after GHG concentrations have
stabilised, for any of the stabilisation levels assessed, causing aneventual sea level rise much larger than projected for the 21
st cen-
tury (Table 5.1). If GHG and aerosol concentrations had beenstabilised at year 2000 levels, thermal expansion alone would beexpected to lead to further sea level rise of 0.3 to 0.8m. The even-
tual contributions from Greenland ice sheet loss could be several
metres, and larger than from thermal expansion, should warming inexcess of 1.9 to 4.6°C above pre-industrial be sustained over manycenturies. These long-term consequences would have major impli-cations for world coastlines. The long time scale of thermal expan-
sion and ice sheet response to warming imply that mitigation strat-
egies that seek to stabilise GHG concentrations (or radiative forc-ing) at or above present levels do not stabilise sea level for manycenturies. 
{WG1 10.7}
Feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate change affect
the required mitigation and adaptation response to climate change.
Climate-carbon cycle coupling is expected to increase the fraction
of anthropogenic emissions that remains in the atmosphere as theclimate system warms (see Topics 2.3 and 3.2.1), but mitigationstudies have not yet incorporated the full range of these feedbacks.As a consequence, the emission reductions to meet a particularstabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed in Table
5.1 might be underestimated. Based on current understanding of
climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, model studies suggest thatstabilising CO
2 concentrations at, for example, 450ppm31 could re-
quire cumulative emissions over the 21st century to be less than
1800 [1370 to 2200] GtCO2, which is about 27% less than the 2460
[2310 to 2600] GtCO2 determined without consideration of carbon
cycle feedbacks. {SYR 2.3, 3.2.1; WGI 7.3, 10.4, SPM}
30Estimates for the evolution of temperature over the course of this century are not available in the AR4 for the stabilisation s cenarios. For most stabilisation
levels global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level ov er a few centuries. For the much lower stabilisation s cenarios (category I and II,
Figure 5.1), the equilibrium temperature may be reached earlier.
31To stabilise at 1000ppm CO2, this feedback could require that cumulative emissions be reduced from a model average of approximately 5190 [4910 to
5460] GtCO2 to approximately 4030 [3590 to 4580] GtCO2.  {WGI 7.3, 10.4, SPM}CO2

figure shows illustrative scenarios from four models (AIM, IMA GE, IPAC and MESSAGE) aiming at the stabilisation at low (490 to 540ppm CO2-eq) and
intermediate levels (650ppm CO2-eq) respectively. Dark bars denote reductions for a target of 650ppm CO2-eq and light bars denote the additional reduc-
tions to achieve 490 to 540ppm CO2-eq. Note that some models do not consider mitigation through forest sink enhancement (AIM and IPAC) or CCS (AIM)
and that the share of low-carbon energy options in total energy supply is also determined by inclusion of these options in the baseline. CCS includes CO2
capture and storage from biomass. Forest sinks include reducing emissions from deforestation. The figure shows emissions reduct ions from baseline
scenarios with cumulative emissions between 6000 to 7000 GtCO2-eq (2000-2100). {WGIII Figure SPM.9}
5.5 Technology flows and development
There is high agreement and much evidence  that all
stabilisation levels assessed can be achieved by deploy-ment of a portfolio of technologies that are either currentlyavailable or expected to be commercialised in coming de-cades, assuming appropriate and effective incentives arein place for development, acquisition, deployment and dif-
fusion of technologies and addressing related barriers. 
{WGIII
SPM}
Worldwide deployment of low-GHG emission technologies as
well as technology improvements through public and private RD&Dwould be required for achieving stabilisation targets as well as costreduction.
32 Figure 5.2 gives illustrative examples of the contribu-
tion of the portfolio of mitigation options. The contribution of dif-
ferent technologies varies over time and region and depends on thebaseline development path, available technologies and relative costs,and the analysed stabilisation levels. Stabilisation at the lower ofthe assessed levels (490 to 540ppm CO
2-eq) requires early invest-
ments and substantially more rapid diffusion and commercialisation
of advanced low-emissions technologies over the next decades(2000-2030) and higher contributions across abatement options in
the long term (2000-2100). This requires that barriers to develop-
ment, acquisition, deployment and diffusion of technologies are
effectively addressed with appropriate incentives. {WGIII 2.7, 3.3,
3.4, 3.6, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, SPM}
Without sustained investment flows and effective technology
transfer, it may be difficult to achieve emission reduction at a sig-nificant scale. Mobilising financing of incremental costs of low-
carbon technologies is important. 
{WGIII 13.3, SPM}
There are large uncertainties concerning the future contribu-
tion of different technologies. However, all assessed stabilisationscenarios concur that 60 to 80% of the reductions over the courseof the century would come from energy supply and use and indus-trial processes. Including non-CO
2 and CO2 land-use and forestry
mitigation options provides greater flexibility and cost-effective-
ness. Energy efficiency plays a key role across many scenarios formost regions and time scales. For lower stabilisation levels, sce-narios put more emphasis on the use of low-carbon energy sources,such as renewable energy, nuclear power and the use of CO
2 cap-
ture and storage (CCS). In these scenarios, improvements of car-
bon intensity of energy supply and the whole economy needs to be
much faster than in the past (Figure 5.2). {WGIII 3.3, 3.4, TS.3, SPM}
32By comparison, government funding in real absolute terms for most energy research programmes has been flat or declining for nea rly two decades (even
after the UNFCCC came into force) and is now about half of the 1980 level. {WGIII 2.7, 3.4, 4.5, 11.5, 13.2}69Topic 5 The long-term perspective
5.6 Costs of mitigation and long-term
stabilisation targets
The macro-economic costs of mitigation generally rise with
the stringency of the stabilisation target and are relativelyhigher when derived from baseline scenarios characterisedby high emission levels. 
{WGIII SPM}
There is high agreement  and medium evidence that in 2050 glo-
bal average macro-economic costs for multi-gas mitigation towardsstabilisation between 710 and 445ppm CO
2-eq are between a 1%
gain to a 5.5% decrease of global GDP (Table 5.2). This corre-sponds to slowing average annual global GDP growth by less than0.12 percentage points. Estimated GDP losses by 2030 are on aver-
age lower and show a smaller spread compared to 2050 (Table 5.2).
For specific countries and sectors, costs vary considerably from theglobal average.
33 {WGIII 3.3, 13.3, SPM}
5.7 Costs, benefits and avoided climate
impacts at global and regional levels
Impacts of climate change will vary regionally. Aggregated
and discounted to the present, they are very likely  to im-
pose net annual costs, which will increase over time as glo-bal temperatures increase. 
{WGII SPM}
For increases in global average temperature of less than 1 to 3°C
above 1980-1999 levels, some impacts are projected to produce
market benefits in some places and sectors while, at the same time,imposing costs in other places and sectors. Global mean losses couldbe 1 to 5% of GDP for 4°C of warming, but regional losses couldbe substantially higher. 
{WGII 9.ES, 10.6, 15.ES, 20.6, SPM}
Peer-reviewed estimates of the social cost of carbon (net eco-
nomic costs of damages from climate change aggregated across theglobe and discounted to the present) for 2005 have an average value
of US$12 per tonne of CO2, but the range from 100 estimates is
large (-$3 to $95/tCO2). The range of published evidence indicates
that the net damage costs of climate change are projected to besignificant and to increase over time. 
{WGII 20.6, SPM}
It is very likely  that globally aggregated figures underestimate
the damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifi-able impacts. It is virtually certain  that aggregate estimates of costs
mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions, coun-
tries and populations. In some locations and amongst some groupsof people with high exposure, high sensitivity and/or low adaptivecapacity, net costs will be significantly larger than the global aver-age. 
{WGII 7.4, 20.ES, 20.6, 20.ES, SPM}
Limited and early analytical results from integrated analy-
ses of the global costs and benefits of mitigation indicate
that these are broadly comparable in magnitude, but do notas yet permit an unambiguous determination of an emis-sions pathway or stabilisation level where benefits exceedcosts. 
{WGIII SPM}
Comparing the costs of mitigation with avoided damages would
require the reconciliation of welfare impacts on people living in
different places and at different points in time into a global aggre-gate measure of well-being. 
{WGII 18.ES}
Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve
balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductionsnow against the corresponding medium-term and long-term climate
risks of delay. 
{WGIII SPM}
Many impacts can be avoided, reduced or delayed by miti-
gation. {WGII SPM}
Although the small number of impact assessments that evalu-
ate stabilisation scenarios do not take full account of uncertaintiesin projected climate under stabilisation, they nevertheless provide
indications of damages avoided and risks reduced for different

70amounts of emissions reduction. The rate and magnitude of future
human-induced climate change and its associated impacts are de-
termined by human choices defining alternative socio-economic
futures and mitigation actions that influence emission pathways.Figure 3.2 demonstrates that alternative SRES emission pathwayscould lead to substantial differences in climate change throughoutthe 21
st century. Some of the impacts at the high temperature end of
Figure 3.6 could be avoided by socio-economic development path-
ways that limit emissions and associated climate change towards
the lower end of the ranges illustrated in Figure 3.6. {SYR 3.2, 3.3;
WGIII 3.5, 3.6, SPM}
Figure 3.6 illustrates how reduced warming could reduce the
risk of, for example, affecting a significant number of ecosystems,the risk of extinctions, and the likelihood that cereal productivity
in some regions would tend to fall. 
{SYR 3.3, Figure 3.6; WGII 4.4, 5.4,
Table 20.6}
5.8 Broader environmental and
sustainability issues
Sustainable development can reduce vulnerability to climate
change, and climate change could impede nations’ abilitiesto achieve sustainable development pathways. 
{WGII SPM}
It is very likely  that climate change can slow the pace of progress
toward sustainable development either directly through increasedexposure to adverse impacts or indirectly through erosion of the
capacity to adapt. Over the next half-century, climate change could
impede achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. {WGII
SPM}
Climate change will interact at all scales with other trends in
global environmental and natural resource concerns, includingwater, soil and air pollution, health hazards, disaster risk, and de-forestation. Their combined impacts may be compounded in future
in the absence of integrated mitigation and adaptation measures.
{WGII 20.3, 20.7, 20.8, SPM}
Making development more sustainable can enhance miti-
gative and adaptive capacities, reduce emissions, and re-duce vulnerability, but there may be barriers to implementa-tion. 
{WGII 20.8; WGIII 12.2, SPM}
Both adaptive and mitigative capacities can be enhanced through
sustainable development. Sustainable development can, thereby,reduce vulnerability to climate change by reducing sensitivities(through adaptation) and/or exposure (through mitigation). Atpresent, however, few plans for promoting sustainability have ex-plicitly included either adapting to climate change impacts, or pro-
moting adaptive capacity. Similarly, changing development paths
can make a major contribution to mitigation but may require re-sources to overcome multiple barriers.

Robust findings, key uncertaintiesTopic 6 Robust findings, key uncertainties
72Robust findings, key uncertainties
As in the TAR, a robust finding for climate change is defined
as one that holds under a variety of approaches, methods, modelsand assumptions, and is expected to be relatively unaffected byuncertainties. Key uncertainties are those that, if reduced, couldlead to new robust findings. 
{TAR SYR Q.9}
Robust findings do not encompass all key findings of the AR4.
Some key findings may be policy-relevant even though they areassociated with large uncertainties. 
{WGII 20.9}
The robust findings and key uncertainties listed below do not
represent an exhaustive list.
6.1 Observed changes in climate and their
effects, and their causes
Robust findings
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evi-
dent from observations of increases in global average air and oceantemperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising glo-bal average sea level. 
{WGI 3.9, SPM}
Many natural systems, on all continents and in some oceans,
are being affected by regional climate changes. Observed changes
in many physical and biological systems are consistent with warm-ing. As a result of the uptake of anthropogenic CO
2 since 1750, the
acidity of the surface ocean has increased. {WGI 5.4 , WGII 1.3}
Global total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions, weighted
by their 100-year GWPs, have grown by 70% between 1970 and
2004. As a result of anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric concen-trations of N
2O now far exceed pre-industrial values spanning many
thousands of years, and those of CH4 and CO2 now far exceed the
natural range over the last 650,000 years. {WGI SPM; WGIII 1.3}
Most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is
very likely  due to anthropogenic GHG increases and it is likely  that
there is a discernible human-induced warming averaged over eachcontinent (except Antarctica). 
{WGI 9.4, SPM}
Anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has likely
had a discernible influence at the global scale on observed changesin many physical and biological systems. 
{WGII 1.4, SPM}
Key uncertainties
Climate data coverage remains limited in some regions and there
is a notable lack of geographic balance in data and literature on
observed changes in natural and managed systems, with marked
scarcity in developing countries. {WGI SPM; WGII 1.3, SPM}
Analysing and monitoring changes in extreme events, includ-
ing drought, tropical cyclones, extreme temperatures and the fre-quency and intensity of precipitation, is more difficult than for cli-matic averages as longer data time-series of higher spatial and tem-
poral resolutions are required. 
{WGI 3.8, SPM}
Effects of climate changes on human and some natural systems
are difficult to detect due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers.
{WGII 1.3}Difficulties remain in reliably simulating and attributing ob-
served temperature changes to natural or human causes at smaller
than continental scales. At these smaller scales, factors such as land-use change and pollution also complicate the detection of anthro-pogenic warming influence on physical and biological systems. 
{WGI
8.3, 9.4, SPM; WGII 1.4, SPM}
The magnitude of CO2 emissions from land-use change and
CH4 emissions from individual sources remain as key uncertain-
ties. {WGI 2.3, 7.3, 7.4; WGIII 1.3, TS.14}
6.2 Drivers and projections of future climate
changes and their impacts
Robust findings
With current climate change mitigation policies and related sus-
tainable development practices, global GHG emissions will con-
tinue to grow over the next few decades. {WGIII 3.2, SPM}
For the next two decades a warming of about 0.2°C per decade
is projected for a range of SRES emissions scenarios. {WGI 10.3,
10.7, SPM}
Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates would cause
further warming and induce many changes in the global climate
system during the 21st century that would very likely  be larger than
those observed during the 20th century. {WGI 10.3, 11.1, SPM}
The pattern of future warming where land warms more than the
adjacent oceans and more in northern high latitudes is seen in allscenarios. 
{WGI 10.3, 11.1, SPM}
Warming tends to reduce terrestrial ecosystem and ocean up-
take of atmospheric CO2, increasing the fraction of anthropogenic
emissions that remains in the atmosphere. {WGI 7.3, 10.4, 10.5, SPM}
Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for
centuries even if GHG emissions were to be reduced sufficientlyfor GHG concentrations to stabilise, due to the time scales associ-
ated with climate processes and feedbacks. 
{WGI 10.7, SPM}
Equilibrium climate sensitivity is very unlikely  to be less than
1.5°C. {WGI 8.6, 9.6, Box 10.2, SPM}
Some systems, sectors and regions are likely  to be especially
affected by climate change. The systems and sectors are some eco-systems (tundra, boreal forest, mountain, mediterranean-type, man-
groves, salt marshes, coral reefs and the sea-ice biome), low-lying
coasts, water resources in some dry regions at mid-latitudes and inthe dry topics and in areas dependent on snow and ice melt, agri-culture in low-latitude regions, and human health in areas with lowadaptive capacity. The regions are the Arctic, Africa, small islandsand Asian and African megadeltas. Within other regions, even those
with high incomes, some people, areas and activities can be par-
ticularly at risk. 
{WGII TS.4.5}
Impacts are very likely  to increase due to increased frequencies
and intensities of some extreme weather events. Recent events havedemonstrated the vulnerability of some sectors and regions, includ-ing in developed countries, to heat waves, tropical cyclones, floods
and drought, providing stronger reasons for concern as compared
to the findings of the TAR. 
{WGII Table SPM.2, 19.3}73Topic 6 Robust findings, key uncertainties
Key uncertainties
Uncertainty in the equilibrium climate sensitivity creates un-
certainty in the expected warming for a given CO2-eq stabilisation
scenario. Uncertainty in the carbon cycle feedback creates uncer-
tainty in the emissions trajectory required to achieve a particular
stabilisation level. {WGI 7.3, 10.4, 10.5, SPM}
Models differ considerably in their estimates of the strength of
different feedbacks in the climate system, particularly cloud feed-backs, oceanic heat uptake and carbon cycle feedbacks, althoughprogress has been made in these areas. Also, the confidence in pro-
jections is higher for some variables (e.g. temperature) than for
others (e.g. precipitation), and it is higher for larger spatial scalesand longer time averaging periods. 
{WGI 7.3, 8.1-8.7, 9.6, 10.2, 10.7,
SPM; WGII 4.4}
Aerosol impacts on the magnitude of the temperature response,
on clouds and on precipitation remain uncertain. {WGI 2.9, 7.5, 9.2,
9.4, 9.5}
Future changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass,
particularly due to changes in ice flow, are a major source of uncer-tainty that could increase sea level rise projections. The uncertaintyin the penetration of the heat into the oceans also contributes to thefuture sea level rise uncertainty. 
{WGI 4.6, 6.4, 10.3, 10.7, SPM}
Large-scale ocean circulation changes beyond the 21st century
cannot be reliably assessed because of uncertainties in the meltwa-ter supply from the Greenland ice sheet and model response to thewarming. 
{WGI 6.4, 8.7, 10.3 }
Projections of climate change and its impacts beyond about 2050
are strongly scenario- and model-dependent, and improved projections
would require improved understanding of sources of uncertainty andenhancements in systematic observation networks. 
{WGII TS.6}
Impacts research is hampered by uncertainties surrounding re-
gional projections of climate change, particularly precipitation.
{WGII TS.6}
Understanding of low-probability/high-impact events and the
cumulative impacts of sequences of smaller events, which is re-quired for risk-based approaches to decision-making, is generallylimited. 
{WGII 19.4, 20.2, 20.4, 20.9, TS.6}
6.3 Responses to climate change
Robust findings
Some planned adaptation (of human activities) is occurring now;
more extensive adaptation is required to reduce vulnerability to cli-
mate change. {WGII 17.ES, 20.5, Table 20.6, SPM}
Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely
to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems toadapt. 
{WGII 20.7, SPM}A wide range of mitigation options is currently available or pro-
jected to be available by 2030 in all sectors. The economic mitiga-
tion potential, at costs that range from net negative up to US$100/tCO
2-equivalent, is sufficient to offset the projected growth of glo-
bal emissions or to reduce emissions to below current levels in 2030.
{WGIII 11.3, SPM}
Many impacts can be reduced, delayed or avoided by mitiga-
tion. Mitigation efforts and investments over the next two to three
decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lowerstabilisation levels. Delayed emissions reductions significantly con-strain the opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels andincrease the risk of more severe climate change impacts. 
{WGII SPM,
WGIII SPM}
The range of stabilisation levels for GHG concentrations that
have been assessed can be achieved by deployment of a portfolioof technologies that are currently available and those that are ex-pected to be commercialised in coming decades, provided that ap-propriate and effective incentives are in place and barriers are re-moved.  In addition, further RD&D would be required to improve
the technical performance, reduce the costs and achieve social ac-
ceptability of new technologies. The lower the stabilisation levels,the greater the need for investment in new technologies during thenext few decades. 
{WGIII 3.3, 3.4}
Making development more sustainable by changing develop-
ment paths can make a major contribution to climate change miti-
gation and adaptation and to reducing vulnerability. {WGII 18.7, 20.3,
SPM; WGIII 13.2, SPM}
Decisions about macro-economic and other policies that seem
unrelated to climate change can significantly affect emissions. {WGIII
12.2}
Key uncertainties
Understanding of how development planners incorporate in-
formation about climate variability and change into their decisions
is limited.  This limits the integrated assessment of vulnerability.
{WGII 18.8, 20.9}
The evolution and utilisation of adaptive and mitigative capac-
ity depend on underlying socio-economic development pathways.
{WGII 17.3, 17.4, 18.6, 19.4, 20.9}
Barriers, limits and costs of adaptation are not fully understood,
partly because effective adaptation measures are highly dependent
on specific geographical and climate risk factors as well as institu-tional, political and financial constraints. 
{WGII SPM}
Estimates of mitigation costs and potentials depend on assump-
tions about future socio-economic growth, technological changeand consumption patterns. Uncertainty arises in particular from
assumptions regarding the drivers of technology diffusion and the
potential of long-term technology performance and cost improve-ments. Also little is known about the effects of  changes in behaviour
and lifestyles. 
{WGIII 3.3, 3.4, 11.3}
The effects of non-climate policies on emissions are poorly
quantified. {WGIII 12.2}
