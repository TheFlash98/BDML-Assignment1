Abstract
With climate change predicted to increase the likelihood of landslide events, there
is a growing need for rapid landslide detection technologies that help inform
emergency responses. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a remote sensing tech-
nique that can provide measurements of affected areas independent of weather or
lighting conditions. Usage of SAR, however, is hindered by domain knowledge
that is necessary for the pre-processing steps and its interpretation requires ex-
pert knowledge. We provide simpliﬁed, pre-processed, machine-learning ready
SAR datacubes for four globally located landslide events obtained from several
Sentinel-1 satellite passes before and after a landslide triggering event together
with segmentation maps of the landslides. From this dataset, using the Hokkaido,
Japan datacube, we study the feasibility of SAR-based landslide detection with
supervised deep learning (DL). Our results demonstrate that DL models can be used
to detect landslides from SAR data, achieving an Area under the Precision-Recall
curve exceeding 0.7. We ﬁnd that additional satellite visits enhance detection
performance, but that early detection is possible when SAR data is combined
with terrain information from a digital elevation model. This can be especially
useful for time-critical emergency interventions. Code is made publicly available

1 Introduction
According to the United Nations Ofﬁce for Disaster Risk Reduction, landslides have affected 4.8
million people and caused 18,414 deaths between 1998-2017 [ 1]. Rising temperatures and climate
Authors contributed equally.
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.arXiv:2211.02869v1  [eess.SP]  5 Nov 2022change are projected to worsen this situation [ 2,3] with the increase of sustained droughts and intense
rainfall events [ 4,5,6]. Given these predictions, there is a growing need for timely and accurate
landslide assessment methods that can inform decision makers and emergency responders. In the
aftermath of a landslide, optical satellite imagery is commonly used to map the extent of the event.
The fact that optical data is is often hindered by clouds and limited to day time observations, motivates
the study of weather independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as a monitoring technique.
DL algorithms for computer vision can be used for SAR analysis if SAR data is represented as images
(or georeferenced data arrays) [ 7]. This has been exploited for multiple use cases such as the detection
of volcanic activity [ 8], ﬂoods [ 9], and landslides[ 10]. The landslide change detection with DL can
be performed in two ways: object-level [ 11] and pixel-level detection [ 10]. As per the authors’ best
knowledge [ 10,11] are one of the ﬁrst studies in landslide mapping using DL and SAR images where
bi- and tri-temporal images have been used. Usage of multi-temporal SAR polarization modes has
been demonstrated with traditional approaches, such as thresholding [ 12], similar conclusion was
reported in a DL study [ 13]. To achieve good accuracy, these methods require longer time series of
SAR data (up to months after the event), which are unavailable in an emergency scenario.
The development of DL algorithms for SAR analysis, however, is still hindered by its complex
characteristics and pre-procesisng requirements. To help overcome this barrier, we publicly release
curated DL-ready datasets [ 14] that includes SAR intensity and interferometry data before and after
disaster events that triggered landslides. Using part of this dataset, we further develop a supervised
DL algorithm for landslide detection and demonstrate the feasibility of rapid detection using only
one satellite pass, if SAR data is combined with terrain information.
2 Data
We produce analysis-ready datacubes [ 14] with multiple layers of SAR time-series data and auxiliary
geographic information for multiple landslide events. To this end, we develop a data pipeline that
processes SAR intensity and interferometric products from multiple sources and compile them
together with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and DEM-derived products into a format that can be
fed into DL models (see Fig. 1).

Radar intensity images (VV and VH) from before and after the landslide trigger event; 4-8: Digital

In this study, we focus our machine learning experiments on the datacube created for earthquake-
triggered landslides over Hokkaid ¯o, Japan in 2017 (Fig 2). Additional datacubes are available for
landslide events over Mt Talakmau, Indonesia (2022 earthquake), Kaik ¯oura, New Zealand (2016
earthquake) and Puerto Rico (2017 Hurricane) (see Appendix A for more details on datacube creation).
3 Methodology
3.1 Experimental setup
The machine learning pipeline is set up to solve a segmentation task (Fig. 3). We divide the Hokkaido
datacube into data chips of size 128x128 pixels (each pixel is 10m 10min spatial resolution). Since
the dataset is imbalanced, we reduce negative examples by keeping only data chips with one or more
landslide pixels, similar to Nava et al. [11]. These chips are split into training, and test sets with 216,
and 61 chips respectively. Model performance is measured using the Area Under the Precision Recall
Curve (AUPRC), as it is appropriate for imbalanced datasets. About 9% of pixels in the dataset are
labeled as landslides, which makes the baseline AUPRC 0.09.

after (c) the earthquake are shown, together with the landslides labels (d) and SRTM DEM (e). The
actual datacube covers a temporal period from 2018/07 to 2019/11, with SAR images in ascending
mode only, consisting of 18 dual polarized SAR (VV and VH) timesteps. Although not used in this
study, the datacube also contains InSAR channels (coherence and interferometry) between 16 pairs
of consecutive acquisitions.
A U-Net [ 15] model with a ResNet-50 encoder (48,982,754 trainable parameters) and varying number
of input channels is trained for 100 epochs using an Adam optimizer (weight decay=0.0001) and a
ReduceLROnPlateau2learning rate schedule (factor=0.1, patience=10, threshold=0.0001) with an
initial learning rate of 0.01. We use a standard cross-entropy loss to compare the model outputs to the
landslide segmentation masks. VV and VH channels are log-transformed and standardized before
serving as input.

Inference
Figure 3: Machine Learning pipeline from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datacube (left) to
landslide map predictions (right). SAR time-series data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) products
are ﬁrst extracted into 128x128 chips. Next, batches of chips are fed via a DataLoader into the U-Net
model with a ResNet-50 encoder. The trained U-Net model is then used to do inference and produce
landslide segmentation maps.
We test different combinations of inputs channels (shown in Figure 1) to identify the most informative
features and their combinations for the landslide detection task. Along with SAR polarimetry data
before and after the event we use as input DEM-derived features (elevation, slope, aspect and
curvature). When using multiple timesteps of SAR inputs, we take the pixel-wise mean value. This
means that using a combination of VV/VH polarimetry bands results in 4 input channels (VV before,
VH before, VV before, VV after). We test how many timesteps/satellite passes before and after the
event need to be aggregated to obtain reliable landslide segmentation predictions.
We run experiments with the following inputs:
•SAR (VV) : Only VV band before and after the earthquake (total 2 input channels).
•SAR (VH) : Only VH band before and after the earthquake (total 2 input channels).
•SAR (VV ,VH) : Only SAR bands (VV and VH) are used before and after the earthquake (total
4 input channels).

ReduceLROnPlateau.html
3•SAR+DEM : SAR bands (VV and VH) before and after the earthquake, plus DEM-derived
data (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature) are used (total 8 input channels).
For each input conﬁguration, we train using 1, 2, 3 or 4 time steps (average pixel-wise into 1 channel)
before and after the event. Notice that regardless the number of time steps we use, the number of
SAR channels remains constant as we take the pixel-wise mean value across all time steps.
All models were trained on 1 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs on the Google Cloud Platform. Training
one model requires approximately 0.25 GPU hours.
4 Results
Results of our input ablation study are shown in Fig 4. We ﬁnd that increasing the number of time
steps increases the performance of the model for all input conﬁgurations. VV is more informative
than VH for landslide detection in Hokkaido, and the combination of VV and VH achieves the best
results. Combining the SAR inputs with DEM-derived products, we can achieve better AUPRC when
only 1 or 2 satellite overpasses are available. This shows that the addition of DEM-derived data
can facilitate early detection in crisis-management scenarios. There is no evident gain from adding
DEM-derived channels when more than 2 SAR timesteps are available.

and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) inputs, from bottom to top (red: VH channel only; green: VV

It is important to note that a random model achieves a baseline AUPRC of 0.09 and a model
trained with just the DEM and DEM-derived features achieves a maximum AUPRC of 0.17. This
demonstrates the value added by SAR data and the complementarity of SAR and DEM input channels.
5 Conclusion
Rapid and automated disaster assessment is becoming more crucial than ever as climate change
increases both the severity and frequency of weather-induced disasters. Here, we have demonstrated
the feasibility of using deep learning to detect landslides from complex Synthetic Aperture Radar
data and measure the trade offs of time series data for rapid response scenarios. Both the scalability
of deep learning methods and the fact that SAR measurements are not obstructed by weather or night
time conditions have the potential to signiﬁcantly shorten assessment times.
To further foster research in this direction, and help bridge the barriers for computer vision specialists
to work with SAR data, we make public the analysis-ready data cubes for landslide detection [14].
Future work for this use case could include measuring the contribution on SAR interferometry,
self-supervised pretraining on a subset of the datacube and understanding how this model could
be applied to other regions of the world with different terrain, vegetation coverage and geological
characteristics.

7A Datacube creation
Earth Observation datacubes are analysis-ready data [ 16,17], an intermediate product ﬂexible enough
to be used by both remote sensing scientists looking at time-series data on a geographic region, and
by machine learning experts who can ingest the data as tensors into neural network models.
Multiple streams of the data processing feed into the datacubes. Given a geographical area of interest
(AOI) and a time range, we perform a spatiotemporal query to several SAR satellite data providers
that return a list of raw Sentinel-1 granules matching the search criteria. SAR data is composed of
amplitude and phase information and we handle them separately in our data pipeline.

For amplitude-based SAR products, we directly obtain Sentinel-1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected
(RTC) data hosted on Microsoft Planetary Computer3which has been processed from Ground Range
Detected (GRD) data. The RTC data is stacked both in the polarimetric channels and time to produce
an xarray dataset [18] with dimensions (time, y, x), and two polarimetric directions, VV and VH.
For the phase-based SAR product, we download the Sentinel-1 Single-Look Complex (SLC) product
from the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF). SLC data is further processed by using the phase information
of two consecutive time steps (timepair, with a start and end date) to create interferogram and
coherence maps with interferometry. SAR interferometry is used to measure the surface deformation
with differences in phase of two SAR images over a region of interest and coherence is an indicator
for agreement between the two phases. For these processing step, we used the InSAR Scientiﬁc
Computing Environment (ISCE, version 2) software package [ 19,20] developed at the NASA Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. The topsApp program of the software
is used on the interferometric wide (IW) swath mode SLC products with azimuth looks = 1 and
range looks = 5 for processing of the interferograms. This includes steps such as computing the
baseline using orbit ﬁles, co-registration with enhanced spectral diversity, calculating interferograms,
geocoding. Note that no phase unwrapping is performed here. Thus phase-derived products have
dimensions (timepair, y, x) and the data variables are ‘interferogram’ and ‘coherence’.
Besides the Sentinel-1 SAR data, we include two additional geographical datasets in our data pipeline.
The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM [ 21] is downloaded, and processed to derive
slope and aspect data layers. Landslide vector data for the multiple regions is obtained from multiple
sources [ 22,23,24,25]. The vector ﬁles from these sources are rasterized to the same pixel resolution
and spatial extent as the other raster SAR data.
Finally, we assemble all the SAR and non-SAR products into a single datacube. The datacube itself
is initialized from the RTC data with dimensions (timestep, y, x) and data variables VV and VH.
Next, the DEM and landslide labels are appended as new data variables along the y and x dimensions.
Then, the phase-derived products are appended, not just along the y and x dimensions, but also along
a new ‘timepair’ dimension containing the ﬁrst and second dates of the Sentinel-1 scenes used to
create the interferogram. All of these appended products are geographically reprojected and aligned
using rioxarray [ 26] if necessary to match the RTC template. The resulting xarray Dataset [ 18] has
dimensions (timepair, timestep, y, x) and is stored in a cloud-friendly Zarr format [ 27]. The datasets
can be found in Zenodo [14].
