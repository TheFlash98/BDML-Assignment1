ABSTRACT
In the face of significant biodiversity decline, species distribution models (SDMs)
are essential for understanding the impact of climate change on species habitats by
connecting environmental conditions to species occurrences. Traditionally limited
by a scarcity of species observations, these models have significantly improved in
performance through the integration of larger datasets provided by citizen science
initiatives. However, they still suffer from the strong class imbalance between
species within these datasets, often resulting in the penalization of rare species–
those most critical for conservation efforts. To tackle this issue, this study assesses
the effectiveness of training deep learning models using a balanced presence-only
loss function on large citizen science-based datasets. We demonstrate that this
imbalance-aware loss function outperforms traditional loss functions across vari-
ous datasets and tasks, particularly in accurately modeling rare species with lim-
ited observations.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Species distribution models (SDMs) play a crucial role in ecology, serving as indispensable tools
for understanding and predicting the spatial distribution of species. By establishing correlations
between species occurrence data and environmental variables (Elith and Leathwick, 2009), these
models provide valuable insights into the ecological niches and habitat preferences of diverse or-
ganisms, thereby informing conservation efforts (Guisan et al., 2013). The significance of SDMs
in identifying and safeguarding endangered species becomes even more pronounced as habitats of
numerous species face imminent threats from climate change (Thomas et al., 2004; Dyderski et al.,
2018). Additionally, conservation endeavors aimed at preventing biodiversity loss not only con-
tribute to mitigating climate change (Shin et al., 2022) but also play an important role in alleviating
its broader impacts (P ¨ortner et al., 2023).
These conservation efforts primarily focus on rare and endangered species, which are inherently
difficult to observe. Consequently, we have only a few observations available, posing challenges to
the development of reliable SDMs (Breiner et al., 2015). Recent initiatives in citizen science present
promising avenues to facilitate the collection of large amounts of species records. However, there
is still a high disparity in the number of observations per species, ranging from a few handfuls of
occurrences to tens of thousands for the most common or iconic species (Botella et al., 2023; Cole
et al., 2023). Such a significant class imbalance reflects the existence of various biases within the
data, which can be geographical and taxonomic, among others (Feldman et al., 2021). Additionally,
the data gathered through citizen science initiatives is typically presence-only , i.e., it consists of
recorded occurrences but no data regarding the species’ absence (Pearce and Boyce, 2006). Manag-
ing such data limitations brings additional complexities in developing accurate and reliable SDMs
for rare species.
Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for SDMs (Deneu et al., 2021; Teng et al., 2023),
by enabling the simultaneous modeling of multiple species and the identification of shared environ-

mental patterns, a characteristic particularly advantageous for rare1species (Zbinden et al., 2023).
However, the persistence of high class imbalance in training datasets (see Figure 1) often leads to the
neglect of rare species during model training, despite their critical importance. Recently, Zbinden
et al. (2024) introduced a balanced loss function to account for the class imbalance between species,
demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the model’s performance on rare species, but only on
the relatively small datasets of Elith et al. (2020). In this study, we extend their work to larger
datasets acquired through citizen science initiatives at continental and global scales (Botella et al.,
2023; Cole et al., 2023). Specifically, we train DL models with different presence-only losses and
evaluate these models on different SDM-related tasks. Our findings highlight that an imbalance-
aware loss function is essential to achieve optimal performance on rare species.
2 M ETHODS
Generally, SDMs learn correlations between the environmental features and observed species oc-
currence patterns. Depending on the downstream application, the model can also be made spatially
explicit (Domisch et al., 2019) by incorporating geospatial coordinates as additional input through
location encoders (Rußwurm et al., 2024). Multi-species distribution models aim to learn the distri-
bution of multiple species simultaneously within a single model. The task then involves multi-label
classification, as a given location may host an arbitrary number of species. However, a significant
portion of species records exists in the form of presence-only data, often with only one species
presence observation associated with a given location. This creates a scenario known as single pos-
itive multi-label learning (Cole et al., 2021), which poses significant challenges. To cope with this
scenario, a common strategy involves sampling pseudo-absences (PAs), designating samples as neg-
ative even when certainty about the absence of a species is lacking, and incorporating them into the
loss function during model training (Cole et al., 2023). Below, we describe such losses.
2.1 L OSS FUNCTIONS
The predominant approach for multi-label classification uses the binary cross-entropy loss func-
tion (Nam et al., 2014; Ung et al., 2023). For a given location with species observations represented
byy, it is defined as follows:
LBCE(y,ˆ y) =−1
SSX
s=1
1[ys=1]log(ˆys) + 1[ys=0]log(1−ˆys)
(1)
where ysis1if species shas been observed and 0otherwise, ˆys∈[0,1]is the predicted suitability
score for species s, and Sdenotes the number of species. It is essential to note that ys= 0doesn’t
necessarily imply that the species is absent; it simply indicates that it hasn’t been observed. This
1In this study, for simplicity, we refer to rare species as those with the lowest numbers of occurrences in the
training set. It is important to note that the rarity of species is a more complex concept, dependent on factors
such as range size, occupancy, and abundance (Crisfield et al., 2024).

corresponds to a PA, characterized here by the observation of another species. These specific PAs
are referred to as target-group background points in the context of SDMs (Phillips et al., 2009).
Since target-group background points are only located where other species’ observations are, they
may not entirely cover the area of interest. To address this limitation, Cole et al. (2023) extended the
BCE loss to incorporate, for each sample, a PA located at a random location with a predicted score

s, introducing the full assume negative loss function:

SSX

s)
. (2)
Here, λ= 2048 is included to counterbalance the larger number of PAs compared to presences.
However, this loss doesn’t address the high class imbalance between species, which is particularly
detrimental for rare species. To tackle this issue, we introduced class-specific weights, or species
weights, in a prior work (Zbinden et al., 2024), resulting in the full weighted loss function:
Lfull-weighted (y,ˆ y) =−1
SSX

freq( s), where np(s)denotes the number of presences
of species s, and nrepresents the total number of presence locations, i.e., the number of training
samples. Additionally, the weight λ2is introduced to modulate the impact of different types of PAs.
In this work, we extensively test these loss functions across different large-scale citizen science-
based datasets and tasks, with a particular emphasis on rare species. The datasets are described in
the following section, and training details are presented in the Appendix A.
2.2 D ATASETS
GeoLifeCLEF 2023 (GLC23). Originally designed for a competition (Botella et al., 2023), this
dataset provides an extensive collection of species observation records from various citizen science
sources. GLC23 includes a public validation set containing presence-absence data for 2174 plant
species. We use it to assess performances by calculating the mean AUC across all species. Addition-
ally, we compute a mean AUC for 468rare species (with 50observations or fewer). The distribution
of the number of presence records per species is shown in the left panel of Figure 1.
iNaturalist. We leverage the codebase, model architectures, datasets, and tasks developed in Cole
et al. (2023). Specifically, the training dataset comprises 35.5million observations spanning 47 375
species from iNaturalist2. Unlike the GLC23 dataset, all species in this dataset have a minimum of
50observations, with some species exceeding 100 000 occurrences. For computational efficiency,
we limit the number of observations to 1000 per species (see right panel of Figure 1), aligning
to Cole et al. (2023). We evaluate with the following three tasks: first, the eBird Status and Trends
(S&T ) test set (Fink et al., 2020), derived from expert range maps, which includes 535bird species.
The number of presences for these species is less imbalanced, with almost all the species having
a substantial number of observations during training. Specifically, we categorize the 96out of 535
species with less than 1000 occurrences as rare. Second, the International Union for Conservation
of Nature ( IUCN ) test set, which is more imbalanced and contains 639rare species with 100oc-
currences or less. Performance is evaluated using the mean average precision (mAP) for both the
S&T and IUCN test sets. Third, the models are assessed as geographic priors for fine-grained
image classification. This task enhances species image classification by incorporating location and
environmental metadata into the model. We calculate the top-1 accuracy gain ( ∆Top-1) by adding
SDMs to complement the vision model. The distribution of the number of presences of the species
considered in these three tasks is presented in the Appendix B.

four tasks. Notably, substantial improvements are observed in the GLC23 dataset, particularly for
rare species. This aligns well with the nature of the dataset, which contains numerous rare species
with a limited number of observations. As depicted in the left panel of Figure 2, the Lfull-weighted loss
demonstrates improved performance over the Lfullloss as the number of presences in the training
set decreases.
Results are more nuanced for the S&T dataset, where all loss functions yield similar performance.
This may be attributed to the fact that most bird species have at least 1000 observations in the
training set, as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 in the Appendix, which diminishes the effect of the full
weighted loss. In contrast, the IUCN dataset presents more variability, leading to a slightly higher
performance with the Lfull-weighted loss. Additionally, we note the significantly higher performance
on the Geo Prior task, potentially due to the test set being more balanced than the training set. Since
this task involves multi-class classification, it favors balanced loss functions. Finally, the Lfull-weighted
loss with λ2= 0.5seems to perform slightly better than its counterpart with λ2= 0.8.
4 C ONCLUSION
In this study, we emphasized the importance of effectively modeling the distribution of rare species
using deep learning, which requires addressing the high class imbalance commonly found in datasets
derived from citizen science initiatives. The presented results illustrate the advantages of employing
a balanced loss function for SDMs across three out of four datasets, demonstrating substantial per-
formance improvements for rare species. Notably, achieving equal performance on the S&T dataset,
despite its lower imbalance, suggests that imbalance-aware loss functions do not adversely affect
less imbalanced applications. Lastly, we stress the significance of considering species with very
few observations in benchmark datasets when evaluating SDMs, as is done in the GeoLifeCLEF
2023 dataset. This aspect is particularly crucial given that SDMs are most valuable when aimed at
predicting the distribution of rare and endangered species.
