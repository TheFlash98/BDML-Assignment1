Abstract
High-resolution gridded climate data are readily available from multiple sources,
yet climate research and decision-making increasingly require country and region-
specific climate information weighted by socio-economic factors. Moreover, the
current landscape of disparate data sources and inconsistent weighting method-
ologies exacerbates the reproducibility crisis and undermines scientific integrity.
To address these issues, we have developed a globally comprehensive dataset at
both country (GADM0) and region (GADM1) levels, encompassing various cli-
mate indicators (precipitation, temperature, SPEI, wind gust). Our methodology
involves weighting gridded climate data by population density, night-time light
intensity, cropland area, and concurrent population count – all proxies for socio-
economic activity – before aggregation. We process data from multiple sources,
offering daily, monthly, and annual climate variables spanning from 1900 to 2023.
A unified framework streamlines our preprocessing steps, and rigorous valida-
tion against leading climate impact studies ensures data reliability. The resulting
Weighted Climate Dataset is publicly accessible through an online dashboard at
https://weightedclimatedata.streamlit.app/ .
1 Background & Motivation
Climate change is a major driver of economic and social challenges [ 1,2]. Although research has
documented its impacts on agriculture [ 3], economic production [ 4–6], conflict [ 7], income inequality
[8], mortality [ 9], and energy consumption [ 10], a critical data gap persists. Climate data are often
available at high resolutions (daily or hourly) and gridded formats, while socio-economic data are
typically collected annually and associated with administrative units like regions or countries.
To bridge this gap, researchers typically aggregate weather data to match the lower resolution of socio-
economic data. However, this aggregation can be misleading if not done with care. Simply averaging
weather data across a region can mask important spatial heterogeneity. For example, average summer
temperatures in the Mojave Desert may be much higher than Los Angeles, but socio-economic
activity is concentrated in Los Angeles. So, labor productivity in California is likely more affected by
temperatures in Los Angeles than in the desert. Therefore, researchers are increasingly using spatially
weighted climate data to account for the varying distribution of socio-economic activities within a

region. Weighting schemes such as population density can be used to prioritize areas with higher
socio-economic activity when averaging weather data.
Despite the benefits, replicating studies using weighted climate data can be difficult. The specific
weighting procedures used are often poorly documented or absent entirely in existing research. This
lack of a transparent, standardized, documented, and open access source for spatially weighted climate
data can lead to biased results, as the choice of weighting methodology can significantly impact
analysis, hindering accurate and robust estimation of climate impacts [ 11]. This paper, by extending
a previously published version [ 12], addresses this gap by introducing the Weighted Climate Dataset ,
a unified source of data that preprocesses and weights gridded climate data. We also provide a
user-friendly interface at https://weightedclimatedata.streamlit.app/ in order to explore
and download ready-to-use, spatially weighted climate variables at national and sub-national levels
for the period 1900-2023. This promotes:
•Replicability: Improved documentation and transparency in data processing;
•Efficiency: Saves researchers time and resources by providing pre-processed data;
•Robustness: Encourages testing the sensitivity of estimates to weighting choices.
By facilitating access to a standardized dataset, we aim to enhance the climate impact assessment
community’s work and encourage robust and replicable research.
2 The Weighted Climate Dataset
Figure 1 outlines the construction of our dataset. We integrate gridded climate data from multiple
open-access sources with gridded socio-economic indicators and administrative boundaries. Our
methodology enables users to customize the weighting of climate data by various socio-economic
factors to suit their specific research needs.
2.1 Sources
Climate Data. We incorporate raw gridded climate data from four established datasets commonly
employed in climate impact research: Climate Research Unit Time-Series [ 13] (CRU TS v4.07),
2available from 1901 to 2022; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas [ 14] (CSIC v2.7),
spanning 1901 to 2020; ECMWF Reanalysis v5 [ 15] (ERA5), covering 1940 to 2023; and University
of Delaware [ 16] (UDEL v5.01), ranging from 1900 to 2017. CRU TS, UDEL, and CSIC offer
monthly data at a spatial resolution of 0.5◦×0.5◦, whereas ERA5 provides data at a higher resolution
of0.25◦×0.25◦. All sources provide monthly records of average temperature (in Celsius degrees,
◦C) and total precipitation (in millimeters, mm), with the exception of CSIC, which uniquely offers
an additional monthly climate variable: the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index
[17], also known as SPEI (unit free). In addition to monthly data, ERA5 also provides records at
the temporal resolution of hours . We aggregate these hourly data into daily values. Specifically, we
calculate daily total precipitation (by taking the sum of hourly measurements), and average, minimum,
and maximum temperature. Finally, ERA5 also provides 10-meter hourly wind speed measurements
(measured in meters per second, m/s), which we aggregate into daily maximum wind gust.
Socio-economic Data. To capture the spatial distribution of economic and human activity, we
incorporate five weighting schemes based on socio-economic variables. First, population density data
are available from Columbia University’s Gridded Population of the World v4 (GPWv4) [ 18], and
measured at 0.25◦and0.5◦spatial resolutions. To accurately represent population size, we multiply
population density by grid area. Second, night-time light data [ 19], measured in digital number values
(DN) and originally available at a 30 arc-second spatial resolution ( 0.0083◦), are incorporated after
averaging to 0.25◦and0.5◦resolutions. Third, cropland data are available from the History Database
of the Global Environment (HYDE) [ 20], version 3.2, and are measured in square kilometers. These
data are recorded at a spatial resolution of 5 arc-minutes ( 0.083◦), and are incorporated after averaging
to0.25◦and0.5◦resolutions. Users can select population density, night-time light, or cropland as
weighting factors, with base years of 2000, 2005, 2010, or 2015. Fourth, climate data can be weighted
solely by grid cell area, an option referred to as unweighted . Finally, for a dynamic approach, we
provide a concurrent weighting strategy where climate variables are weighted by population counts
from the beginning of the respective decade. For instance, temperatures in 1907 are weighted using
population data from 1900. Population counts are derived from HYDE v3.2 [ 20] for 1900-2010 and
GPW for 2020.
Administrative Boundaries. We utilize two administrative levels from the Global Administrative
Areas Database (GADM v4.1, released July 16, 2022) [ 21]. The coarser GADM0 level corresponds
to country boundaries, while the finer GADM1 level represents the largest subnational administrative
units (e.g., states for the US).
A summary of the data sources and further information about our preprocessing pipelines can be
found in the Supplementary Material.
2.2 Aggregation
We employ a general weighted aggregation scheme to calculate climate variables at the administrative
unit level. The weighted value, yi,t,w,T , for climate variable yin geographic unit i(at a specified
GADM resolution) at time tusing weight wmeasured in base year T∈ {2000,2005,2010,2015}is
computed as
yi,t,w,T =P
j∈Jiajfi,jwj,Txj,tP
j∈Jiajfi,jwj,T, (1)
where Jirepresents the set of grid cells intersecting unit i,fi,jis the fraction of grid jwithin unit i,
ajis the area of grid j, andxj,tis the raw gridded climate value. Typically, the base year Tis fixed,
aligning with common practices in the literature [ 4,22]. However, the concurrent weighting scheme
uses a dynamic base year, setting Tas the start of the decade containing t. In the unweighted case,
wj,Tequals 1 for all jandT. For cropland and concurrent weighting, the grid area term ajis set to 1.
As an example of the aggregation strategy, Figure 2 shows three panels. The left and center panels
display raw gridded data for night-time light intensity in 2015, and ERA5 average annual temperatures
in 2015 for the contiguous US, respectively. Night-time lights are chosen as the weighting variable
in this example. Figure 2, right panel, displays the resulting aggregation at GADM1 resolution and
illustrates the output that users can retrieve from our dataset.
In the Supplementary Material, aiming to support the reliability and effectiveness of our approach,
we validate the quality of our dataset by comparing it with those employed in two influential climate
econometric exercises [4, 6].

2.3 Customization
TheWeighted Climate Dataset dashboard provides several ways to customize the aggregated data.
Users can select specific time intervals and choose between daily ,monthly , orannual frequencies.
Notice that annual data are derived by aggregating daily or monthly values (e.g., summing monthly
total precipitation). The SPEI is an exception, available only monthly due to its complex calculation.
To analyze extreme weather events, users can also define absolute ,relative , and cumulative thresholds.
The dashboard, by exploiting daily data provided by ERA5, then calculates the frequency of days
exceeding these thresholds for each geographic unit, month, or year. For relative thresholds, per-
centiles are calculated based on the historical distribution for each region or country. For cumulative
thresholds, instead of computing the frequency, the dashboard provides the sum of the residual values
that exceed the threshold.
Data can be downloaded from the dashboard in two different formats: the wide format has geographi-
cal units as keys and values of a climate variable in different years as attributes; the long format has
geographical units and years as keys, and the value of a climate variable as only attribute. Data can
also be downloaded in three different extensions ( csv,json , and parquet ).
3 Discussion
TheWeighted Climate Dataset offers a valuable resource for the climate impact assessment com-
munity, providing a standardized framework for evaluating and refining models and methodologies.
By democratizing access to a comprehensive suite of datasets, we aim to propel research on the
complex interplay between climate change and socio-economic dynamics. This resource allows
researchers to further investigate the mechanisms through which climate variability and extremes
influence economic growth, inequality, and other critical social factors. Ultimately, by enhancing our
understanding of these relationships, the Weighted Climate Dataset can contribute to more informed
decision-making, effective policy development, and public engagement in addressing the challenges
posed by climate change.

A Additional information on sources
A.1 Climate data
CRU TS utilizes raw meteorological data collected from a vast network of weather stations. Monthly
deviations from average climatic conditions, known as anomalies, are calculated and subsequently
interpolated using a method called Angular-Distance Weighting (ADW) [ 13]. ADW is employed
to account for the varying size of grid cells on the spherical Earth, specifically by considering the
cosine of the latitude for each grid cell. This cosine value serves as a proxy for the change in grid cell
area with respect to latitude. It is recognized that grid cells near the equator encompass larger areas
compared to those closer to the poles.
CSIC leverages the CRU TS dataset to generate the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
Index (SPEI), a drought index that comprehensively assesses both the severity and duration of
drought conditions by incorporating information on precipitation and evapotranspiration. This index
represents a standardized adaptation of the widely used Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which
considers the combined influences of precipitation and temperature on water availability. Due to its
multi-scalar nature, the SPEI can distinguish between different types of drought; for the present study,
we concentrate on the one-month timescale to examine fluctuations in headwater levels.
ERA5 is a climate dataset that incorporates data collected by radiosondes, battery-powered instru-
ments carried aloft by weather balloons to measure atmospheric parameters such as temperature, wind
speed, and humidity. The data transmitted from these radiosondes to ground stations are integrated
into the ERA5 dataset alongside observations from satellites and surface-based instruments through
the utilization of numerical weather models, resulting in a comprehensive representation of the Earth’s
climate system [ 15]. As a unique reanalysis product, ERA5 combines climate models with historical
observations to deliver (i) consistent data over time and (ii) enhanced accuracy in grid areas without
measurement stations.
Finally, UDEL provides gridded climate estimates primarily based on station records obtained
from various publicly accessible sources (e.g., Global Historical Climatology Network dataset [ 23],

Global Historical Climatology Network Monthly dataset [ 24], Daily Global Historical Climatology
Network archive [ 25]). The interpolation process is carried out using the Shepard spatial interpolation
algorithm [26], modified to accommodate the near-spherical shape of the Earth.
A.2 Socio-economic data
Night-time light and cropland data require preprocessing prior to analysis. Night-time light data
consists of digital number (DN) values, a standardized measure of pixel brightness ranging from 0 to
63. Initially available at a high-resolution of 30 arc-seconds ( 0.0083◦), these data were aggregated to
match the coarser resolutions of our gridded climate data ( 0.25◦and0.5◦). This was accomplished
by calculating the mean DN value for blocks of 900 (30 ×30) and 3600 (60 ×60) most upper-left cells
in our coordinate system. We then iterate this procedure with the adjacent blocks of cells to obtain
all gridded values of the night-light data for the coarser resolution. It is important to note that the
harmonized VIIRS-DMSP dataset, particularly for the year 2015, contained noise from sources such
as auroras and transient phenomena (e.g., boat lights, fires) as illustrated in Figure 3 (left panel). To
address this, following the approach of [ 19], DN values below 30 were set to zero prior to aggregation.
The impact of this correction is visualized in Figure 3 (right panel) for the year 2015.
Cropland data quantify the area, in square kilometers, dedicated to arable land and permanent crops
within each grid cell. Originally recorded at a spatial resolution of 5 arc-minutes ( 0.083◦), these data
were aligned with the coarser resolutions of our climate datasets through an aggregation process
identical to that applied to the night-time light data.
A summary of the main characteristics of the original data sources is provided in Table 1.
B Further details on aggregation
We observed inconsistencies in grid resolution across different datasets. ERA5 data are provided
in aNetCDF file with a 721 ×1440 grid, spanning from 180.125◦W to 179.875◦E and 90.125◦S to
90.125◦N, at a 15 arc-minute resolution. In contrast, socio-economic data at 0.25◦utilize a 720 ×1440
grid, extending from 180◦W to 180◦E and 90◦S to 90◦N. To align ERA5 data with socio-economic
variables for weighting and analysis, we employed bilinear interpolation to resample the ERA5
weight grids. This process is visually illustrated in Figure 4, which compares the grid structures of
the two data sources. This resampling procedure was applied consistently when combining ERA5
climate variables with population density, night-time light, cropland, and concurrent population count
data.

and annual total precipitation (meters) variables in our datasets against data used in [ 4] (countries)
and [ 6] (sub-national regions). Data points falling on the main diagonal indicate strong agreement
between the estimates.
Both climate and socioeconomic datasets exhibited sporadic missing values. To maintain data integrity,
we adopted a conservative approach. When accurate climate variable weighting was hindered due
to factors such as zero-valued weights or missing climate data within specific geographic units, we
opted to retain the missing values (NAs) rather than imputing estimates.
C Validation
This section validates our dataset against those used in influential climate econometric studies [ 6,4].
By comparing our weighting procedures to theirs, we assess the reliability and effectiveness of our
approach.
To ensure a rigorous validation, we replicated the exact data sources used in these studies, including
older versions of climate and economic data. This enables us to verify the accuracy and robustness of
our data processing pipeline and to objectively evaluate the quality and consistency of our estimates.
[4] utilized UDEL v3.01 for precipitation and temperature data, and GPW v3 at 0.50◦gridded
population data for the year 2000. While the specific source and version of administrative boundaries
are unspecified, their shapefiles are publicly accessible. In contrast, [ 6] employed 0.25◦gridded
ERA5 precipitation and temperature data without applying any weighting, using GADM1 v3.6 for
spatial aggregation in their primary analysis.
9Figure 5 presents scatterplots comparing our average temperature and rainfall estimates with those
from the original studies by [ 4] and [ 6] (SPEI, wind gust, and other summary statistics of temperature
data were not used in either study). Data points aligned along the main diagonal of these plots indicate
strong agreement between the estimates. Our analysis reveals a high degree of concordance between
our estimates and the weighted or aggregated data used by previous researchers across all study
years. This supports the quality and reliability of our dataset and methodologies. However, minor
discrepancies were observed. The first panel in Figure 5 highlights two key differences between our
estimates and those of [ 4]. Lower-left quadrant points represent negative temperatures in Greenland,
where our estimates are exceeded by the ones of [ 4]. Conversely, Bhutan exhibits slightly higher
estimates in our data compared to [ 4]. These discrepancies primarily stem from the weighting scheme,
particularly the concentrated population density in specific regions of Greenland and Bhutan.
