Shepherd University of Reading Reading, UK theodore.shepherd@reading.ac.uk Abstract Identifying large-scale atmospheric patterns that modulate extremes in local-scale 1 variables such as precipitation has the potential to improve long-term climate 2 projections as well as extended-range forecasting skill. This paper proposes a 3 novel probabilistic machine learning method, RMM-VA E , based on a variational 4 autoencoder architecture for identifying weather regimes targeted to a local-scale 5 impact variable. The new method is compared to three existing methods in the 6 task of identifying robust weather regimes that are predictive of precipitation over 7 Morocco while capturing the full phase space of atmospheric dynamics over the 8 Mediterranean. RMM-VA E  p e r f o r m s  well across these different objectives, 9 outperforming linear methods in reconstructing the full phase space and 10 predicting the target variable, highlighting the potential benefit of applying the 11 method to various climate applications such as downscaling and extended-range 12 forecasting. 13 1 Introduction 14 Large-scale atmospheric circulation modulates the occurrence of regional extremes such as heavy 15 precipitation and heatwaves [1]. These extreme events cause devastating impacts to people and 16 livelihoods across the planet as recently witnessed in the tragic flooding events in September 2023 17 in Libya [2]. In a changing climate, preparing for these extreme events becomes even more 18 important which requires, on the one hand, an understanding of their projected long-term changes 19 to make well-informed and robust adaptation decisions, and on the other hand, an improvement of 20 their near-term prediction skill to give people and other stakeholders such as governments and 21 humanitarian organizations more time to prepare ahead of an upcoming event. 22  23 To achieve this, investigating the low-frequency variability and patterns of the large-scale 24 atmospheric flow and their link to regional extremes is important, as they can act as mediators 25 between global patterns of change in the climate system and regional impacts. One common 26 approach to analyzing this low-frequency variability is the identification of recurrent and persistent 27 atmospheric states, so-called weather regimes. Typically, weather regimes are identified based on 28 statistical dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques informed by a physical understanding 29 of the underlying dynamics [3]. Such atmospheric circulation patterns have been used to disentangle 30    2 dynamic and thermodynamic components of climate change for extreme event attribution, to 31 downscale or bias-adjust climate models [4]–[6], and to quantify the role of atmospheric internal 32 variability in observed trends [7], [8]. Moreover, weather regimes have been shown to improve the 33 usability and skill of forecasts at sub-seasonal-to-seasonal timescales [9]–[12]. 34  35 To identify weather regimes, a combination of dimensionality reduction and clustering is commonly 36 applied to gridded geopotential height or sea level pressure data of the region of interest. Following 37 [13], principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means have established themselves as common 38 choices for dimensionality reduction and clustering respectively, although various other linear 39 statistical methods have been studied in the field [3]. Recent publications have also explored non-40 linear [14] and probabilistic [15] methods for identifying weather regimes. 41  42 While the relationship between weather regimes and extremes in local impact variables (e.g. extreme 43 precipitation) is a key motivation for their investigation, there are no comprehensive methods 44 available for identifying probabilistic weather regimes targeted to a specific impact variable, without 45 compromising regime completeness or persistence [16]–[18]. By 'targeting' weather regimes, we 46 mean identifying patterns in the high-dimensional space of atmospheric dynamics that are 47 particularly predictive of the local-scale variable in question while still capturing the full dynamics 48 of the atmospheric phase space. As this last point is particularly relevant for extending the forecast 49 range of the impact variable through the extended range predictability of the patterns, building a 50 purely predictive ML model of the impact variable is not useful in this context.  51  52 This paper presents a novel probabilistic machine learning method for identifying weather regimes 53 that captures the full phase space of atmospheric dynamics in a reduced space while providing 54 enhanced predictability of a local scale impact variable. The proposed method, which we call RMM-55 VAE (Regression Mixture Model Variational Autoencoder), integrates both targeted dimensionality 56 reduction using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and probabilistic clustering using a mixture model 57 (MM) into one coherent statistical model, extending previous machine learning architectures 58 reported in [19], abbreviated R-VAE (Regression - VAE) here, that incorporate a co-variate into the 59 dimensionality reduction step of a VAE model, without combining it with a clustering. 60  61 To demonstrate the performance of the RMM-VAE method, it is compared to existing methods in 62 the task of identifying weather regimes targeted to precipitation over Morocco, which serves as our 63 target variable here. To evaluate the performance of RMM-VAE, we compare our method to two 64 established approaches (PCA + k-means, and CCA + k-means), as well as the R-VAE method 65 combined with k-means clustering (R-VAE + k-means). The performance of all methods is assessed 66 on three possible objectives of targeted clustering: reconstruction of the input space, persistent and 67 well-separated clusters, and predictive skill with respect to the target variable.  68 2 Proposed RMM-V AE method 69 Figure 1 (left side) shows a schematic of the proposed method RMM-VAE. We introduce a scalar 70 co-variate t into the inference model, extending the architecture developed by [19] by conditioning 71 the dimensionality reduction on a probabilistic cluster assignment [20], [21]. Using the graphical 72 model shown in Figure 1 (right side), the joint probability distribution of the model is obtained and 73 the loss function derived using Bayesian Variational Inference [22] (details in appendix A).  74  75    3  76 Figure 1: Left side: Schematic diagram of the RMM-VAE method which combines a regression VAE (R-VAE, 77 based on [19]) with probabilistic clustering using mixture models (MM). Right side: RMM-VAE model written 78 as a probabilistic graphical model in plate notation to facilitate the derivation of the loss function using 79 Bayesian variational inference. x represents the high-dimensional input data, z the latent space with prior 𝜙! 80 depending on the cluster assignment, as well as parameters 𝜃 depending on the cluster assignment, t the scalar 81 target variable, with probabilistic cluster assignment c with prior 𝜋". In both panels, dashed lines indicate the 82 inference model and solid lines the generative model. 83 3 Experiments 84 The performance of RMM-VAE is compared to two more established linear statistical methods, 85 namely PCA and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), respectively combined with k-means 86 clustering. The performance of the integrated, probabilistic clustering implemented in RMM-VAE 87 is also compared with a version that separates targeted dimensionality reduction in an architecture 88 based on [19] with a separate k-means clustering step (R-VAE + k-means). A description of PCA, 89 CCA, k-means and a standard VAE architecture can be found in [23], and a derivation of the R-90 VAE method in [19]. 91  92 Table 1 provides an overview of the compared methods along with relevant hyperparameters. A 10-93 dimensional latent space was implemented for all the methods, and cluster numbers between 4 and 94 10 were investigated. For both VAE methods, the inclusion of a hyperparameter 𝛽 [24] which 95 changes the weight of the reconstruction term in the loss function was investigated (v1 and v2).  96 Table 1: Overview of the methods applied to the identification of weather regimes and associated 97 parameter choices 98  99 Abbr.

The data was standardized by subtracting the daily 103 mean and dividing by the standard deviation over the considered time period. ERA5 reanalysis data 104 of daily total precipitation data in a region over Morocco (latitude: 30°N — 36°N; longitude: 11°W 105 — 0°E) over the same time period were used as the target variable. Precipitation data was 106 normalized by applying a Box-Cox transformation at each grid cell. A three-day average of daily 107 
   4 total precipitation around each day was taken to mirror methodologies previously applied in the 108 study of precipitation extremes over the Mediterranean [25]. The same was applied to z500 data to 109 match the two datasets. 110 4 Results 111 Analyzing the latent space of the four methods shown in Figure 2 (top row), we find that both of the 112 targeted VAE methods, RMM-VAE and R-VAE + k-means, disentangle the dimension in the latent 113 space associated with the target variable, which is in line with the findings presented by [19] for the 114 R-VAE method. However, what is interesting is that the cluster assignment (Figure 2, bottom row) 115 differs between the two methods: R-VAE + k-means, which carries out the cluster assignment in a 116 separate step, identifies the clusters in bands along the dimension associated with the target variable. 117 In contrast, RMM-VAE, which integrates a probabilistic cluster assignment with the targeted 118 dimensionality reduction, shows less organization of the clusters with respect to the target variable. 119  120 The performance of the dimensionality reduction component was analyzed by computing the root 121 mean square error between the reconstructed space and the original input data. We find that both 122 VAE methods outperform the two linear statistical methods, and that decreasing the weight of the 123 reconstruction loss term (𝛽<1) in the v2 versions increases the reconstruction loss. When 124 investigating the reconstruction of individual data points, we find that decreasing the 𝛽-parameter 125 focuses the dimensionality reduction on the region immediately surrounding Morocco. The 126 figures to support these results are shown in the supplementary appendix B. 127  128 
 129 Figure 2: Visualization of the 10-dimensional latent space reduced to two dimensions using t-distributed 130 stochastic nearest-neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Different values of perplexity were tested and perplexity=10 131 was chosen as it shows representative results. Embedded data points are colored first according to the target 132 variable, total mean precipitation (top row) with darker colors referring to stronger precipitation, and then 133 according to the cluster they are subsequently assigned to in the corresponding clustering method (bottom 134 row).  135 Investigating the predictive performance of the clusters using the Ranked Probability Skill 136 Score (supporting derivation and figures shown in supplementary appendix C), we find that 137 both V AE methods outperform both CCA and PCA up to a cluster number of 9, which shows 138 the potential of targeting weather regimes to a local impact variable by introducing a co-variate 139 to a V AE architecture. While the R-VA E  +  k-means method outperforms RMM-VA E  i n  t e r m s  140 of predictive skill, the R-VA E + k-means clusters are less persistent and separable compared 141 to RMM-VA E, assessed using the silhouette score. In both methods, the v2 versions which 142 deprioritize the reconstruction term in the loss function (𝛽<1) identify clusters with higher 143 predictive skill but lower cluster persistence and separability, compared to the respective v1 144 versions (𝛽=1). This finding highlights the trade-off between the predictive skill of weather 145 regimes for a given target variable, which would be maximized in a purely predictive model, 146 and identifying robust clusters, which is important for using the weather regimes for extended-147 range prediction and for linking regional extremes to global patterns of climate change.  148 
   5 5 Conclusion 149 The paper introduced a novel machine learning method, RMM-VAE, for the identification of 150 weather regimes with respect to a scalar target variable. The novelty of this method lies in 151 developing an architecture that combines non-linear, probabilistic, and targeted dimensionality 152 reduction with probabilistic clustering using mixture models in a coherent Bayesian probabilistic 153 framework. The new method performs well across all the different objectives analyzed, 154 outperforming the linear methods in reconstructing the full phase space and in predicting the target 155 variable. Compared to the other machine learning method, R-VAE + k-means, the proposed RMM-156 VAE method loses in predictive skill but identifies more persistent and separable clusters, which is 157 relevant for various climate applications such as extended-range forecasting or the downscaling of 158 climate models, highlighting the potential benefit of applying the RMM-VAE method to these use-159 cases. In future work, we are planning to analyze the dynamical processes captured by the targeted 160 clusters and extend the architecture to identify joint clusters between two high-dimensional spaces.  161    6 Acknowledgments 162  163 Include only in final version. 164 References 165  166  [1] T.

The RPS is defined as 𝑅𝑃𝑆=265 /0	∑∑3	𝛿1"2−𝑝2<3=−/0	∑(1−2𝑝1"+∑𝑝23	)	425/065/425/065/, and the score (RPSS) calculated 266 with respect to a reference forecast, chosen here to be the climatology over the entire period: 267 
   9 𝑅𝑃𝑆𝑆=1	−	789#$%&'()*789'+,-(*$+$./ , with m forecast categories and N timesteps. 𝛿1"2 is the Kronecker delta 268 and equals 1 if the observation i at timestep n corresponds to category j, and 0 otherwise. The RPSS 269 is a strictly proper scoring rule to measure the accuracy of a probabilistic prediction of mutually 270 exclusive discrete outcomes [26]. A RPSS of 1 indicates a perfect forecast while low values indicate 271 little, or no skill compared to the reference forecast. Here, we construct a forecast of the target 272 variable given the occurrence of a weather regime and the conditional probability of the target 273 variable given that weather regime: each discrete target is forecast with a probability corresponding 274 to the probability of the weather regime at this given day, multiplied by the climatological 275 conditional probability of the target given the weather regime. 276  277
