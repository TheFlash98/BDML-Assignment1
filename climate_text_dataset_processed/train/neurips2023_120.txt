Abstract
Sustainable global development is one of the most prevalent challenges facing
the world today, hinging on the equilibrium between socioeconomic growth and
environmental sustainability. We propose approaches to monitor and quantify sus-
tainable development along the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), including
mathematically derived scoring algorithms, and machine learning methods. These
integrate socioeconomic and environmental datasets, to produce an interpretable
metric for SSP alignment. An initial study demonstrates promising results, lay-
ing the groundwork for the application of different methods to the monitoring of
sustainable global development.
1 Introduction
To address the ongoing climate crisis, global socioeconomic progress must be balanced with environ-
mental sustainability. However, assessing a region’s overall development trajectory with this balance
in mind poses a complex challenge. Progress is typically monitored with respect to warming limits of
1.5◦C and 2◦C using self-reported nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of emissions [ 7]. A
study of European cities integrated environmental and socioeconomic datasets and applied machine
learning techniques to assess emissions reduction efforts [ 3]. Despite substantial literature on country-
level mitigation pathways, not all countries are well represented [ 7]. In climate change mitigation
research, reference scenarios are used to evaluate possible low-carbon strategies; policymakers and
researchers tend to focus on an individual scenario, which can limit the scope of understanding [2].
In 2017, the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were introduced: (1) Sustainability, (2)
Middle of the Road, (3) Regional Rivalry, (4) Inequality, (5) Fossil-fueled Development [ 10,8]. These
characterise the ways in which socioeconomic factors and atmospheric emissions may change in the
coming century; analysis in 2020 identified over 1370 studies utilising the SSPs [ 9]. SSP projection
datasets for complex, and sometimes competing, socioeconomic and environmental features are
available from the year 2015, projected ahead to 2100. While the SSPs are presented as potential
pathways, rather than ideal pathways or targets, they can be used to contextualise current development
trajectories. With this in mind, the SSP projections can be compared to observational data to evaluate
the development sustainability of different regions relative to the established SSPs. With an increasing

the communication of climate scenario research [ 9]. Thus, we propose the application of data science
and machine learning methods to distill these existing datasets into a single, interpretable score.
These methods will act as pivotal tools to assist decision-makers in addressing the climate crisis, and
monitoring sustainable socioeconomic development.
2 Proposed methods
Here we propose the distillation of environmental and socioeconomical features into a single inter-
pretable metric, to evaluate development against established scenarios. We propose initial investiga-
tion into mathematical methods: norm induced measures, to simply quantify the difference between
observations and SSPs, and TraCE (Trajectory Counterfactual Explanation) scores [ 1], which treat
SSPs as counterfactual instances; as well as exploration of machine learning methods to better capture
complex relationships. Additionally, scores from independent methods can be ensembled, to more
robustly quantify SSP alignment than any single approach. These methods can be applied at a range
of spatial scales, from regional to global.
2.1 Norm induced measures
Given a norm such as the Euclidean ∥f∥2=qR
Ωf(x)2dx, we consider the difference between
ground truth uiand target SSP vifor each feature ias the error ei=ui−vi. The norm measures the
average error between truth and target by finding ∥ei∥over the domain of interest Ωiand dividing by
time frame length (or discrete number of points). This measure is summed over all features (with
weight wifor each feature), and divided by the sum of the weights to obtain a score:
S=1
∥w∥2nX
i=1wi∥ei∥2 (1)
This method allows for varying resolutions between features without interpolation. Weights can be
selected to allow greater contribution of important measures to the score than other features. Using
this method, if S= 0 = ⇒e= 0and therefore u=v, an SSP is followed perfectly. Sis therefore
unbounded but strictly positive, with a larger value of Sindicating a larger value for eand therefore
worse alignment with an SSP.
Preliminary results are presented in Section 3, with all features equally weighted.
2.2 TraCE scores
TraCE [ 1] outputs a score Sbetween −1and1, derived from the combination of an angle metric
R1(xt, x′
t)and a distance metric R2(xt, x′
t), weighted by λ∈[0,1]:
S(xt, x′
t) =λR1(xt, x′
t) + (1 −λ)R2(xt, x′
t) (2)
Positive values of Sindicate that a factual instance, xt, representing historical observations, is moving
towards a target, x′
t, representing an SSP projection; negative values indicate movement away from
the SSP. Target point selection and λare user-adjustable parameters to be informed by domain
expertise. λcan also be implemented as a learnable function from machine learning methods, or
calibrated using the outputs of other scoring methods.
Informed by user priorities or a specific research question, we propose exploring input feature
weighting, which can be assigned individually or by grouping features, for example into economic
and environmental categories. An exploration of TraCE score presentation will identify the most
useful summary statistics and visualisations for communicating results with stakeholders.
Section 3 presents a preliminary study, with λ= 0.9, and all features weighted equally.
2.3 Time series classification
Using supervised machine learning methods, time series classification algorithms can be applied
to labelled SSP projection datasets. Observational time series data for a given region can then

comparison of a region’s alignment with each SSP in turn. Approaches of interest include deep
learning architectures, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks [ 5,6], and transformers
[11, 4].
3 Preliminary study
An initial exploratory study leverages global data from 2015 to 2022. Five features from historical
environmental (temperature, precipitation, methane) and socioeconomic (population, GDP) data
are compared against corresponding SSP projections at each time point, to quantify country-level
alignment with each SSP. By distilling alignment across these features into a single value, sustainable
development trajectories can be quantified both within and between countries. Scores for a single
regional time series are shown in Figure 1a, as the overall norm induced measures for Brazil. With
this method, alignment for Brazil is strongest with SSP5 (Fossil-fueled Development) and SSP1
(Sustainability). TraCE scores are shown in Figure 1b for multiple regions, with countries generally
aligning most strongly with SSP5. Germany scores lower across all SSPs, with little variation between
different pathways, while Italy instead aligns most highly with SSP3 (Regional Rivalry). Future work
could investigate how alignment patterns may vary at different spatial scales, and how these may be
explained by computing scores at the feature level.
4 Responsible implementation and impact
Here we propose the development of a framework to monitor sustainable development. With an
interpretable approach to reconcile numerous and sometimes conflicting features, non-experts are
able to quickly assess alignment with SSP scenarios. This is particularly useful because manual
assessment of raw data becomes increasingly challenging as more features are included. These
methods can therefore enable improved communication between stakeholder groups.
To ensure fully informed implementation, this work requires active engagement with experts across
domains encompassing environmental, social, and economic sciences. Several factors will affect
results, including the selection of data features and their weighting, and the model sources for SSP
projection data. This in turn will affect the conclusions drawn about the trajectories of regions in
alignment with the different SSPs. Reported results must therefore clearly discuss these considerations
and the implications of choices made. Implementation must also explicitly acknowledge that these
analyses do not attribute sole responsibility to specific regions for the SSP alignment outcomes. This
is because the observed features used for monitoring one region’s alignment can be influenced by the
actions of other regions.
We envision this work as a component of a broader toolkit for applications such as monitoring real-
time trajectories, and emissions simulation experiments, providing an output metric to quantify SSP
3alignment. This will enable decision-makers to effectively monitor current development trajectories,
and evaluate the impact of possible actions in the context of the climate crisis.
