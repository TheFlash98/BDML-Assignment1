Abstract
An accurate and precise understanding of global irrigation usage is crucial for
a variety of climate science efforts. Irrigation is highly energy-intensive, and as
population growth continues at its current pace, increases in crop need and water
usage will have an impact on climate change. Precise irrigation data can help
with monitoring water usage and optimizing agricultural yield, particularly in
developing countries. Irrigation data, in tandem with precipitation data, can be
used to predict water budgets as well as climate and weather modeling. With our
research, we produce an irrigation prediction model that combines unsupervised
clustering of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal signatures
with a precipitation heuristic to label the months that irrigation peaks for each
cropland cluster in a given year. We have developed a novel irrigation model and
Python package ("Irrigation30") to generate 30m resolution irrigation predictions
of cropland worldwide. With a small crowdsourced test set of cropland coordinates
and irrigation labels, using a fraction of the resources used by the state-of-the-art
NASA-funded GFSAD30 project with irrigation data limited to India and Australia,
our model was able to achieve consistency scores in excess of 97% and an accuracy
of 92% in a small geo-diverse randomly sampled test set.
1 Introduction
Understanding global irrigation patterns, both the extent of cropland and water usage, can enable
various climate science efforts. Irrigated cropland accounts for 70% of global freshwater use
(R. Q. Grafton et al., 2018). As population growth continues, the cropland required to keep up
with food demand will signiÔ¨Åcantly increase greenhouse gas productions (Tillman et al., 2011).
This cropland demand will be particularly located in developing countries, where population and
consumption growth are disproportionate. Furthermore, precise irrigation data enables various climate
science applications like crop water productivity modeling (Deryng et al., 2016) and global biomass
estimation (Mauser et al., 2015). To sustainably meet this existential challenge, a precise and accurate
understanding of global irrigation usage is required.
Despite the need for accurate global irrigation data, current data sources are outdated, low-resolution,
and potentially inaccurate. With our research, we develop a machine learning model that estimates

deliver a Python package1that allows researchers to make use of our irrigation model and generate
irrigation predictions for small regions at a time.
2 Related Work
Meier et al. (2018) created a global irrigation map at 30 arcsec (approx. 0.9km at the Equator)
through downscaling a lower-resolution statistically-based global irrigation map and analyzing remote
sensing data. However, the median crop Ô¨Åeld size is far less than 1km2in the mainland United States
(0.278km2), and even smaller in Asia and Africa (Yan et al., 2016; Fritz et al., 2015). To accurately
measure the irrigation extent, a higher-resolution mapping is needed on a global scale.
The Global Food Security-support Analysis Data @ 30-m (GFSAD30) project provides irrigation
labels at 30m resolution, although these irrigation products are currently limited to a few regions
and data is accessible by visualization only (i.e., no downloadable content).2An earlier effort from
the GFSAD team generated Ô¨Åve-class global cropland extent, which marked irrigation and rainfed
extent at 1km resolution for nominal year 2010 (Thenkabail et al., 2016). Xie et al. (2019) used a
semi-automatic training approach to map irrigated cropland extent across the conterminous United
States at 30m resolution. At the time of writing, there are no publications that produce 30m resolution
irrigation mappings on a global scale.
3 Research Methodology
3.1 Data Sources
While many recent publications on irrigation detection used Landsat satellite data (Yan et al., 2016;
Xie et al., 2017; Oliphant et al., 2019; Gumma et al., 2020; Phalke et al., 2020), Sentinel-2 satellite
data was chosen for this analysis because of its higher revisit frequency (a Ô¨Åve-day revisit frequency
over land surface as compared to 16-day revisit frequency for Landsat 8). The shorter revisit period of
Sentinel-2 allows monthly time series data to be more representative and less inÔ¨Çuenced by factors that
cause outliers like cloud coverage. Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument covers 13 bands at resolutions
ranging from 10 to 60 meters. We use NDVI, the normalized difference between near-infrared band
and red band, as a measure of cropland vegetation coverage and its healthiness.
Climate data, such as precipitation, is also used in our analysis. TerraClimate provides global monthly
climate data at 2.5 arc minutes, which is approx. 4.2km at the Equator (Abatzoglou et al., 2018).
We use the GFSAD30 global cropland map at 30m resolution to remove non-cropland from our
analysis (Xiong et al., 2017; Teluguntla et al., 2017; Oliphant et al., 2017; Gumma et al., 2017; Phalke
et al., 2017; Massey et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2017; Congalton et al., 2017). The global GFSAD30
cropland products deÔ¨Åne areas of cropland, non-cropland, and water bodies.
We use Google Earth Engine (GEE) to manage and process all data and analysis for this research.
Sentinel-2 and TerraClimate are accessible via GEE, while GFSAD30 cropland data was manually
uploaded as an asset to GEE.
Credible and publicly available irrigation-labelled data is hard to come by. Other research teams have
collected independent validation data to complement the publicly available crowdsourced labelled
data in their analyses (Congalton et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2019). We use crowdsourced irrigation
data from croplands.org3for evaluation but not model training, because their data does not provide
complete global coverage.
3.2 Exploration
We chose an unsupervised approach to identify irrigated cropland. Clustering analysis is a commonly
used technique to identify groups of objects sharing similar patterns. Land use patterns can be
observed through the change in NDVI over a 12-month period.

each month of 2019 by cluster.
3.3 Localized approach
Performing clustering analysis on the global satellite data at 30m resolution is neither practical due
to the size of the data, nor effective due to weak signal-to-noise ratio. To reduce noise, we perform
clustering analysis on cropland only, and limit our analysis to bounded regions with edge length of
0.5 degrees. Our approach can be summarized in three steps:
1. Mask cropland - The GFSAD30 products were used to remove non-cropland areas.
2.Cluster - Clustering analysis was performed on monthly NDVI values on identiÔ¨Åed cropland
areas only. Multiple clustering algorithms were tested, including K-Means, Agglomerative
clustering, and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(HDBSCAN). Algorithms were evaluated based on the Silhouette CoefÔ¨Åcient, the Calinski-
Harabasz Index, and the Davies-Bouldin Index. K-Means was chosen for its consistency in
performance and reduced compute complexity.
3.Determine cluster labels - A heuristic approach was used to determine the cluster label for
each cluster independent of one another. With this heuristic, we identify crop seasons based
on NDVI peaks. NDVI peaks must be at least three months apart to be assigned separate
crop seasons (FAO, 1986; Sys et al., 1993). A crop season is labelled as irrigated, as opposed
to rainfed, if it satisÔ¨Åes the following criteria:
3.1. The NDVI peak is greater than 0.3 - Kotsuki et al. (2015) assumes that NDVI peak
less than 0.4 does not indicate cultivation. The article uses 10-day composite NDVI
while monthly NDVI is used in this analysis. Due to the averaging effect, the monthly
NDVI peak should be almost always lower than the 10-day NDVI peak. Therefore, a
threshold slightly lower than 0.4 was selected.
3.2. Average precipitation is less than water need - Average precipitation is calculated using
the month before the peak and the month at the peak. There are two reasons why only
these two months were taken into consideration. First, the average growing period
varies greatly from crop to crop, ranging from three months to eleven months (FAO,
1986). Second, depending on whether the crop is fresh-harvested or dry-harvested, the
water need can deviate after the mid-season (FAO, 1986). Without knowledge of the
crops planted at the area of interest, only the months before and at the peak are used to
calculate the average precipitation. The average monthly water need for crops is usually
above 100mm (FAO, 1986). Since there is a large variation of growing periods and
water needs not only between crops but also within a crop type, the 100mm threshold
was selected by default. However, we reduce this precipitation threshold to 85mm for
crop seasons with temperature below 15C as there is less water need for cropland
growth (FAO, 1986).

#2 (Geo-diverse) Irrigation30 0.92 N=25
3.4 Global approach
An area of interest of any size can be segmented into many small rectangular areas. Each small
rectangular area can be modeled in parallel. We ran the model for all of Idaho, USA in parallel on
GEE as a proof of concept, and the irrigation predictions can be found on our GEE assets.4
4 Evaluation Methodology and Results
Given that there are no comprehensive data sources for irrigation at 30m resolution, we conducted two
case studies to compare our irrigation predictions against global crowdsourced data from croplands.org
and randomly sampled coordinates from GFSAD30‚Äôs irrigation products in India and Australia
(Gumma et al., 2020). As GFSAD30‚Äôs irrigation products are not published datasets and only
accessible via a map interface, points must be sampled and assessed manually.
In our Ô¨Årst case study (#1), we randomly sampled 10 cropland coordinates from GFSAD30‚Äôs irrigation
products that correspond to labeled crowdsourced coordinates, which acted as our source of truth.
At the time of this study, GFSAD30 released 30m resolution irrigation labels exclusively in India
and Australia, so our Ô¨Årst case study is limited to these geographies. The accuracy of our model
is comparable to GFSAD30‚Äôs irrigation product, with 70% and 80% accuracy, respectively, when
compared against the croplands.org crowdsourced labels.
In our second case study (#2), we randomly sample 25 geo-diverse cropland coordinates from over
15 countries spanning Ô¨Åve continents using the same croplands.org dataset. Our irrigation predictions
coincide with crowdsourced labels for 92% of the coordinates. The results for both case studies are
shown in Table 1. More evaluation is required on a larger sample size to increase our conÔ¨Ådence in
these accuracy levels.
Lastly, we test the consistency of our model with a custom consistency metric that compares predic-
tions for input regions against an overlapped, spatially-shifted input regions. For each coordinate
tested, we compare predictions from an input region against eight translated regions that have been
shifted by 1/3of the edge length of the input region either vertically or horizontally. Of the points that
overlap in the regions, we compare the consistency of irrigation predictions for each 30m pixel. Using
12 randomly sampled global cropland coordinates, our model‚Äôs predictions are internally consistent
for 97% of the pixels that overlap, indicating that the model is not sensitive to moderate perturbations
of the selected input region.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
With the impact of energy-intensive water usage on climate change, it is essential now more than
ever to track global irrigation data at high-resolution. Our model (Irrigation30) demonstrates that
unsupervised techniques can be used for predicting the irrigation status of cropland at unprecedented
resolution, in any geolocation. With a geographically diverse test set from croplands.org, the
Irrigation30 model correctly predicts the irrigation status of 23-of-25 cropland coordinates. While
more evaluation is recommended for greater conÔ¨Ådence in accuracy levels, we found that our model
was insensitive to perturbations of selected input regions, as our custom consistency metric was
consistent for 97% of pixels tested in our third case study. As for future work, we are currently
working on self-supervised contrastive learning for irrigation modeling to help improve results.
