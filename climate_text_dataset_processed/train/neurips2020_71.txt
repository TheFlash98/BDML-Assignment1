Abstract
Separating the household aggregated power signal into its additive sub-components
is called energy (power) disaggregation or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring. NILM
can play an instrumental role as a driver towards consumer energy consumption
awareness and behavioral change. In this paper, we propose EnerGAN++, a
model based on GANs for robust energy disaggregation. We propose a uniﬁed
autoencoder (AE) and GAN architecture, in which the AE achieves a non-linear
power signal source separation. The discriminator performs sequence classiﬁcation,
using a recurrent CNN to handle the temporal dynamics of an appliance energy
consumption time series. Experimental results indicate the proposed method’s
superiority compared to the current state of the art.
1 Introduction
Raising awareness of individuals on environmental protection and sustainability, is prerequisite to set
climate policies, responses or solutions to climate change at global scale ( 1). There are various ways
that householders could contribute to sustainable living. One of them is by reducing their energy
consumption. To this end, a change of energy related behavior in the household is required. First,
consumers need to become aware of their energy consumption. However, end-consumers often lack
knowledge about potential energy savings, existing policy measures and relevant technologies. Most
household consumers are usually aware of general information related to their consumption through
monthly electricity bills. Nonetheless, the information about energy consumption is not translated
into good practices and tailored advice for energy saving.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) uses the aggregate power signal of a household as input to
estimate the extent to which each appliance contributes to the aggregate energy consumption signal.
Thus, NILM algorithms can be considered as an efﬁcient and cost effective framework for energy
consumption awareness, especially given the fact that installing smart plugs in households to provide
a fully personalized solution is not a cost-effective alternative. The goal of the work at hand is to
propose an efﬁcient framework for NILM that can be applied to enhance awareness on the energy
consumption behavior of consumers in the household and therefore guide them towards a prudent
and rational utilization of energy resources.
A brief literature review on NILM methods reveals that deep learning techniques have been applied
to low frequency NILM since 2015 ( 2). Recurrent Neural Netowrks (RNN) and their variants, such
as LSTMs and GRUs have been primarily used, as they are effective with 1D time series data.
Relevant studies have been carried out in the past ( 3), (2), (4). Other works include a Bayesian

external environmental conditions ( 6). Some works ( 7) propose a sequence to point CNN architecture,
underscoring the importance of sliding windows to handle long-term timeseries. Additionally, seq2seq
architectures (8) as well as denoising autoencoders (9) have also been proposed.
2 Problem formulation and paper contribution
Measuring consumption per appliance can be effected with smart plugs, which is however an
economically ineffective solution. For this reason, NILM methods can be applied to decompose the
total power consumption of a household into individual appliance power signal components without
prior existence of smart-plug equipment.
At a discrete time index t, we assume ~p(t)the noisy aggregate measured energy signal for the whole
household under study. Signal ~p(t)is the sum of the individual appliances’ power consumption
pj(t)plus an additional noise (t). Thus, in a NILM framework ( 10), we express the total power
consumption ~p(t)as:~p(t) =PM
m=1pm(t) +(t). Variablemrefers to the m-th out ofMavailable
appliances. Here, we need a robust to noise model able to separate the total noisy power measurements
~p(t)into the individual -free of noise- appliance source signals pm(t). The problem is to calculate
the best estimates ^pm(t)of the appliance power consumption, given the noisy ~p(t)values.
NILM methods often look at the problem as decomposing a mixture signal into individual appliance
signals and formulate the task as an optimization problem. Traditional generative models such as
independent component analysis (ICA) ( 11) and non-negative matrix factorization ( 12) have been
proposed to solve the NILM problem. However, it would be interesting to replace the linear ICA
model with an alternative model to capture the non-linearities in energy data consumption signals.
In this paper, we propose EnerGAN++, a GAN-based approach that employs a combined convo-
lutional layer with recurrent GRU unit which can model the long-range dependent and recurrent
behaviors of appliances’ data consumption. In this way, the performance and robustness of NILM
modelling is increased in the cases that noisy aggregate signals are used as input triggers and abrupt
changes in the appliance energy distributions are encountered.
3 The proposed EnerGAN++ Model: Generator and Discriminator
The Generator: The NILM framework implies the need for a network trained not only to repro-
duce the distribution of the power signal of an appliance but also to know its exact operation and
consumption at a given time instance t. This can be achieved by using the aggregate signal f~ptgt=t+T
t=t
over a time window of Tduration as input trigger to EnerGAN++ (see Fig. 3). Signal f~ptgt=t+T
t=tis
considered as a noise trigger since it is the summation of independent energy consumption signals of
the appliances. In addition, during training, the ground truth data of the m-th appliancefplabel
m;tgt=t+T
t=t
over a time window of Tduration is considered to initiate the EnerGAN++ generator to simulate the
real energy consumption data of the m-th appliance. We denote by Itrain the input trigger vector of
theGEnerGAN ++()generator during the training phase: Itrain
f~ptgt=t+T

t=tT. To
handle the aggregate signal f~ptgt=t+T
t=tand the ground truth labels of fplabel

of EnerGAN++, an encoder layer is added prior to the decoder. This generates a compressed noise
signalzm(by encoding the input vector signal of Itrain ) which is used as input trigger of the decoder
of the generator to produce a real appliance energy consumption time series G(zm)for them-th
appliance. Thus, the pipeline of the generator during the training phase is the following:
Itrain!Encoder (Itrain)!zm!Decoder (zm)!G EnerGAN ++(zm) (1)
Eq. (1) means that the input signal Itrain
f~ptgt=t+T

pressed) to a latent noise trigger zm, through a convolutional encoder and then, the noise signal
zmis decompressed to generate a signal GEnerGAN ++(zm)that resembles the real energy con-
sumption of the m-th appliance. The encoder with convolutional layers, is forced to be an inverted
version of the decoder (with transposed convolutional layers), where corresponding layers perform
opposite mappings and share parameters ( 13). The model tries to minimize the difference between

The output of the generator during the testing phase approximates its output during training since
the ground truth data of the m-th appliance are available only during training. Therefore, we have

The Discriminator: In the EnerGAN++ model, a combined CNN enriched - GRU classiﬁer is
adopted as the discriminator unit. GRU networks are appropriate for modelling the temporal auto-
regressive properties of a time series. However, GRU structures cannot extract features from the input
data in a way to optimize the overall classiﬁcation performance. For this reason, in this paper, we
adopt a combined approach by introducing a CNN model ( 14) prior to the GRU framework. The com-
bination of CNN as an efﬁcient feature extractor with the GRU model, is capable of representing, syn-
thesizing and therefore distinguishing the temporal dynamic nature of the power sequence signals. The
proposed discriminator has two main components: the convolutional layer and the GRU unit. The con-
volutional layer transforms the input signal to a reliable feature vector fD(t), while the GRU unit per-
forms the discrimination. As input signal the generated power signal GEnerGAN ++(^zm)of them-th
appliance is used. In addition, the labeled training samples of the respective appliance fplabel

and the aggregate measurements f~ptgt=t+T

4 Experimental Evaluation
The evaluation has been conducted on nine appliances from AMPds ( 16) and REFIT ( 17) datasets,
which provide aggregate power measurements of a house and sub-metered readings (smart plugs)
from individual appliances. Table 1 shows the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) attained by our model
and other state of the art methods. In most cases, EnerGAN++ attains the lowest MAE, with the
exception of the clothes dryer appliance, where MAE seems to be higher. This could be due to
the “jagged edges” appearing in clothes dryer appliance pattern, that are successfully captured by
the bidirectional-LSTM. Fig. 2 shows the aggregate signal (grey line), the generated power signal
from our model (purple line) and the ground truth data (orange). The operation of each appliance is
detected at an adequate level. In Fig. 2, the generated timeseries of power data are identical with the
actual operation (ground truth) of clothes dryer, oven, kettle, microwave, toaster, tumble dryer and
washing machine appliances. However, during the snapshot in time in Fig. 2, for the heat pump, a
false positive appeared, since the appliance is detected in operation ﬁve times, whereas it is actually
ON only 4 times. On the contrary, a false negative is detected, at ﬁrst, for the dishwasher, but actually
the orange undetected signal for this case indicates noise and not actual presence of the dishwasher.
5 Conclusions
NILM is a useful tool for providing consumers with personalized information regarding their energy
consumption. In this paper we propose a novel GAN-based approach for NILM, with promising
results, that could be applied as the basis technology in a recommendation engine system guiding
consumers towards behavioral change and energy waste reduction.
