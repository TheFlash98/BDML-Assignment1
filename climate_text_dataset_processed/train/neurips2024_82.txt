Abstract
Climate awareness and climate anxiety often go hand in hand.The growing aware-
ness of climate change among young people is increasingly shadowed by climate
anxiety, a condition marked by profound stress, fear, and a sense of helplessness
stemming from overwhelming information on environmental crises and perceived
inaction by authorities. Our proposal is an innovative approach using Large Lan-
guage Model (LLM)-based chatbots to support children and adolescents in fostering
climate awareness, managing climate anxiety, and promoting sustainable practices.
By collaborating with schools and engaging multidisciplinary experts and the
young people themselves, we seek to co-create an impactful educational interven-
tion. Starting with a comprehensive survey of school counsellors to map the current
state of climate awareness and anxiety, and to understand their expectations for
our AI solution, this project is poised for global scalability, addressing the pressing
mental health challenges associated with climate change, particularly in vulnerable
and resource-constrained regions.
1 Introduction and Related Work
A significant proportion of children in the UK, specifically 70% of those aged 12–18 years, express
concern about the world they will inherit due to climate change [ 17]. In a study spanning ten
countries—including Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Portugal,
the UK, and the USA—84% of young people aged 16–25 reported being worried about climate
change [ 10]. The intersection of climate awareness and related worries has become increasingly
prominent, particularly among young people who are simultaneously confronted with the realities of
environmental crises and the perception of inadequate action by authorities [ 1]. This dual burden often
manifests as climate anxiety, characterised by pervasive stress, fear, and a sense of hopelessness [ 10].
As young individuals become more informed about the dire consequences of climate change, their
mental health is increasingly at risk, necessitating the development of effective coping mechanisms.
The discourse surrounding climate anxiety underscores the critical need for community involvement,
informed activism, and specialised therapeutic interventions to mitigate the psychological toll of
climate-related stress [5, 1, 10].
Recent studies reveal that personal experiences with global warming are significantly shaping public
concern, particularly among younger demographics [ 5]. The Handbook of Climate Psychology delves
into these psychological impacts, offering strategies to manage the emotional responses triggered
by climate change [ 1]. Additionally, research published in The Lancet highlights the prevalence of
climate anxiety, especially among youth, and calls for targeted mental health interventions to address
this growing concern [ 10]. Several resources have explored the psychological dimensions of climate
anxiety, emphasising the urgent need for both individual and systemic solutions. For instance, Yale
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.experts have explained how climate anxiety functions as a multifaceted response to the perceived
threat of climate change, advocating for community engagement and active involvement in climate
action as effective coping strategies [ 18]. Similarly, psychologists have researched the prevalence of
climate anxiety across various demographics, suggesting that both individual coping mechanisms
and broader systemic changes are necessary to address the underlying causes of climate-related
stress [ 6].Mental Health UK offers practical advice for managing climate anxiety, including the
importance of staying informed, participating in environmental activism, and seeking professional
support when necessary [ 20]. Furthermore, the Harvard Health Blog discusses the link between
climate change and anxiety-related sleep disturbances, proposing management tips that include
proactive environmental engagement and maintaining a healthy lifestyle [ 3]. The Natural History
Museum has also contributed by suggesting eco-therapy and community support as strategies for
dealing with eco-anxiety, reinforcing the therapeutic benefits of nature and active participation in
environmental solutions [ 15]. Technological solutions, such as climate chatbots, as evidenced by
platforms such as BBC Climate News [ 2] and ChatNetZero [ 4], have also been designed to offer
information and demystify concepts related to climate change. The Earkick chatbot [ 7], a mental
health AI assistant, also focus on mental health interventions for climate anxiety.
While these tools provide valuable insights, they are predominantly designed for adult users or a
general audience, leaving a substantial gap in addressing the unique needs of children and adolescents,
who are disproportionately affected by climate anxiety [ 13]. There is an urgent need to develop
solutions specifically tailored to young individuals grappling with the psychological impacts of
climate change, as their well-being is crucial for the future of our society. The integration of large
language models (LLMs) into chatbots offers a promising avenue for achieving this goal, which are
currently being developed to support queer youth [ 14], monitor digital wellbeing [ 8], and adolescent
cyberbullying education [ 9]. When developed responsibly, LLM-based chatbots have the potential to
deliver natural, empathetic interactions at scale, providing personalised support to youth and helping
them navigate their anxiety in a way that feels both authentic and accessible. By harnessing the
power of these advanced technologies, we aim to create a new set of tools that not only address the
mental health challenges posed by climate change but also empower young people to take informed,
responsible actions for a sustainable future.
Through strategic partnerships with schools, we aim to seamlessly integrate our initiative into existing
educational frameworks, starting with a comprehensive survey of school counsellors in the Global
North to assess the current state of climate awareness and anxiety among students, and to understand
their expectations for our AI solution. The project will be meticulously co-designed with input
from experts in psychology, climate science, education, AI, and, most importantly, the young people
themselves. This collaborative approach ensures that our interventions are scientifically robust and
deeply aligned with the lived experiences of the children they are intended to support. Furthermore,
by utilising open-source LLMs, with region-specific augmentation, the initiative holds significant
potential for scalability across diverse countries, contexts, and languages. By addressing these
pressing mental health challenges on a global scale, our project has the potential to foster a resilient,
informed generation ready to confront the realities of climate change.
2 Methodology
2.1 Objective, Scope, and Risks
Objective: The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement Large Language
Model (LLM)-based chatbots specifically designed to assist children and adolescents in managing
climate anxiety. These chatbots aim support youth to channel climate-related worry into constructive,
collective actions and promote resilience strategies such as mindfulness, smart-media consumption,
and social activities that can transform anxiety into a catalyst for meaningful change.
Scope: Our primary target is teenagers, who are not only highly susceptible to climate anxiety but
also possess the agency to influence change within their communities, often referred to as “teen power”
[12]. By integrating the chatbot into school environments, this project aims to ensure widespread
accessibility and impact, particularly in resource-limited settings where the effects of climate change
are most acute.
Risks: We acknowledge the limitations of the chatbot as a supplementary tool, rather than a replace-
ment for systemic climate action or professional counselling. To mitigate risks, the chatbot will
2be implemented alongside blended approaches that incorporate human counsellors and/or trained
educators. A comprehensive risk assessment framework will address potential issues, including data
privacy, bias, hallucinations, emotional impact, and the dissemination of misinformation.
2.2 Phase 1: Needs Assessment
Survey and Interview Design: To gain a clear understanding of the current landscape, we will
begin with a comprehensive survey of school counsellors, assessing the prevalence of climate anxiety,
levels of climate awareness, and gaps in existing support systems. Following this, we will conduct
qualitative focus-group interviews with groups of teenagers to explore their personal experiences
with climate anxiety, coping strategies, and expectations for the AI chatbot.
Data Analysis: Quantitative data will be statistically analysed to identify key trends in climate anxiety
and awareness. Thematic analysis will be applied to qualitative data from interviews, allowing us to
extract common themes and insights that will inform the chatbot’s design and functionality.
2.3 Phase 2: Chatbot Design and Development
Co-Design Workshops: With the insights from Phase 1, our multidisciplinary team comprising of
psychological experts, climate scientists, educators, AI specialists, and adolescents will engage in a
series of interactive workshops to co-design the chatbot’s features, ensuring they are scientifically
accurate, developmentally appropriate, and user-friendly.
Chatbot Development: Using an iterative agile process, the open-source LLM-based chatbot, initially
implemented with LLAMA [ 19], will provide real-time emotional support, climate education, and
promote sustainable behaviours. Key features include accurate information, empathetic responses,
good user experience, robust user safety, and data security. To ensure scientific accuracy, the
chatbot will integrate localised climate data and peer-reviewed data from trusted organisations, cured
by domain experts to ensure cultural relevance and contextual appropriateness. To mitigate bias,
hallucinations, misinformation and to check for any other risks in the chatbot’s responses, we will
perform red-team testing [ 21] with the assistance of domain experts. Fact-checking mechanisms will
be integrated into the chatbot to ensure outputs are limited to verified climate data and resources.
Additionally, the model will undergo adversarial training and rigorous security testing to reduce
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, enhancing its robustness and reliability. Furthermore, the insights
curated from the co-design workshops will be channelled towards creating a robust interaction
layer prompt architecture [ 22], to enhance user experience with proactive, reliable, and personalised
exchanges.
Pilot Testing: The pilot phase will focus on evaluating the chatbot’s usability, engagement levels,
region-specific alignment, and its effectiveness in reducing climate anxiety and increasing climate
awareness. Feedback from students and teachers during this phase will be used to make necessary
adjustments before broader implementation.
2.4 Phase 3: Implementation and Scaling
Training and Support: Ensuring adoption, school counsellors and teachers will receive training on
both the technical aspects of using the chatbot, led by AI researchers in our team, and best practices for
addressing climate anxiety within educational settings, led by the psychologists and climate scientists
in our team. To prevent harm or the spread of disinformation, real-time monitoring systems will be
employed, alongside user feedback loops and pre-defined safety responses. These measures will
ensure that potentially harmful interactions are promptly identified and addressed. Transparency will
also be prioritised by incorporating explainability features into the chatbot’s outputs and maintaining
oversight by human moderators during the deployment phase.
Scaling Strategy: After successful pilot testing and initial deployments, we plan to forge partnerships
with educational and mental health organisations worldwide, with a special focus on the Global
South, where the impacts of climate change are increasingly evident in daily life. Our goal is to refine
and deploy our societal resilience solution across diverse languages and contexts. Recognising the
potential cultural differences between the Global North and the Global South, the chatbot will be
co-designed through region-specific workshops, repeating Phases 1 and 2, involving local experts,
educators, and adolescents. This approach ensures cultural relevance and contextual appropriateness.
3Regionally tailored datasets will be developed to fine-tune the model for linguistic and cultural
sensitivities. Furthermore, iterative pilot testing will be conducted in diverse regions to identify and
address mismatches in messaging before scaling.
Evaluation The expected outputs of the chatbot include measurable improvements in climate literacy,
reduced anxiety levels, and increased adoption of sustainable behaviours among teenagers. Success
will be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative metrics, such as pre- and post-interaction anxiety
scores, user satisfaction surveys, Chatbot Usability Questionnaire [ 11] , Technology Acceptance
Model [ 16] and engagement rates. Alongside longitudinal studies, real-time feedback mechanisms
will be implemented to monitor and refine the chatbot’s performance continuously.
3 Impact and Conclusion
Our societal resilience project aims to significantly reduce climate anxiety among teenagers by
providing responsible, personalised, accessible support through open-source, LLM-based chatbots.
This initiative will enhance climate literacy, reduce climate anxiety, foster responsible behaviours, and
empower young people to take meaningful actions against climate change. Designed for scalability
and adaptability across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts, the chatbot will be a valuable, free
resource with global impact, particularly in regions most affected by climate change. By addressing
mental health challenges at scale, our project leverages AI to equip the next generation with the
resilience and knowledge needed to lead in the fight against climate change.
