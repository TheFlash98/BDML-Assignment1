Abstract
When cloud layers cover photovoltaic (PV) panels, the amount of power the panels
produce ﬂuctuates rapidly. Therefore, to maintain enough energy on a power grid
to match demand, utilities companies rely on reserve power sources that typically
come from fossil fuels and therefore pollute the environment. Accurate short-term
PV power prediction enables operators to maximize the amount of power obtained
from PV panels and safely reduce the reserve energy needed from fossil fuel sources.
While several studies have developed machine learning models to predict solar
irradiance at speciﬁc PV generation facilities, little work has been done to model
short-term solar irradiance on a global scale. Furthermore, models that have been
developed are proprietary and have architectures that are not publicly available or
rely on computationally demanding Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models.
Here, we propose a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network model that
treats solar nowcasting as a next frame prediction problem, is more efﬁcient than
NWP models and has a straightforward, reproducible architecture. Our models
can predict solar irradiance for entire North America for up to 3 hours in under 60
seconds on a single machine without a GPU and has a RMSE of 120 W=m2when
evaluated on 2 months of data.
1 Introduction
Solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation has gained signiﬁcant popularity and attention in the
past few decades. According to studies, it is expected to account for almost 80% of the increase
in renewable energy generation through 2050 [ 1]. Moreover, solar power is required to reduce the
25% of global greenhouse gas emissions that stem from the energy sector each year [ 2,3]. Despite
its popularity, environmental-friendliness and the vast amount of energy available, solar power is
associated with intermittency and uncertainty – its output can substantially rise or fall instantaneously
based on the cloud layers between the sun and the solar panels.
To avoid power blackouts and damage of equipment, electricity grids need to remain balanced within
a narrow range at all times. This is typically accomplished by utilizing backup generators [ 4], and
sometimes using battery reserves [ 5] and demand-response scheduling [ 6]. However, these solutions
have their own limitations. As for the most popular solution, backup generators run on fossil fuels
and their power ascend and decline rate is restricted by the unit ramp rate which results in difﬁculties
to meet incremental power generation needs [ 7]. Large-scale battery technologies on the other hand
are expensive and difﬁcult to realize. Lastly, demand-response scheduling is challenging due to the

solar energy production may allow a utility to store energy in advance or avoid spinning reserves thus
improving cost-effectiveness and security [8, 9, 10, 11].
Recently, solar power prediction has been widely studied using ground data and satellite imaging.
For example, Hu et al. uses ground-based images to predict production at a solar plant in Hangzhou,
China [ 12]. There has also been much research aimed at predicting PV power over a geographical
range, such as Mathe et al. [ 13], where they trained a deep learning model on satellite images in
order to predict total daily PV output for the entire nation of Germany. Numerical weather prediction
(NWP) models (such as one used by Verbois et al. [ 14]) are often used for solar irradiation prediction,
which involve extensive computational overhead and are more suitable for predicting long-term
horizons (e.g. days). Furthermore, utility-scale solar farms invest in developing their own models to
predict power production but the distributed nature of solar installations with millions of small sites
encourages automated and efﬁcient prediction models for a wide area.
In this paper, we predict solar irradiance using a Convolutional LSTM model architecture for the
entire North America. We use satellite images of irradiance and treat this as a next-frame prediction
problem; this allows for the development of a model that is simple, computationally efﬁcient, and
reproducible. Since each pixel in the predicted frame represents a geographic area, predictions can be
made at both the local and national scales. Our models predict solar irradiance for North America
for up to 3 hours in under 60 seconds on a single machine without a GPU and has a RMSE of 120
W=m2when evaluated on 2 months of data.
2 Data and Methodology
A standard approach to predict future solar irradiance consists of using weather features to compute
and predict irradiance. Many factors must be considered to determine solar irradiance such as cloud
type, cloud depth, aerosol type, aerosol depth, ozone, wind speed, wind direction, ground location
and solar zenith angle. This information is needed for every prediction location, which makes
traditional numerical modeling processes very complex and computationally intensive. Instead of
approaching this as an numerical weather problem, we approach it as a computer vision problem
using the GOES-16 data as described below.
2.1 Data (GOES-16)
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16 (GOES-16), operated by NASA, is a weather
satellite that continuously provides downward shortwave radiation at the surface (DSR) data. DSR
is the total amount of shortwave radiation (both direct and diffuse) that reaches the Earth’s surface.
The solar energy industry needs estimates of DSR for both real-time and short-term forecasts for
building energy usage modeling and optimization [ 15]. This data is updated hourly and automatically
processed by our pipeline from Registry of Open Data on AWS2.
2.2 Methodology
Our goal is to predict DSR values for North America for 3 hours into the future. Three DSR images
of size 166 x 394 belonging to hours t-2, t-1 and t are used as input to the model to predict DSR
images for t+1, t+2 and t+3 . Using 3 input images, provide the model with not only the historical
DSR values, but also how it moved in the last 3 hours. One-hot encoding of month and hour of the
day are also embedded in these input images to account for sun’s position [16].
2.2.1 Linear Regression
Linear regression was selected as a simple baseline. Last 3 hours of DSR are used as our input to
predict next hour’s DSR. Every DSR image consist of 65,404 pixels which means every input has
a dimension of 196,212 and prediction has a dimension of 65,404. A linear model trained on this
input/output conﬁguration will be very large, and it would undermine our goal of developing a simple
and efﬁcient approach. To increase efﬁciency, we scaled down to make pixel-wise predictions for the
linear model. The model output is a single pixel and the input is 40 by 40 image sample from the

DSR images from previous 3 hours. The result shows that the model assigned ﬁxed weights to prior
hour pixels. Hence, spatio-temporal movements of the DSR are not learned. Most other models not
leveraging LSTM will have similar problem where ﬁxed weights are assigned to pixels rather than
learning the pattern of movements.
2.2.2 Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network (ConvLSTM)
The goal of the model is to precisely predict the downward shortwave radiation for a relatively short
period of time, for e.g. 0-3 hours. For the sake of computational efﬁciency and to predict the DSR for
a wider area, we treat this problem as a spatiotemporal sequence prediction problem. Shi et al[ 17]
formulated precipitation now-casting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem that can be
solved under the general sequence-to-sequence learning framework proposed in [ 18]. In order to
model the spatiotemporal relationships, they extend the idea of FullyConnected-LSTM to ConvLSTM
which has convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions. By stacking
multiple ConvLSTM layers and forming an encoding-forecasting structure, we build an end-to-end
trainable model for nowcasting downward shortwave radiation.
Our network is comprised of 2 ConvLSTM layers with 128 kernels of size 5x5 separated by a batch
normalization layer followed by another ConvLSTM layer with 64 kernels of size (5,5). All the
ConvLSTM layers use same padding and ReLU activation. This is followed by a regular Conv3D
layer to produce output of the desired shape. This uses same padding and a sigmoid activation to
squash the values between 0 and 1. We trained our model using MSE loss.
Our experiments indicate that training different models for predicting each of the 3 hours were more
accurate than one model predicting all three hours’ DSR images. The model trained to predict ﬁrst
hour DSR has the output sequence t-1, t, t+1 , second hour model has output sequence t, t+1, t+2 and
third hour has t+1, t+2, t+3 . The last image in each output sequence is the prediction.
Cell Variations - To see if we can improve the results from ConvLSTM model, we experimented
modifying the ConvLSTM cell by introducing a peephole connection and let the gate layers inspect
the cell state of the same memory block [ 19]. We call this a ConvLSTMPeephole cell. In another
experiment, we combined the input and forget gates into an update gate to see if it can deliver
results similar to ConvLSTM model by improving computational efﬁciency [ 20,21]. We call this a
ConvGRU cell. In both these cell variations, we replaced the Hadamard product with the convolution
operation to match with the ConvLSTM cell.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Error Evaluation
Table 1 provides a summary of the RMSE values for our predictions made for the two-month
test set. These results are broken down by prediction hour as well as the range of the true DSR
value. Exploring any potential differences in performance based on DSR ranges may be useful for
demonstrating that our model is effective in a variety of weather/climatic conditions. From the results
in Table 1, we see that the ConvLSTMPeephole model outperforms the other models for the ﬁrst
and third hour predictions, while the unaltered ConvLSTM model performed slightly better for the
second hour prediction.
Baseline Comparison Test evaluation ﬁgures from Table 1 are based on the full DSR images.
However, due to the computational challenges with the linear regression, the baseline was tested
on a subsection of the DSR images encompassing the state of California. Predictions made by the
baseline for this subsection were compared with our ConvLSTM model. The Linear Regression and
ConvLSTM models had a RMSE of 104.6 and 71.4 W=m2respectively.
3.2 Comparison to Numerical Weather Prediction
We compared predictions made by the ConvLSTMPeephole model to High Resolution Rapid Refresh
(HRRR), a numerical weather prediction model that is operated by the U.S federal government [ 22]
and requires more than 10 TB of memory to run [ 23]. We examined predictions at 22 sites (17 large
solar farm sites and 5 urban centers) between the hours of 10:00AM to 3:00PM PST for four weeks
of the test set. The results are summarized in Table 2. Predictions made by our model resulted in a
13.08% decrease in RMSE. These results demonstrate that by approaching DSR prediction as a next
frame prediction problem, we can achieve results that are comparable to NWP models while avoiding
the computational overhead.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we looked at short term solar irradiance prediction as a next-frame-prediction problem
and is advantageous in several ways over NWP models. The data used for training and testing is
4made publicly available by NOAA, and can be used as inputs to the model with minor pre-processing.
Once trained, running our models require only a single virtual computer without a GPU. Inference
time is under 60 seconds, meaning predictions can be delivered to the end user with enough time
to make use of the information. We have made predictions available via our REST API, which is
updated hourly to provide predictions in real-time. Future work may involve including more number
of input images, adding channels (e.g. infrared, near-infrared and visible) to these input images to see
how this may improve performance. In addition, NOAA operates geostationary satellites that collect
similar spectral data all across the globe. Training our model on data from other regions around the
world would provide insight about the effectiveness of our approach on a global scale.
