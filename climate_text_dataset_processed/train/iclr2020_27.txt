ABSTRACT
I propose the use of Machine Learning techniques such as Active Learning(AL)
and Transfer Learning(TL) to translate climate information and adaptation tech-
niques from major Western and Asian languages to thousands of low resource
languages in the developing world. Studies have shown that access to information
can help people assess the magnitude of the climate change challenge, possible
options and those feasible within the relevant context (Nyahunda & Tirivangasi,
2019) I endeavour to demonstrate that if this information was available in a lan-
guage the locals can understand, it would result in local empowerment and as a
result inspire action.
1 INTRODUCTION
I propose the use of Machine Learning(ML) techniques such as Active Learning(AL) and Transfer
Learning(TL) with improvements Liu et al. (2018) to translate climate information and adaptation
techniques from major Western and Asian languages to thousands of low resource languages in
the developing world. Studies have shown that access to information can help people assess the
magnitude of the climate change challenge, possible options and those feasible within the relevant
context Nyahunda & Tirivangasi (2019). I endeavour to demonstrate that if this information was
available in a language the locals can understand, it would result in local empowerment and as
a result inspire action. Without an automated approach, building evaluation sets on low-resource
languages is both expensive and time-consuming because the pool of professional translators is
limited, as there are few Ô¨Çuent bilingual speakers for these languages Guzm ¬¥an et al. (2019), Ambati
(2012). This solution would be very impactful considering that these languages are spoken by
a large fraction of the world population Guzm ¬¥an et al. (2019). Global warming, which occurs
when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere
and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth‚Äôs surface Pappas (2017), is
one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today Rolnick et al. (2019). It continues to affect
natural habitats and biodiversity with disruption on growing season, phenology, primary production,
and species distributions and diversity (Bellard et al., 2012). The proposed ML applications will
be pivotal to the communities in Northern Kenya that continue to be affected by Climate change
Huho (2015) through prolonged droughts that have threatened their livelihoods and as result caused
conÔ¨Çict van Baalen & Mobj ¬®ork (2017) Schilling et al. (2012) since these communities scramble for
the increasingly less available natural resources like water and pasture for their animals, by availing
climate information in a language locally understood and techniques to adapt to the effects of the
phenomenon. The effect is well pronounced by the fact that about a third of the Kenyan population
depends on pastoralism for food and income security, KNBS (2010).
2 OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the proposal are;
1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
to demonstrate that communities in Northern Kenya contribute to and are affected by Cli-
mate change,
to examine the gap that exists in climate information and techniques to adopt to the phe-
nomenon due to language barrier and possible impacts to local empowerment
to show that ML techniques can be used to translate information from English to low re-
source languages like those used in Northern Kenya
to explore the impact ML applications to bridge this gap would have on the communities
3 L IVESTOCK CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS CLIMATE CHANGE
In as much as pastoralism communities in northern Kenya have undergone evolution they largely
continue to keep large numbers of livestock as per Kaye-Zwiebel & King (2014) and Hauck &
Rubenstein (2017) that contribute towards global warming (Hauck & Rubenstein, 2017). It is esti-
mated that the livestock sector contributes 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving
further climate change (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017). The risks of this phenomenon are apparent in
agriculture, Ô¨Åsheries and many other components that constitute the livelihood of rural populations
in developing countries (Adger & Kelly, 1999). According to Hurst et al. (2005), the livestock
sector contributes to the livelihoods of one billion of the poorest population in the world and em-
ploys close to 1.1 billion people out of which 1 billion people live in the areas like Northern Kenya
(Rojas-Downing et al., 2017).
4 G AP IN CLIMATE INFORMATION DUE TO LANGUAGE BARRIER
A study by otieno & Pauke (2010) has shown that climate change terminology is poorly understood
and does not have standard translations in Swahili, Luo and other local Kenyan languages. This
prevents many people from having a voice on the issue or even fully grasping it. Further studies by
otieno & Pauke (2010) have shown that African citizens‚Äô response to climate change is hampered by
a fundamental shortage of relevant, useful information for African audiences. Additionally, due to
low literacy levels as in Duba et al. (2001) and high levels of poverty in these communities, climate
information is largely not easily accessible even in its simplest form through TV (Huho, 2015).
Most analysis and Ô¨Åndings published and accessible through the internet are in English and a few
major western and Asian languages according to the Bank (2014) and that makes the information not
easily understood by these communities even if there was wide coverage of the internet. Finally, the
indigenous knowledge systems that these communities relied upon to understand weather patterns
like other parts of Africa are largely unpredictable due to global warming (Nyahunda & Tirivangasi,
2019). There is ample evidence that reveals that Africa and other developing countries face more
challenges from climate change because of poor adaptation mechanisms in place (Enete & Achike,
2008); (Jagtap, 2007); (Nwafor, 2007). As a result of all the effects of global warming Nyahunda &
Tirivangasi (2019), there is an urgent need to bridge the gap in climate information.
5 A PPLICATIONS OF ML TOLOW RESOURCE LANGUAGES
Low resource languages lack elaborate monolingual or parallel corpus that can be used to build NLP
applications(Jiatao Gu, 2018). Generation of a corpus for low resource languages is an intensive
human effort that would require the availability of Ô¨Çuent bilinguals or expert translators (Ambati,
2012), (Settles & Craven, 2008). ML techniques like AL with improvements such as Neural Ma-
chine Translation(NMT) and TL have been proven as applications to Machine Translations for Low
resource scenarios. Ambati (2012), Liu et al. (2018), Nguyen & Chiang (2017) and (Ambati, 2012)
deÔ¨Åned AL as a technique of selecting the most informative examples from unlabeled data in order
to reduce human effort as an oracle seeks to annotate the data. AL is extremely relevant for trans-
lating African Languages particularly because of the dearth of labelled data and resources on the
said languages (Garrette et al., 2013), (Fang et al., 2017). Latest improvements on AL Liu et al.
(2018) have demonstrated possibility of getting the highest improvements in the translation qual-
ity of the retrained model. Research by Zoph et al. (2016) has demonstrated that Neural Machine
Translation (NMT) can be used for low-resource languages as well, by introducing more local de-
pendencies and using word alignments to learn sentence reordering during translation. Examples of

NMT as per Zoph et al. (2016) have demonstrated innovative ways such as training a model using
a high-resource language pair, then using it to initialize a child model which is further trained on
a low-resource language pair. Thompson et al. (1999) demonstrated that its applications to Natu-
ral Language Processing tasks has minimized expenses for annotating data. Further advancements
of AL like in Hildebrand et al. (2005) introduced weighting schemes to allow for the sorting of
sentences based on the frequency of unseen n-grams. The output of this was ability select smaller
training corpora that proved the need for much less training data with competitive performance
compared to baseline systems using all available training data. In Gangadharaiah et al. (2009) a
pool-based strategy was used to maximize a measure of expected future improvement, to sample
instances from large parallel corpora.
As per Zoph et al. (2016), TL is the technique where a model is Ô¨Årst trained on a high-resource lan-
guage pair, then the child model‚Äôs parameter values are copied from the parent‚Äôs and are Ô¨Åne-tuned
on its low-resource data. There have been improvements on TL that Zoph et al. (2016) worked on
by Nguyen & Chiang (2017) where the idea was to share the parent and child‚Äôs source vocabularies,
so that when source word embedding are transferred, a word that appears in both vocabularies keeps
its embedding. Nguyen & Chiang (2017) demonstrated that by combining TL with BPE, NMT wit-
nessed improved performance on a low-resource language pair by exploiting its lexical similarity
with another related low-resource language. there was consistent improvement in two Turkic lan-
guages. This would be a technique that could be adopted to Translated closely related languages of
Turkana and Njemps in Northern Kenya. TL has also exhibited successful results in other areas like
Automated Speech recognition (Julius Kunze, 2017).
6 P OTENTIAL IMPACT OF TRANSLATING KNOWLEDGE INTO LOCAL
LANGUAGES
Studies have shown that access to information can help people assess the magnitude of the climate
change challenge, possible options and those feasible within the relevant context (Nyahunda & Tiri-
vangasi, 2019). Access to adaptation techniques and climate information in local languages would
inspire action within these communities and empower them to plant plants and food types that can
survive in prolonged dry conditions. This would lead to food security in Northern Kenya where
approximately 95% of the household income is from agricultural activities (Huho, 2015). Further
Ô¨Åndings Heath (2019) have demonstrated that communities adapt and use techniques to help them
through extended dry seasons and during heavy rain too when they have knowledge and awareness
of climate change. Adaptation initiatives that build on local knowledge most of the time commu-
nicated by locals in their local languages and integrate scientiÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åndings have a higher chance of
leading to sustained and effective adaptation (Gina Ziervogel & Scodanibbio, 2016). This would
additionally make it easy for collaboration between scientists, policy makers and other experts to
understand and appreciate the challenges locals are facing and as a result reÔ¨Åne their approaches
and the solutions they would be working on. Ability to automate translation of information to lo-
cal languages and vice versa would also empower people who work with these vulnerable groups,
such as extension ofÔ¨Åcers, empowerment programmes like this UNFCCC (2020), local and national
governments, and Nongovernmental Organisations(NGO) practitioners.
7 C ONCLUSION
Climate change is already wreaking havoc in arid and semi arid areas of Northern Kenya. These
communities are vulnerable due to their direct dependency on the natural resources being affected.
I hope that our proposal has demonstrated a gap that exist in climate change adaptation information
for Pastoral communities such as those in Northern Kenya and other parts of Africa that can be ad-
dressed through the applications of ML. As AL, TL and NMT continue to improve as techniques for
Machine Translation, there is urgent need to apply them to translate key climate change adaptation
information from Western and major Asian languages to local Northern Kenya languages and equip
these communities with requisite knowledge to adapt as their normal order of natural environments
continue to be disrupted by global warming.
