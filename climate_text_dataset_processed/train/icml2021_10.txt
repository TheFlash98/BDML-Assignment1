ABSTRACT  
Dengue  fever is one of the most common and rapidly spreading arboviral diseases in the world, with major public health and 
economic consequences  in tropical  and sub -tropical regions.  Countries such as Peru, 17.143 cases of dengue were reported 
in 2019 , where 81.4%  of cases concentrated in five of the 25 department s. When predicting infectious disease outbreaks, it 
is crucial to model the long -term dependency in time series data. However, this is challenging when performed on a 
countrywide level since dengue incidence varies across administrative areas. Therefore, this study develop ed and appl ied a 
climate -based ensemble model using  multiple machine lea rning (ML) approaches  to forecast dengue incidence rate  (DIR) by 
department . The ensemble combined the outputs from Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and 
Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) methods  to predict DIR one month ahead for each department in Peru . Monthly dengue 
cases stratified by Peruvian departments were analysed in conjunction with associat ed demographic, geographic , and 
satellite -based meteorological data for the period  January 2010 –December 2019. The results d emonstrated that the ensemble 
model was able to forecast  DIR in low -transmission departments, while the model was less able to detect sudden DIR pea ks 
in some  departments.  Air temperature  and wind  components demonstra ted to be the significant predictors for DIR prediction s. 
This dengue forecast model is timely and can help local gove rnments to implement effective control measures and mitigate 
the effects of the disease.  This study advances the state -of-the-art of climate services for the public health sector, by informing 
what are the key climate factors responsible for triggering dengue transmission. Finally, this project sum marises how 
important it is to perform collaborative work with complementary expertise from intergovernmental organizations and public 
health universities to advance knowledge and address societal challenges.  
1. Introduction   
Dengue is a mosquito -borne v iral infection mostly found in urban and peri-urban areas located in warm and tropical climate 
regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the global burden of dengue increased eight -fold over the last 
two decades1. This increase has been  partly attributed to globalisat ion, climate change  and urbanisation, but can also be  
explained by the improvement in local policies to record and report dengue cases to national (Ministry of Health) and 
international (WHO) related agencies1. However, most dengue infections are asymptomatic cases or misdiagnosed as other 
febrile illnesses, resulting in under -reporting2. Peru is a Latin American country particularly affected by dengue and according 
to the epide miological alerts issued by the Peruvian Ministry of Health, all four dengue serotypes (DENV 1 -4) are in 
circulation3,4. In 2019, 17 .143 cases of dengue (37 deaths) were reported in Peru, representing a 243% increase compared with 
20185. The dengue incidence rate  (DIR) by age group was  reported as 34.18% for children and adolescents  (0-17 years ol d), 
24.88%  for adults betw een 18 and 29-year-olds, 34.60%  for 30 to 59 -year-olds, and 6.68%  adults over 60 -years -old (6.68%)5. 
Since dengue is a climate -sensitive disease, temperature and rainfall variations influence  the magnitude and seasonality of 
dengue transmission6,7. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for dengue, or a national mass dengue testing campaign 
to limit dengue transmission8. Therefore, determining the association between weather patterns and the surge of dengue cases 
is an important policy measure for an early response to future outbreaks.   
 In recent years, the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques to perform Earth Observation (EO) classification and 
regression tasks9,10 have substantially increased thanks to their ability to model any kind of predictor(s) -response association 
and to appropriately capture  complex spatio -temporal relationships11. Several studies in the literature implemented different 
regression methods to forecast dengue cases acros s the globe12–16, and a few used a single machine learning (ML) architecture15–
17 but none explored an ensemble model of multiple -ML approaches. The importance of exploring an ensemble multiple -ML 
models  is because the dengue incidence rate (DIR) varies wi dely across different national administrative areas. Therefore, it 
becomes a difficult task for a single -ML model to fully capture the countrywide behaviour. For example, Figure A1  (in the 
Appendix)  displays the DIR over 25 Peruvian departments. There is high DIR heterogene ity across the country, demonstrating 
departments with a typically low ( e.g., Tacna and Moquegua), seasonal (e.g. Lambayeque and La Libertad), or year-round 
dengue incidence (e.g. Madre de Dios and Loreto).    
The novelty of this work is t hreefold: (i) assess  the benefits of new environmental  data from satellite and satellite -based products  
to forecast DIR, (ii) introduce an innovative methodological ensemble approach to predict DIR one month ahead for each  
Peruvian department , and (iii) bring the most recent evidence on  the climate factors that impact  the dengue  transmission in Per u, 
since this study fou nd th e last related publication covering up to the 2010 period4. The ensemble ML forecast model was 
designed, developed, and applied by  the European Space Agency’s scientific team according to the needs described by UNICEF 
Office of Innovations and UNICEF Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office. The outcome of this project is twofold: (i) 
provide a climate -based ML model to forecast D IR in Peru and (ii) develop a reproducible workflow, presented as a cookbook  
(i.e., all processes are explained step -by-step, from data collection to model validation), where UNICEF  in support of national 
governments  can construct, test, validate and implement a working forecast model fo r other dengue -endemic countries.  
2. Data and Methods  
2.1 Study area and dengue data  
Peru is a highly urbanized country situated on the central western coast of South America facing the Pacific Ocean, with a land 
size of about 1.28 million km2. As of 2020, the country accommodates a population of around 32.6 million with about 34.8%, 
54.3% , and 10.9% inhabitants between the age groups 0 -19, 20 -59, and 60 -80+, respectively18. Peru has a diverse geography, 
comprising a western coastal plain, the Andes mountains, and the eastern tropical Amazon rainforest. The climate conditions 
range from moderate temperatures and low precipitation along the coast, heavy rainfall an d high temperatures in the Amazon, 
and temperate up to cool temperatures in the Andes mountain range.  
This study used the largest Peruvian administrative level (i.e. departments) to group monthly dengue cases f rom 2010 to 2019 
provided by the Department o f Epidemiology of Peru's Ministry of Health19. The number of cases by department was converted 
into dengue incidence rate (DIR) per 100 .000 population . Population data by department for the same period was obtained from 
the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics of Peru (INEI)18.   
2.2 Satellite and satellite -based products  
Three land products were obtained from EO satellites. Firstly, the monthly Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 
was used to indicate  vegetation cover and health20. The NDVI  (MOD09GA Version 621) was calculated  from the Moderate 
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboa rd the Terra satellite. Global Forest Change22 (version 1.8)  was the second 
product explored, retrieved from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites , represent ing the percentage of annual forest loss . Finally, 
a digital elevation product obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission23 (version 4) was used to obtain the mean 
altitude. Seven satellite -based meteorological variables were selected from the ERA 5 global reanalysis dataset provided by 
Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)24. Daily ERA 5 products collected for this study were: 2m height air temperature, 
dewpoint temperature, total precipitation, sea level pressure, surface pr essure, 10m u - and v - components of wind. The grid 
cells from all variables were grouped by department through a geometric intersection tool. Monthly averages  per department 
for each variable were computed f rom January 2010 to December 2019. The minimum and maximum values for 2m  height air 
temperature were also computed , as well as latitude and longitude from each department’s centroid to be used as a spatial proxy. 
All data was obtained from the  Google Earth Engine25 and t he data was manipulated using  Python26. 
2.3 Ensemble machine learning approach  
An ensemble ML approach was developed to forecast DIR one month ahead for each Peruvian department. The two supervised 
ML regression models involved are: (i) a deep learning model, called  LSTM (Long Short -Term Memory)27 and (ii) a tree -based 
ML design, called CatBoost ( Categorical Boosting)28. LSTMs are well known for their ability to process  the input data as a 
sequence of values with  a short - and long -term memory of past inputs, while boosting models like CatBoost are well -known for 
their capacity to deal with learning problems based on heterogeneous features, noisy data, and complex dependencies. Figure 1  
displays the ensemble framew ork, where each ML architecture runs in parallel using the same list of predictors (input X) and  
 the outcome variable (referred here as ground -truth y). The LSTM -based model is composed of three LSTM layers, with 
decreasing size of parameters and thr ee fully connected layers. Each LSTM layer is responsible for the extraction of temporal 
features from the input data, while the fully connected part is responsible for the forecast. The CatBoost model is based on the 
gradient boosting approach, which is e ssentially a process of constructing an ensemble predictor as a combination of weaker 
models (base predictors) by performing gradient descent in a functional space. The proposed ensemble model of multiple -ML 
is based on the late data fusion paradigm, whe re the output of two models is averaged to calculate the final prediction . The 
LSTM and CatBoost were trained using X and y variables from all departments combined. The department ID was included as 
a predictor, enabling the models to provide a unique D IR forecast for each department.    
The full dataset was divided into two sub -datasets: 2010 -2017 training /testing set, referred to here as (𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ,𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ) and 2018 -
2019 validation set, referred as (𝑋𝑣𝑎𝑙,𝑦𝑣𝑎𝑙). Random 𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛  samples were used as feedforward input during the training. The 
internal weights of both models were adjusted based on mean absolute error (MAE) loss and its gradient, used to compare  the 
model output ( i.e., forecasted DIR) with 𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 (i.e. observed  DIR). This study implemented a sliding window method, known 
as a backtesting strategy, where the train -test pair was composed of seven -one months. Therefore, the training/testing sets are 
now fully represented by (𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ,𝑦𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 )∈𝑅(𝑀,𝑁,𝑃),𝑅(𝑀) and the validation set, by (𝑋𝑣𝑎𝑙,𝑦𝑣𝑎𝑙)∈𝑅(𝐾,𝑁,𝑃),𝑅(𝐾); where N is the 
number of months ( i.e. seven ) in the train  of train -test pair, P represents the number of predictors, M, and K are described in 
Equation 1:  
𝑀 𝑜𝑟 𝐾 = 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠  𝑥 (𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡 ℎ𝑠 [𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒  𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 ] − 𝑁) Equation  1 
where, 𝑀depends on the number of departments, the size in months of the training/testing (2010 -2017) set, and N. K depends 
on the number of departments, the size in months of the validation (2018 -2019) set, and N. Once trained,  the LSTM and CatBoost 
algorithms were applied in the validation set, and a measure of performance was generated by computing the root mean squar e 
error (RMSE). To be able to compare the RMSE values between departments, a min -max normalization was applied at the 
department level. In this way, each variable of each department had a maximized dynamics ranging from 0 to 1 . The 
normalization parameter s have been saved to restore later the original range.

3 Results and discussion  
The dataset included 281 .264 dengue cases reported between 2010 and 2019 in 25 departments in Peru (Figure A1 , in the 
Appendix ). The national DIR reported in 2019 was 52 .66 cases per 100 .000 population , which was 90 times  greater  in Madre 
de Dios department and 8, 5, and 2 times  greater  in Tumbes, Loreto, and Ucayali respectively. Madre de Dios is the third -largest 
department in Peru but the  least populated, located almost entirely in the low -lying Amazon rainforest. Excluding Madre de 
Dios, all departments within the top five highest DIR were found in the north, where the minimum T mean does not go below 
17°C (Figure A2). This study explored  the most relevant environmental factors reported in the literature12,29,30 that influence 
dengue transmission. Comparing Figure A1 with Figure A3 showed that high altitude is a clear environmental factor responsible  
for lowering the temperature and consequently reducing DIR in departments located along  the Ande s mountain range. On the 
contrary, department s located in the Amazon rainforest ( i.e., Loreto, Amazonas, San Martin, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios) had 
a high dengue persistence year -round with punctuated  dengue outbreaks during the rai ny season (No vember -April). Therefore, 
this study grouped the departments by three transmission types : (i) low ( e.g., Lima, Apurimac, and Tacna ), (ii) seasonal ( e.g., 
Lambayeque, La Libertad, and Ancash), and (iii) year -round ( e.g., Loreto, San Martin, and Madre de Di os). Chowell  et al.4 also 
grouped Peruvian provinces based on a similar stratification, which they named as jungle, coastal, and mountain regions. They  
aimed to investigate the relationship  between dengue incidence and climate factors during 1994 -2008 and their results showed 
 
 that the jungle region (in this study named as a year-round group) is responsible for multiple dengue introductions into coastal 
areas ( i.e., seasonal group) since their favourable environmental conditions promote constant mosquito breeding sites.  
During the training of the  CatBoost model , the importance of  each predictor  was assessed . This p rocess i denti fied what were 
the most influential variables to predict DIR for each train-test pair . As expected for a forec ast model, t he most important 
variable was DIR from the previous months . Following the DIR, CatBoost model ranked maximu m, minimum, and mean air 
temperature  as well as the wind  components (speed and direction) as the most important variable s. Air temperature  is a well -
know highly ranked variable but wind component has been recently re ported b y the literature31. The high variation in DIR across 
departments motivated thi s study to propose an ensemble -based forecast model since a single -learner would not be able to 
explain this complex heterogeneity in spatial -temporal dynamics of dengue transmission. Table 1  displays the results of LSTM, 
CatBoost, and the ensemble models for three departments that represent each group (full table in the appendix, Table A1). Some 
departments ( e.g., Lambayeque) demonstrated a coherence between LSTM and CatBoost forecast performance; however, the 
benefit in applying a hybrid approach is also t o control overfitting. For example , for Lima, by taking the average of both models' 
results to compute the final forecasted DIR, the ensemble penalised any potential single -model overfit.  Note,  the ensemble did 
not self -adjust to provide g ood performance only to a specific transmission type. Higher RMSE results found in some 
departments (e.g. Tumbes) might be attributable to additional characteristics of dengue transmission that were not accounted in 
the models, entomological surveillance data (geographical distribution and density of the vector population)32 and socio -
economic data (e.g. proportion of dwellings with electric lighting, running water, and hygienic services)2,30. Figure A4 displays 
three plots showing monthly DIR predictions during 2018 -2019 generated by the three models (LSTM, CatBoost, and ensemble) 
and y (ground truth) for three department types (low, seasonal, and endemic). In departments with low DIR, the mode ls were 
able to forecast well without overestimating the dengue incidence. Regarding seasonal and endemic departments, the plots 
showed a good ability to generalize and forecast in many situations.  
This study also faced  some limitations  that must be acknowledged , for example , the very high peaks in specific months for 
Madre de Dios’ DIR were not well captured by the models since these unique outbreak values were  not recorded by any other 
department. This phenomenon was expected since the models did not have sufficient samples to learn this type of dynamics and 
therefore the prediction turned out to be lower. Therefore, future directions for this project are point ing to the exploration of 
weekly data to mitigate high peaks of DIR to improve the modelling performance.

4 Conclusion   
Dengue control and prevention  is a challenging task and must be performed via multiple levels  of coordinated response  (i.e., 
global and local) . This study explored artificial intelligence technologies together with the latest advances from EO satellites 
and satellite -based products to forecast one -month DIR across 25 departments in Peru , chosen as a pilot country for the analysis . 
This study had a truly public health purpose since the project was a cooperation between ESA and UNICEF  with the mission 
to provide  knowledge and  awareness about the impact of climate factors on dengue transmission  that could be bas is for dengue 
prevention and mitigation  policies . The stu dy identified that departments located at higher altitudes kept the weather less 
favourable  to dengue transmission, while proximity to the Amazon rainforest ha s a significant influence to keep some 
departments in an endemic scenario.  The findings a lso showed that there is a strong heterogeneity between departments in Peru; 
therefore, an ensemble -ML approach allows us to capture the transmission dynamic s of dengue across three groups: low, 
seasonal, and year -round transmissions. The  ensemble model demonstrated good accuracy across all groups,  but some 
departments still need information beyond environmental factors , such as entomological surveillance data  and socio -economic 
data to better describe the spatio -temporal DIR patterns. The increase  of temperature due to climate  change will make more 
departments prone to dengue outbreaks33 which might increas e the number of endemic  departments responsible for importing 
cases to the other regions. Therefore, policy measures should strengthen the government response actions to adapt and con trol 
the increasing risk of recurrent outbreaks in new areas .  
Finally, UNICEF's interest is to generate evidence on the correlation between climate change and dengue with the intention of 
influencing the improvement of health ser vices and systems and children's health levels.  Therefor e, the next  steps of this project 
is to subset the methodological approach  to focus on children (i.e., 0-19 years old)  since they  are more vulnerable to suffer from 
severe dengue cases34,35.
