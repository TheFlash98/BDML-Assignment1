ABSTRACT
Maintaining the integrity of solar power plants is a vital component in dealing
with the current climate crisis. This process begins with analysts creating a de-
tailed map of a plant with the coordinates of every solar panel, making it possible
to quickly locate and mitigate potential faulty solar panels. However, this task
is extremely tedious and is not scalable for the ever increasing capacity of so-
lar power across the globe. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end deep learning
framework for detecting individual solar panels using a rotated object detection
architecture. We evaluate our approach on a diverse dataset of solar power plants
collected from across the United States and report a mAP score of 83.3%.

1 I NTRODUCTION
The adoption of renewable energy resources is paramount to fighting the climate change crisis. Over
the last decade renewable energy production has nearly quadrupled, 26% of which is contributed by
solar energy (Rapier, 2020). To ensure that solar power plants are operating at maximum capacity,
inspections utilizing remotely sensed imagery are important in identifying anomalies in damaged
panels. However, with this rapid increase in solar production, it has become increasingly difficult
to scale these inspections efficiently. The initial step in many inspection pipelines is to localize and
georeference individual panels for downstream evaluation tasks. This can be prohibitively time-
consuming for commercial sites, any of which can easily contain tens of thousands of solar panels.
Therefore, this requires an automated approach for detecting and georeferencing individual solar

panels from large scale aerial imagery. To be specific, we wish to create a model that directly predicts
the coordinates of the vertices of each solar panel. We also require the approach to generalize to
images of solar arrays in any orientation across a wide variety of landscapes and environments.
In this paper we introduce a rotated object detection framework for localizing individual solar panels
with arbitrary orientation. We preprocess large-scale orthomosaics into patches which are then pro-
cessed in batches. The predictions are stitched back together and projected from pixel coordinates
to geospatial coordinates, creating an accurate mapping of individual panels in each site. To the best
of our knowledge this is the first study to model solar panel detection as a rotated object detection
problem which allows us to efficiently map individual solar panels in an end-to-end fashion.
2 R ELATED WORK
Most recent works build algorithms for mapping solar panels from aerial or satellite imagery (Yu
et al., 2018; Camilo et al., 2017; Mujtaba & Wani, 2021; Golovko et al., 2021) with the goal of
estimating surface area as a proxy for energy capacity, location density, and other potential insights.
These studies have focused on both small-scale residential solar sites (Zhuang et al., 2020; Khomi-
akov et al., 2022) as well as large-scale commercial sites (Yu et al., 2018). Most approaches use a
two-stage architecture for mapping solar panels from aerial imagery (Hou et al., 2020; Parhar et al.,
2021). The first stage consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for predicting the
probability of the given image containing solar panels or not. The second stage uses a segmentation
model for segmenting out solar panels, contingent upon the first stage predicting the given image
to contain solar panels. While these methods have shown promise in mapping the surface area of
solar arrays across a diverse set of geographies, it remains nontrivial to extract the coordinates of
individual solar panel vertices at scale.
3 M ETHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe the proposed framework’s architecture and the modeling of detection
targets for solar panels.
3.1 R OTATED BOUNDING BOXES
Our key desideratum is to accurately localize individual solar panels, regardless of the orientation of
the panels in the image, and to use this localization to extract the coordinates of the vertices of each
panel. Accordingly, we model the problem as an arbitrarily oriented object detection task where the
ground truth annotations of the solar panels are represented as rotated bounding boxes. Each box is
comprised of the 5-dimensional tuple (x, y, w, h, θ )where (x, y)is the centroid pixel coordinate of
the box, wis the width defined as the shorter side of the box, his the height defined as the longer side
of the box, and θis the rotation angle in degrees required to obtain the rotated box. This bounding
box formulation provides a compact representation which allows us to easily convert to the complete
set of vertex coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)using equation 1 in Appendix B.
3.2 R OTATED ANCHORS
Following R-CNN style object detection architectures, we define a set of proposal anchors as a
strong basis for regression to ground truth rotated bounding boxes. In addition to scale and aspect
ratio, we also provide rotation angle anchors. We specify seven different rotation anchors: −90◦,
−60◦,−30◦,0◦,30◦,60◦, and 90◦. We use standard anchors for scale and aspect ratio parameters
which are defined as [32,64,128,256,512] and [1:2, 1:1, 2:1], respectively. This produces a set of
105 anchors in total (7 rotation anchors, 5 scale anchors, and 3 aspect ratio anchors).
3.3 R OTATED OBJECT DETECTION
We adopt a general Faster R-CNN architecture (Ren et al., 2015) with a CNN backbone, region
proposal network (RPN), classification and box regression head, and a region of interest (RoI) pool-
ing layer. We use the oriented object detection framework from (Ma et al., 2018) in which the

authors present rotated RPN (RRPN) and rotated RoI (RRoI) modifications. The RRPN performs
two functions: it produces rotated bounding box proposals from the specified box anchors defined
in Section 3.1 and regresses the box proposals to accurately localize panel instances for each feature
map. From the RRPN, the proposals and feature maps are fed into the RRoI pooling layer which
projects the arbitrarily oriented proposals onto each feature map and subsequently performs a max
pooling operation. The pooled features from the RRoI layer are fed into a classification head and
a box regression head which produce class labels, class scores, and box coordinates for each solar
panel instance. The architecture can be seen in Figure. 1.
4 E XPERIMENTS
4.1 D ATASET
To train the model, we create a diverse dataset of aerial imagery from various locations across North
America. Figure 3 in Appendix A shows the exact locations where the data is collected. The dataset
consists of 121 high-resolution stitched orthomosacis of large-scale solar farms captured using a
fixed-wing aircraft with an RGB camera at approximately 2.5cm ground sample distance (GSD).
4.2 D ATASET PREPROCESSING
We randomly split the 121 orthomosaics into train, validation, and test sets using an approximate
split ratio of 80/10/10. We then preprocess each orthomosaic into 512x512 patches. Annotating
large scale orthomosaics is time consuming and expensive. Additionally, since visual features of
solar panels do not vary in comparison to natural images, we find it to be redundant to fully annotate
and train on all patches from each site. Consequently, we randomly sample 10 unique foreground
patches containing solar panels from each orthomosaic for annotating. We additionally sample 5
unique background patches from each orthomosaic to increase model precision on images of solar
arrays with substantial portions of background information. We find that with proper augmentation,
described in Appendix B.3, we achieve better results with a sampled dataset from a larger set of
orthomosaics than we do with a smaller set of fully annotated orthomosaics. Finally, to test the
efficacy of the proposed solar panel mapping framework, we create complete georeferenced maps
of the 10 test orthomosaics containing the geospatial coordinates of the vertices of every solar panel.
The spread of all three of our datasets is depicted in Table 2 in Appendix A.

4.3 M ETRICS
To evaluate our model, we report mean average precision (mAP) and mean average recall (mAR)
as our primary performance metrics. We also report mAP and mAR with an IoU threshold of 0.75,
notated as mAP 75and mAR 75, respectively. This is because we are interested in the performance of
the model at high IoU thresholds as a proxy for evaluating how tight the localizations are.
4.4 R ESULTS
We fine-tune the model using several different combinations of ResNet backbone networks, all of
which are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009):
• C4: A conv4 backbone with a conv5 head as described in the original Faster R-CNN paper
(Ren et al., 2015).
• DC5: A conv5 backbone with dilations in the conv5 layer and fully connected layers in the
box regression head (Dai et al., 2017).
• FPN: A feature pyramid network backbone with fully connected layers in the box regres-
sion head (Lin et al., 2017).
We run an ablation study to investigate the effects of the choice of backbone on model performance.
We don’t run any hyperparameter tuning to keep things fair and we use the same hyperparameters
for every model, with the exception that we reduce the batch size for deformable convnet backbones
which require more memory during processing. The ResNet-50-FPN network comfortably achieves
the best results on the validation set and comparable results on the test set.
4.5 D ISCUSSION
The growth in cumulative solar capacity has made it difficult to scale up the inspection and main-
tenance of these valuable assets. In 2022, we estimate that 3.5 GW of potential solar power was
lost due to faulty solar panels. By automating the initial mapping phase of the inspection process,
we estimate that analysts will have a 43% increase in efficiency. This increase in analyst efficiency
decreases the time that faulty solar panels are losing potential power. Finally, we estimate that our
increase in inspection efficiency will lead to a potential retention of 1.4 GW of solar power.
5 C ONCLUSION
In this paper we present a novel rotated object detection framework for end-to-end solar panel detec-
tion and mapping. With our framework, we can directly predict the coordinates of individual solar
panels and project them from image space back to geographical space. We believe that this ability
to automatically map the coordinates of every solar panel in each array will provide the efficiency
required to monitor the overall health of large-scale sites and help continue the rapid growth of the
solar power capacity worldwide.

During training we randomly augment the images and bounding boxes using the following methods:
• Random Rotation described in Ma et al. (2018) with probability p= 0.5
• Color Jitter with brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue factors of σ= 0.1and probability
p= 0.25
• Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) Zuiderveld (1994) with ker-
nel size k= 8and probability p= 0.01
• Random Blur with kernel size k∈[3..7]and probability p= 0.01
We find random rotation augmentation to be critical for accurate orientation prediction.
