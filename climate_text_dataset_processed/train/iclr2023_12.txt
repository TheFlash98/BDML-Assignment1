ABSTRACT
The level of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in our atmosphere is rapidly rising and is pro-
jected to double today‚Äòs levels to reach 1,000 ppm by 2100 under certain scenar-
ios, primarily driven by anthropogenic sources. Technology that can capture CO 2
from anthropogenic sources, remove from atmosphere and sequester it at the gi-
gaton scale by 2050 is required stop and reverse the impact of climate change.
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been a promising technology in various
applications including gas separation as well as CO 2capture from point-source
Ô¨Çue gases or removal from the atmosphere. MOFs offer unmatched surface area
through their highly porous crystalline structure and MOF technology has poten-
tial to become a leading adsorption-based CO 2separation technology providing
high surface area, structure stability and chemical tunability. Due to its complex
structure, MOF crystal structure (atoms and bonds) cannot be easily represented
in tabular format for machine learning (ML) applications whereas graph neural
networks (GNN) have already been explored in representation of simpler chem-
ical molecules. In addition to difÔ¨Åculty in MOF data representation, an inÔ¨Ånite
number of combinations can be created for MOF crystals, which makes ML ap-
plications more suitable to alleviate dependency on subject matter experts (SME)
than conventional computational methods. In this work, we propose training of
GNNs in variational autoencoder (V AE) setting to create an end-to-end workÔ¨Çow
for the generation of new MOF crystal structures directly from the data within
the crystallographic information Ô¨Åles (CIFs) and conditioned by additional CO 2
performance values.
1 N EED FOR CARBON CAPTURE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION
Limiting global warming to 1.5C implies that net anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions
worldwide decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reache net-zero by 2050 (IPCC,
2018). To achieve this target while ensuring a smooth energy transition, we need to reduce the
emissions from hard-to-abate industrial CO 2sources such as power, cement, steel, and chemical
plants. In this journey, CO 2capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) will play a vital role by
capturing at the sources and permanently storing in the subsurface. However, this ambitious goal
requires global deployment of CO 2capture plants at a very large scale - increasing capture capacity
from 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) today to 5635 mtpa by 2050 (Global CCS Institute, 2020).
In the capture process, we must separate CO 2molecules from other gases that are present in the
gas stream coming out of a power plant or an industrial facility. Several well-established separation
technologies exist to remove CO 2from various emission sources, with solvent-based absorption
technology being the most mature and deployed at industrial scale (Leung et al., 2018). The capture
processes operating with aqueous amine (e.g., monoethanolamine) solvents, however, are plagued
by high energy cost associated with solvent regeneration. The corrosive nature of amine solvents
and emission of toxic amines with the treated gas are also challenges that need attention (Oko et al.,
2017). To address these challenges, researchers have developed alternative solvents, such as non-
aqueous and bi-phasic solvents. Apart from the solvent performance, the large size of absorption
and desorption columns required in solvent-based capture plants imposes high capital expenditure.
As a result, CO 2separation techniques using solid sorbents, membranes, and cryogenics have been
1Published as a workshop paper at ‚ÄùTackling Climate Change with Machine Learning‚Äù, ICLR 2023
developed and tested at the laboratory scale and pilot scale (Abanades et al., 2015). Extensive
research and development activities have been ongoing for the last two to three decades to increase
the technical maturity of these nascent technologies and to reduce the cost of capture at industrial
scale. Despite these efforts, there is a strong demand for new material development to improve the
CO 2capture capacity and selectivity over other gases and to reduce the regeneration energy need.
2 M ETAL -ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOF) FOR CO2 C APTURE
There is an urgent need to develop new materials for CO 2capture with an objective to lower the
cost of CO 2capture and the energy penalty. Different classes of materials are being explored for
this application for their CO 2selectivity, afÔ¨Ånity towards CO 2and capture density. MOFs come
across as promising candidates due to their large surface area, Ô¨Çexibility in tuning surface properties
for selectivity, tunable porous structure and, more importantly, scalability for industrial use. MOFs
can offer efÔ¨Åcient CO 2adsorption in a highly porous crystalline structure, which can also provide
stability and tunability (Lu et al., 2022). Such crystals combine metal ions to organic ligands through
coordinate covalent bonds, which are also called structural building units (SBUs). MOFs can be
highly tuned through functionalization of SBUs, optimization of linkers and pore spacing to alter
the physical and chemical properties. The ability of MOFs to make hybrid structures with other
materials and their well-deÔ¨Åned structure enable subject matter experts (SMEs) to better understand
MOF-based catalysts (Ding et al., 2019). Some of the properties of interest in our application are
CO 2adsorption capacity and selectivity in gas mixtures of CO 2, methane (CH 4), H 2O or N 2.
Figure 1 presents a well-studied MOF to date, Zn 4O(BDC) 3(Li et al., 1999). In this family of
materials, it is clearly demonstrated that the pore size and functionalities can be Ô¨Ånely tuned with
the choice of a linker molecule. Here, blue tetrahedra represent ZnO 4while red and grey spheres
represent oxygen (O) and carbon (C) atoms, respectively.
Figure 1: A portion of the Zn 4O(BDC) 3MOF (Li et al., 1999). Blue tetrahedra represent ZnO 4
while red and grey spheres represent oxygen (O) and carbon (C) atoms, respectively.
However, to-date, only a small number of MOFs have been experimentally studied and consider-
ing the variability in impurities especially for the post-combustion capture process with increased
amounts of water in the stream, there is an urgent need to explore and understand impact on overall
capture process. More importantly, there is a greater need to understand the role of impurities on
the long-term stability of the material and energy requirement for the regeneration of the material.
These requirements point to the need for a faster and reliable way to design and screen MOFs for
post-combustion capture process.
Properties of each bond and atom and details of the crystal structure can be presented in the ac-
companying crystallographic information Ô¨Åle (CIF), as seen in Figure 1, which we will use directly
to construct the graph models for each MOF crystal. Past machine-learning (ML) work on MOFs
heavily depended on the SME interpretation of the properties through feature engineering with geo-
metric, chemical and energy-based descriptors of MOFs, which is extremely time consuming.

3 G RAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (GNN)
Social-networks, citation networks, molecules even images and text can be represented with graphs,
and GNNs are applied to supervised or unsupervised graph-level, node-level or edge-level tasks as
well as generative or adversarial tasks (Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2021). GNNs were introduced over
a decade ago (Scarselli et al., 2009) and have already been applied to various graph data including
trafÔ¨Åc prediction (Derrow-Pinion et al., 2021), physics simulations (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020),
recommender systems (Wu et al., 2022), social network classiÔ¨Åcation (Kipf et al., 2017) as well as
molecule classiÔ¨Åcation (Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2019) and drug discovery (You et al., 2018) tasks.
While some ML work focuses on sub-graph properties on very large graphs where discovering node
relationships with ML is very impactful, some graphs are small enough so that full-graph task can
be achieved. Most relevant literature to our proposal is along the lines of molecule prediction or
drug discovery tasks where atoms in molecules can be represented as nodes and bonds as edges
in undirected graphs as illustrated in (Coley et al., 2018) for prediction of chemical reactivity or
material property prediction in (Choudhary et al., 2021). In the computational material screening for
CO 2separation literature (Bayraktar, 2022), GNNs are utilized in regression and classiÔ¨Åcation tasks
to predict MOFs‚Äò various CO 2adsorption properties in (Choudhary et al., 2022), and (Cong et al.,
2022) replacing the computationally expensive grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations
to simplify high-performance MOF screening. For drug and molecule discovery, there have been a
handful of graph-based variational autoencoder (V AE) works applied to generation of Ô¨Åxed sized or
small molecules (Simonovsky et al., 2018), (Liu et al., 2018), (Jin et al., 2018), but there have not
been any works on GNN-based V AE for generation of MOFs for the application of CO 2capture.
4 GNN-G ENERATED MOF S FOR CARBON CAPTURE
In this work, we are proposing to train end-to-end GNN-V AE models directly from the existing CIF
content and related GCMC data (such as CO 2working capacity and CO 2/N2selectivity) for over
340,000 MOFs (Lu et al., 2022) eliminating the need for geometric or chemical descriptors hand-
designed by SMEs. Unlike the past MOF screening literature, GNN-V AE models would eliminate
the need for expensive GCMC simulations to assess performance of potential MOF designs and
could directly generate high-performing MOFs at inference. Generative models need to overcome
limitations with following properties: (i) the crystal (and graph) size can be arbitrary, (ii) training
should not suffer from quadratic complexity to enable large crystal representations and (iii) MOF
generation should be diverse and not dependent on a small set of subgraphs.
Figure 2: Proposed end-to-end GNN-based MOF generation workÔ¨Çow utilizing CIFs directly.
Simple chemical molecules as well as MOF crystals can be represented as undirected graphs, where
atoms are nodes and bonds are the edges. Due to the undirected nature, a symmetric adjacency ma-
trix results representing the nodes. Edges will represent the bond information available in the CIFs
such as bond type and bond distance. We propose to explore graph convolutional neural networks
(Coley et al., 2018) and graph attention networks (Velickovic et al., 2017) to identify most efÔ¨Åcient
GNN architecture that can generate diverse sets of new MOF crystals while addressing aforemen-
tioned limitations. The proposed training workÔ¨Çow is illustrated in Figure 2, where crystal structures
in CIF Ô¨Åles are converted to graph representation, and an encoder/decoder model is trained on that
data. Additional information such as crystal unit dimensions and angles, crystal system type and
related CO 2adsorption performance can be utilized as conditioning on the latent space.
