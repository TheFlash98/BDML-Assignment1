Abstract
Climate and poverty are intrinsically related: regions with extreme temperatures,
large temperature variability, and recurring extreme weather events tend to be
ranked among the poorest and most vulnerable to climate change. Nevertheless,
there currently is no established method to directly estimate the impact of specific
climate variables on poverty and to identify geographical regions at high risk of
being negatively affected by climate change. In this work, we propose a new
approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to estimate the effect of
climate and remote sensing variables on poverty indicators measuring Education,
Health, Living Standards, and Income. Furthermore, we use the trained models
and perturbation analyses to identify the geographical regions most vulnerable to
the potential variations in climate variables.
1 Introduction
Climate change, a global exigency, affects not just the natural world but has profound socio-economic
implications as well [ 1]. From altering agricultural outputs [ 2] to affecting public health [ 3,4], the
tentacles of climate change reach far and wide. One such significant socio-economic metric affected
by these changes is poverty [ 5,6]. Understanding this relationship and its extent can provide a
foundation for creating informed policies that holistically address both the environment and socio-
economic health [ 7]. By identifying areas with higher risk of falling into poverty from climate change
we hope that we will help raise awareness and allow for preventative measures to be implemented. [ 8]
While numerous studies have delved into poverty analysis using various indicators and surveys, few
have leveraged extensive open climate data exclusively without any localized datasets[ 9,10,11,12].
This paucity becomes even more pronounced when one considers the application of methodologies
like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for such an analysis. Furthermore, even though many works
have explored the usage of machine learning models to predict poverty [ 13,14,15,16] few have
attempted to clarify the relationships between the features used and the predicted poverty indexes.
Our research fills this gap by systematically analyzing the relationship between open climate data
and poverty indexes — leveraging state-of-the-art models, including GNNs and ensemble models,
and explainability methods, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [17].

In the quest to understand and predict poverty, traditional methodologies have predominantly leaned
on socio-economic surveys, census data, and labor-intensive ground truthing processes [ 9,10,11,12].
While providing a detailed picture, these methods are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and can
sometimes lag behind rapidly changing realities, particularly in developing nations where socio-
economic conditions can swiftly fluctuate [18, 19, 20].
With the advent of data-driven methodologies, recent years have seen a surge in the application
of machine learning models to predict poverty. Such endeavors often utilize private or localized
datasets as features ranging from household surveys to mobile phone data [ 14,15,16]. However,
while powerful, many of these datasets are region-specific, limiting their scalability across borders.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence in various domains, from molecular
chemistry [ 21] and social network analysis [ 22] to recommendation systems [ 23] and physical
systems [ 24]. Their adaptability to dynamic regions of interest, size invariance, and scalability make
them particularly suited for complex tasks [ 25,26,27,28] where the data have an inherent graph
structure [23, 29].
Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a critical area of research, particularly in applications where
understanding the decision-making process is as important as the decision itself [ 30,31,32,33].
Methods like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) [ 34] and SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) [ 17] have been employed to interpret complex models, providing insights into
feature importance and decision rationale [ 35,36,37,38]. In the context of poverty prediction and
climate factors, explainability can offer valuable insights into which variables are most influential,
thereby guiding policy interventions more effectively [7, 39, 40, 41].
One paradigm within XAI that has shown promise is perturbation-based methods. These methods
investigate the properties of machine learning models by altering the input in various ways—such as
occluding part of an image or replacing a word in a sentence—and observing the resulting changes in
the model’s output [ 42]. Perturbation-based methods have been applied across various data types,
including images [ 43,44], videos [ 45,46], and natural language [ 47]. These methods offer several
advantages: they provide an intuitive way to explore black-box models, allow for dynamic analysis,
and are generally applicable to any models [42, 48].

3 Methodology
3.1 Data
The primary dataset used in this study consists of open-access climate data obtained from various
sources, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Copernicus Sentinel-2, MODIS, and more. The
dataset includes variables such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed from the
year 2022. Additionally, poverty indexes for Thailand at a sub-district level were obtained from
TP-MAP (Thai People Map & Analytics Platform) [ 49]. Out of 5 poverty indexes, we focus
our experiments on 4 of them: Education, Living Standards, Health, and Income. All data were
preprocessed to handle missing values, and to normalize the scales. Feature selection was performed
using correlation analysis to remove multi-collinear variables — often found to be detrimental to
model performance [ 50,51,52]. A complete list and explanation of the features used, TP-MAP
Dataset, and data preprocessing steps can be found in the Appendices A.1, A.2, and A.3, respectively.
3.2 Models
We leveraged a two-stage pipeline with two tasks: classification and regression. The first-stage
model classifies whether or not each sub-district is affected by poverty, while the second-stage model
performs regression to predict the degree to which poverty has affected the sub-district. We train
all classification models using Stratified KFold cross-validation, and train all regression models
using KFold cross-validation. Classification model performance is evaluated using Accuracy and
F1. Regression model performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared
2Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Due to the nature of our data, we considered
Ensemble Models (often state-of-the-art on tabular data) and GNN models (often state-of-the-art on
graph data).
To establish a baseline for comparison, we incorporated a "dummy model" in our study. This
model uses simple heuristics: for classification, it predicts the most common class (mode) from
the training dataset, and for regression, it predicts the average (mean) of the training labels. This
model’s predictions are uniform, ignoring input features, providing a basic benchmark against our
more sophisticated models.
3.2.1 Ensemble Models
We utilize ensemble models due to their effectiveness with tabular data, crucial for analyzing
our climate and poverty indices. These models handle diverse data types well, capture complex
relationships, and offer straightforward interpretability through feature importance scores. Their
inclusion provides a robust baseline for comparison, enriching our understanding of the key drivers of
poverty in the context of climate change and validating the effectiveness of our modeling approach.
To build strong ensemble models, we considered popular ensemble models including LightGBM [ 53],
XGBoost [ 54], CatBoost [ 55], and Random Forest [ 56], and other traditional baselines including
Support Vector Machines (SVM) [ 57], and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) [ 58]. We then tuned the
hyper-parameters of the top 5 models and combined them in a stacking and voting ensemble.
3.2.2 Graph Neural Networks
The selection of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for our study is driven by their strong alignment with
the challenges of analyzing climate change impacts on poverty. GNNs are particularly adept at spatial
data representation, crucial for our geographically-oriented dataset [ 23,29]. They excel in relational
learning, enabling them to capture complex interdependencies between regions [ 25,26,27,28],
a key aspect in understanding how climate factors influence poverty. Their scalability is essential
given the extensive data involved in our research. This combination of features makes GNNs an ideal
choice for effectively analyzing and predicting the multifaceted impacts of climate change on poverty.
We tested various GNN architectures such as Graph Convolution Network (GCN), GraphSAGE,
Graph Attention Network (GAT), ChebNet, and Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN). Nodes in the
graph represent geographical regions in Thailand with attributes extracted from the climate dataset,
while edges are unweighted. We tuned each architecture’s hyper-parameters extensively for both tasks:
aggregation functions, number of hidden layers, activation functions, dropout rates, initialization
function, and others. For a comprehensive list of tuned hyper-parameters please see Appendix A.4.
3.3 Model Explanation
To study the relationship between climate variables and poverty indices for tabular models, we apply
the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [ 17] method to the best-performing models. This method
allows us to estimate the magnitude and direction of the effect of each feature on each considered
target poverty index.
For GNNs, we utilize GNNExplainer [ 59]. This tool effecively identifies critical node features
pertaining to the GNN’s prediction. Its application is vital in our context, as it not only demystifies
the decision-making process of GNNs but also ensures that our model’s predictions are based on
meaningful and relevant data patterns. GNNExplainer aids in validating the model’s performance
and informs further model refinements, aligning our study with the demands for transparent and
accountable AI, especially in areas with profound socio-economic and environmental implications.
To identify the sub-districts at the highest risk of being affected by climate change, we employ
a perturbation-based approach. Specifically, we leverage best-performing models to measure the
changes in poverty metrics in response to changes in individual climate factors. For example, we may
increase the temperature values for a particular sub-district and assess how this perturbation affects
the predicted poverty.

4 Results
Classification Models The performance of various models on different dataset targets is summa-
rized in Table 1. For classification tasks, the F1 score and accuracy were used as the evaluation
metrics. Our Graph Neural Network (GNN) model outperformed the best ensemble model across all
dataset targets. Specifically, in the education domain, our GNN model achieved an F1 score of .62
and an accuracy of .80, compared to .52 and .77 for the best ensemble model. Similar trends were
observed in the health, income, and living standards domains, reinforcing the efficacy of our GNN
model for classification tasks.
Regression Models For regression tasks, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) were used as the evaluation metrics. Once again, our GNN model demonstrated
superior performance. In the education domain, the GNN model achieved an MAE of .19and an
RMSE of .24, which are better than the best tabular model’s .21 and .25, respectively. This trend of
outperformance by our GNN model was consistent across all dataset targets.

change. The gray sub-districts are ones where we don’t have the training/testing data for.
45 Discussion
5.1 Model Explanation
To further understand the inner workings of our models, we employed SHAP and GNNExplainer
for the tabular and GNN model respectively, to interpret their predictions. The plots revealed that
certain features had a more significant impact on the model’s decision-making process than others.
For instance, NO2 levels, Aerosol Optical Thickness, and evaporation are most influential features
for predicting poverty rates. Furthermore, it is evident that temperatures, pollution (temperature of
O3), and crops also play a big role. The plots and more details are available in Appendix A.5.
5.1.1 Identifying Vulnerable Sub-districts through Perturbation Analysis
By introducing small perturbations to the data and observing the changes in the model’s predictions,
we were able to pinpoint rows that were particularly sensitive to changes. Specifically, we identified
that the most sensitive areas are among the North and Northwest parts of Thailand. Identifying such
vulnerable instances is crucial for targeted interventions and resource allocation.
This could be due to the fact that in the mountainous regions of North and Northwest Thailand,
educational access is severely hindered by geographical isolation, difficult terrain, and infrastructural
deficiencies, including sporadic internet and electricity provision [ 60]. The COVID-19 pandemic
has intensified these challenges, disrupting education systems and disproportionately affecting
marginalized communities, with girls and young women at particular risk of educational discontinuity
due to increased domestic responsibilities during the crisis [60].
6 Conclusion
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between climate change
and poverty in Thailand, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques such as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) and ensemble models, along with perturbation analsysis and other XAI methods.
The core achievement of our research is the enhanced understanding it offers of the socio-economic
impacts of climate change, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in policy-making and resource
allocation such as governments and NGOs. By utilizing open climate data and GNN models, our
approach surpasses traditional methods, offering a more dynamic, accurate, and granular analysis
of poverty-stricken areas. This is complemented by the robustness and comprehensive nature of the
predictions made by ensemble models, which together with GNNs, provide a well-rounded analysis
tool.
In conclusion, our research marks a significant step forward in using technology to understand and
address the challenges of climate change on socio-economic conditions. It opens up new avenues
for research and practical application, aiming to create more informed, effective, and equitable
interventions. We hope that our study will not only contribute to academic discourse but also translate
into real-world impact, aiding in the development of resilient communities better equipped to handle
the ramifications of climate change.

A.2 Details on TP-MAP Dataset
Thai People Map and Analytics Platform (TPMAP) [ 49] is a data analytics tool developed by the
Office of National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) and National Electronics
10and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), National Science and Technology Development
Agency (NSTDA), Ministry of Science and Technologies. The platform aims to provide precision
poverty alleviation and improve the quality of life for Thai citizens by integrating data from various
government agencies.
A.2.1 Multidimensional Poverty Index Indicators
TPMAP employs the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) developed by Oxford Poverty & Human
Development Initiative and United Nation Development Programme (UNDP). The MPI uses five
dimensions to identify poverty: healthcare, education, income, living standard, and access to public
services. Below are the indicators used for each dimension:
Table 3: Multidimensional Poverty Index Indicators in TPMAP
Dimension Indicators
Health Care Newborn weight above 2.5 KG
Food consumption meets hygienic standards,
Proper use of medicines,
Regular exercise (3 times a week, 30 minutes each)
Living Standard Safe housing conditions,
Access to drinking water (5 liters/person/day),
Access to clean water for daily use (45 liters/person/day),
House kept tidy and hygienic
Education Proper care for children age 3-5,
Mandatory nine-years education for children age 6-14,
Continuation to higher education levels,
Literacy and basic math skills for age 15-59
Income Proper jobs and income for age 15-59,
Average income per year of individual household members
Access to Public Services Proper care for elders,
Proper care for the disabled
A.3 Data Preprocessing and Splitting
This appendix provides a detailed explanation of the data preprocessing and splitting steps carried
out in this study.
A.3.1 Preprocessing
1.Aggregation: We aggregate our features by taking the mean of each over the temporal axis.
In other words, we take the average of each feature over the whole year.
2.Removal of Multi-colinear Features: Features with a correlation coefficient greater than
0.8 were identified. Among the correlated pairs, the feature deemed less important according
to the best model at that time was removed.
3.Iterative Feature Imputation: Missing features in the dataset were filled using an ensemble
of the best-performing tabular models in an iterative manner.
4.Feature Standardization: All features were transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard
deviation of 1, ensuring that no particular feature dominates the model.
5.Target Variable Transformation: For regression tasks, the target variable underwent two
transformations. First, it was transformed to follow a uniform distribution. Then, its values
were scaled to lie within a 0-1 range.
A.3.2 Data Splitting For Classification and Regression
1.Two-Stage Model: The study employed a two-stage modeling approach, consisting of a
classification model followed by a regression model.
112.Classification: The first stage involved training a classification model to predict whether a
sub-district is affected by poverty or not.
3.Regression: The second stage involved training a regression model, but only on sub-districts
with non-zero poverty indices.

A.5 Feature Importance Plots from SHAP and GNNExplainer
The combined feature importance and SHAP value analyses from the Graph Neural Network (GNN)
classifier and tabular model reveal crucial environmental and socio-economic predictors that influence
poverty in Thailand. Environmental factors such as evaporation_from_vegetation_transpiration and
forecast_albedo emerge as highly influential in the GNN classifier, suggesting a strong link between
natural resource indicators and educational outcomes. The SHAP value analysis complements this
finding, highlighting the varied impacts of stratospheric_NO2_column_number andAOT, indicative
of complex interactions with levels of poverty. Other features, notably evaporation_from_open_water
andLST_Day_1km , display predominantly negative impacts on poverty predictions, hinting at their
associations with more affluent conditions.
These analytical insights unveil the intricate interplay between ecological variables and poverty,
emphasizing the necessity for a nuanced understanding in policy formulation and resource allocation.
The interpretability afforded by SHAP values provides a transparent picture of the contributing factors,
which is crucial for making informed decisions in socio-economic planning. Such detailed analyses
offer a clear pathway for stakeholders to strategically target interventions and for researchers to delve
deeper into the causal dynamics of poverty, ensuring that efforts are both effective and efficiently
directed.
