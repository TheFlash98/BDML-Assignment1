Estimation of Air Pollution with Remote Sensing Data:
Revealing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Space
Linus Scheibenreif1Michael Mommert1Damian Borth1
Abstract
Air pollution is a major driver of climate change.
Anthropogenic emissions from the burning of fos-
sil fuels for transportation and power generation
emit large amounts of problematic air pollutants,
including Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). Despite
the importance of limiting GHG emissions to mit-
igate climate change, detailed information about
the spatial and temporal distribution of GHG and
other air pollutants is difÔ¨Åcult to obtain. Exist-
ing models for surface-level air pollution rely on
extensive land-use datasets which are often lo-
cally restricted and temporally static. This work
proposes a deep learning approach for the pre-
diction of ambient air pollution that only relies
on remote sensing data that is globally available
and frequently updated. Combining optical satel-
lite imagery with satellite-based atmospheric col-
umn density air pollution measurements enables
the scaling of air pollution estimates (in this case
NO2) to high spatial resolution (up to 10m) at
arbitrary locations and adds a temporal compo-
nent to these estimates. The proposed model per-
forms with high accuracy when evaluated against
air quality measurements from ground stations
(mean absolute error <6g=m3). Our results en-
able the identiÔ¨Åcation and temporal monitoring of
major sources of air pollution and GHGs.
1. Introduction
Air pollution and the emission of GHGs is the main cause
of climate change with annual global emission levels still
on the rise (Friedlingstein et al., 2019). In particular, an-
thropogenic GHG emissions from the combustion of fossil
fuels in industrial plants or for transportation are harmful

to the environment and contribute to global warming trends
(Ledley et al., 1999). Besides the primary greenhouse gas,
CO2, the burning of fossil fuels also emits molecules like
NO2and CO, which have been used as proxy for the esti-
mation of CO 2emissions (Berezin et al., 2013). Detailed
information about sources and distribution of air pollutants
within the atmosphere is of high relevance for a number
of applications with climate change impact, including the
compilation of emission inventories (Eggleston et al., 2006),
the design and implementation of pollution limits (Bollen &
Brink, 2014), and the quantiÔ¨Åcation of large anthropogenic
emissions (Liu et al., 2020).
At present, continual data on air pollution concentrations in
the atmosphere are primarily collected through two different
approaches with distinct drawbacks. On the Earth‚Äôs surface,
networks of measurement stations record the concentration
of various chemicals at select locations (Guerreiro et al.,
2014). Such networks are commonly run by environmental
agencies and provide frequent measurements while often
lacking in spatial coverage. This drawback can be partly ad-
dressed by space-borne air pollution monitoring: satellites
equipped with spectrometers measure the abundance of se-
lect molecules in the form of atmospheric column densities
(Gupta et al., 2006). While their position in Earth‚Äôs orbitEstimation of Air Pollution from Remote Sensing Data

locations without air quality stations, providing a means to map air pollution on the surface level to identify sources of air pollution and
GHG emissions (see Fig. A1 for more examples).
allows satellites to frequently map most locations on Earth,
remote sensing spectrometers currently only provide spatial
resolutions in the kilometer range and with little information
about the pollutant‚Äôs vertical distribution. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the
estimation of concentrations near the surface, where these
pollutants originate from, is a non-trivial task (Scheibenreif
et al., 2021). One of the primary anthropogenic air pollu-
tants is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2). Elevated levels of NO 2
harm the vegetation, contribute to acid rain, and act as a
precursor of potent GHGs like Ozone (Montzka et al., 2011).
Additionally, NO 2is jointly emitted with CO 2during the
combustion of fossil fuels at high temperatures, making it
a suitable proxy to identify CO 2emission sources (Kono-
valov et al., 2016; Goldberg et al., 2019). This work lever-
ages a large body of publicly available NO 2concentration
measurements on the ground by the European Environment
Agency‚Äôs1(EEA) network of air quality stations and satellite
measurements from the European Space Agency‚Äôs (ESA)
Copernicus program to investigate the distribution of air
pollutants through a deep learning approach. The results of
this work enable the identiÔ¨Åcation of major sources of GHG
emissions and their temporal monitoring on a global scale.
1eea.europa.eu2. Background
Various prediction and interpolation techniques have been
used to derive detailed information about the spatial dis-
tribution of air-borne pollutants such as GHGs. Typically,
these models are based on point measurements from air
quality monitoring stations that are spatially limited to spe-
ciÔ¨Åc locations. Beyond interpolation with geostatistical
approaches like kriging (Janssen et al., 2008), land-use-
regression (LUR) is commonly applied to incorporate co-
variates such as population density or trafÔ¨Åc data into the
models (see Hoek et al., 2008, for a review). LUR mod-
els often involve variable selection procedures to identify
predictive inputs over large sets of candidate variables, mak-
ing it difÔ¨Åcult to scale to regions not covered by detailed
datasets, even if some air quality measurements are avail-
able. Building on existing work that incorporates satellite
measurements into LUR frameworks (Novotny et al., 2011),
we extend this approach to model air pollution at high spatial
resolution solely from satellite data. Our work is based on
NO2concentration measurements by the EEA. We consider
NO2as pollutant of interest due to its relevance as major
anthropogenic air pollutant and chemical properties that fa-
cilitate its detection from space with high accuracy (opposed
to GHGs like CO 2). Additionally, it is co-emitted with CO 2Estimation of Air Pollution from Remote Sensing Data

in the burning of fossil fuels, which makes it possible to
constrain CO 2emissions from NO 2measurements (Berezin
et al., 2013). To facilitate the identiÔ¨Åcation of air pollutant
sources, which are commonly located on the ground, we
model surface-level concentrations (rather than e.g. atmo-
spheric column densities). The EEA network of air quality
stations provides frequent (mostly hourly) measurements of
NO2concentrations at more than 3,000 locations in Europe.
Additionally, remote sensing data from ESA‚Äôs Sentinel-2
and Sentinel-5P satellites is utilized to model air quality.
Sentinel-2 is a constellation of two satellites carrying the
Multi Spectral Instrument, a spectrometer covering the visi-
ble, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared wavelengths with
imaging resolutions between 10 and 60 meters (Drusch et al.,
2012). Sentinel-2 data is widely used in applications like
land cover classiÔ¨Åcation or crop monitoring (Helber et al.,
2019) but also for the monitoring of GHGs at locations
of interest (e.g., based on the presence of smoke plumes,
Mommert et al., 2020). In our work, globally available and
continually updated Sentinel-2 images replace conventional
LUR predictor variables such as street networks, population
density or vegetation information. The Sentinel-5P satellite
observes trace-gases and aerosols in the atmosphere through
differential optical absorption spectroscopy (Veefkind et al.,
2012). It provides daily global coverage for gases including
NO2, O3, CO or CH 4with a spatial resolution of 53:5km.
We utilize the NO 2tropospheric column density product of
Sentinel-5P to model the temporal variation in surface NO 2
levels.
3. Methods
This work approaches the estimation of air pollution as a
supervised computer vision problem. We collect a dataset
of harmonized remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 and
Sentinel-5P, spatially and temporally aligned with measure-
ments from air quality monitoring stations. The proposed
model is trained on pairs of remote sensing input and air
quality target values (see Fig. 1), which yields a system that
predicts air pollution levels solely from globally availableremote sensing data2.
3.1. Data Processing
We consider the 2018-2020 timespan, historically limited
by the start of the Sentinel-5P nominal mission. NO 2
measurements by EEA air quality stations are Ô¨Åltered to
remove values with insufÔ¨Åcient quality ( validity or
verification value6=1). Besides modelling the en-
tire 2018-2020 timespan, we also investigate the possibility
to estimate NO 2concentrations at quarterly and monthly
frequencies. To that end, the mean of NO 2measurements
for each frequency is used as prediction target. To build
the dataset, we downloaded Sentinel-2 Level-2A data (i.e.
corrected for atmospheric effects and enriched with cloud
masks) with low cloud-coverage at the locations of air qual-
ity stations, containing 12 different bands (band 10 is empty
in the case of Level-2A data). The images were then cropped
to 120120 pixel size (1.21.2 km) centered at the lo-
cation of interest, and all bands were upsampled to 10 m
resolution with bilinear upsampling. Additionally, we visu-
ally inspected the RGB bands of all images to ensure that no
clouds or artifacts are present. Similarly, Sentinel-5P data
over Europe was downloaded for the 2018-2020 timespan
(5449 Level-2 products) and mapped to a common rectangu-
lar grid of 0.050.05(55 km) resolution after remov-
ing invalid measurements ( qavalue<75). The resulting
dataset was averaged at the different temporal frequencies
and 2020 km regions at the locations of air quality stations
were extracted. To facilitate processing despite the coarse
resolution (500lower than Sentinel-2), we linearly inter-
polated the Sentinel-5P data to 10 m resolution and cropped
to 120120 pixel centered at the locations of interest.
3.2. Model Architecture
Our core model for NO 2prediction from imaging data is
based on the ResNet-50 architecture (He et al., 2016) (see
Fig. 1). The input layer is modiÔ¨Åed to accommodate the 12-
band Sentinel-2 input data and the Ô¨Ånal layer is replaced by
2code available at github.com/HSG-AIML/
RemoteSensingNO2EstimationEstimation of Air Pollution from Remote Sensing Data
two dense layers with ReLU activation (named head ) that
map the 2048-dimensional feature vector to a scalar value.
We employ transfer learning by pretraining the model on a
land-cover classiÔ¨Åcation (LCC) task with the BigEarthNet
dataset (Sumbul et al., 2019). After pretraining, the Ô¨Ånal
classiÔ¨Åcation layer is replaced by the head , i.e., only the
trained convolutional backbone of the ResNet is retained.
Intuitively, learned features that are informative for LCC
(e.g., distinguishing industrial areas from forests) will also
be useful when estimating emission proÔ¨Åles of different ar-
eas. To handle additional input data from Sentinel-5P, the
model architecture is extended with a small sub-network,
consisting of two convolutional layers (with 10,15 chan-
nels and kernel sizes 3,5, respectively), each followed by
ReLU activation functions and max-pooling (kernel size 3),
and a Ô¨Ånal linear layer. This sub-network is much smaller
than the ResNet-50 used to process the Sentinel-2 input
stream to reÔ¨Çect the lower native resolution and single band
nature of the Sentinel-5P data. It learns a 128 dimensional
latent vector from the Sentinel-5P input image. To obtain
an NO 2prediction, the latent vectors of both input-streams
are concatenated and again processed by the head with ad-
justed input dimensions (2048+128). All presented models
were trained 10 times with varying seeds, mean-squared-
error loss function and random train/test/validation split of
60:20:20. To limit overÔ¨Åtting, training is stopped once the
loss on the validation set stops decreasing. Additionally,
we employ random Ô¨Çipping and rotation of the inputs as
augmentation during training.
4. Experiments
To assess the predictive power of Sentinel-2 images for air
pollution prediction we initially train a model on Sentinel-2
images as inputs with air quality station measurements as
target. Using only Sentinel-2 images forces the model to
associate features that are apparent in medium-resolution
satellite imagery, like built-up areas, forests or streets, with
representative NO 2levels. Training this model from scratch
leads to a mean-absolute-error (MAE) of 8.06 0.49g=m3
and R2-Score of 0.25 0.05g=m3(see Table 1), presum-
ably limited by the dataset size of only 3,227 images. Fol-
lowing the intuition that LCC shares predictive features
with air pollution prediction, we then investigated a transfer
learning approach by pre-training the ResNet backend on
BigEarthNet (590,326 images with multi-label annotations,
Sumbul et al., 2019). Using the pretrained backend in the
NO2prediction model and Ô¨Åne-tuning on the Sentinel-2 im-
ages at air quality stations, we obtain a signiÔ¨Åcantly better
performance. The MAE drops to 6.62 0.17g=m3with
an R2-Score of 0.45 0.03. This Ô¨Årst result supports our
hypothesis that medium-resolution satellite imagery is valu-
able for the estimation of ambient air pollution. We then
investigated ways of incorporating tropospheric column den-

sity measurements of NO 2from Sentinel-5P into the model
using a second input stream. The additional satellite data
results in a further performance increase with an MAE of
5.920.44 and R2-Score of 0.54 0.04 and allows us to
derive detailed pollution maps for any location of interest
(see Fig. 2). Inclusion of Sentinel-5P data, which is updated
daily, also provides us with a way of modeling temporal
variations in NO 2levels. Aggregating the data at higher fre-
quency signiÔ¨Åcantly increases the number of observations
(from 3.1k to 19.6k quarterly and 59.6k monthly samples),
which enables the model to maintain a performance com-
parable to the static predictions (MAE of 6.24 0.22 and
6.520.15g=m3for quarterly and monthly predictions,
respectively). Similarly, the R2-Scores remain at 0.52 0.05
(quarterly) and 0.51 0.01 (monthly) despite the increase
in prediction frequency. This makes it possible to model
seasonal changes in NO 2concentrations with good accuracy
(see Fig. 3).
5. Conclusion
We present an end-to-end approach for the estimation of
surface NO 2concentrations with deep learning. Utilizing
only remote sensing data as inputs, it is possible to model
arbitrary regions on Earth, independent of the availability
of detailed datasets as commonly used in the prediction
of air pollutant distributions. Qualitative evaluation shows
that our models are robust across most regions of Europe,
except for rare atypical locations that are badly represented
in our dataset, e.g., snowy mountain peaks. In future work,
measurements from air quality networks outside of Europe
can be incorporated into model training to improve model
generalization.
The focus of this work on NO 2allows us to leverage a large
corpus of pollutant measurements from air quality stations
and from space to better localize the sources of air pollutionEstimation of Air Pollution from Remote Sensing Data
and GHG emitters. This information enables an approxi-
mate analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of air
pollutants and GHG emissions alike, providing constraints
that are vital for our effort to reduce GHG emissions and
reaching the net-zero emission target.
