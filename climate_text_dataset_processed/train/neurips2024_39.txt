Abstract
Due to climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events, which
contribute to urban flooding, are expected to increase in many places. These floods
can damage transport infrastructure and disrupt mobility, highlighting the need
for cities to adapt to escalating risks. Reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a
powerful tool for uncovering optimal adaptation strategies, determining how and
where to deploy adaptation measures effectively, even under significant uncertainty.
In this study, we leverage RL to identify the most effective timing and locations
for implementing measures, aiming to reduce both direct and indirect impacts of
flooding. Our framework integrates climate change projections of future rainfall
events and floods, models city-wide motorized trips, and quantifies direct and
indirect impacts on infrastructure and mobility. Preliminary results suggest that
our RL-based approach can significantly enhance decision-making by prioritizing
interventions in specific urban areas and identifying the optimal periods for their
implementation. Our framework is publicly available: https://github.com/

1 Introduction
As climate change continues to impact our world, the frequency and intensity of high impact weather
events are expected to rise [ 1]. In Denmark, extreme rainfall is projected to become more severe and
occur more frequently [ 2]. As rainfall increases, so does the risk of urban pluvial flooding. Floods can
significantly disrupt social and economic activities, including transportation, causing delays and loss
of vehicle control [3]. To effectively address these challenges, cities must enhance their resilience.
In this work, we address the challenge of identifying the most effective adaptation measures to
minimize the impacts of pluvial floods on transportation. Using Copenhagen, Denmark, as our case
study, we frame our problem using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We build an environment
that incorporates current climate projections of rainfall and consequent floods. Concurrently, we
model trips which are disrupted by varying water levels, affecting mobility and transport infrastructure.
To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive framework designed to identify the best adaptation
measures for enhancing transportation resilience to urban floods using such approach.
1.1 Related Work
Urban pluvial flooding occurs when large volumes of water accumulate in streets or roads due to
insufficient drainage and infiltration capacity as a result of heavy precipitation events [ 4]. Transporta-
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2024tion is significantly impacted by such floods, both directly and indirectly [ 5]. These impacts include
road deterioration [5], travel delays and congestion [6, 7], and loss of accessibility [8, 9].
RL has previously been applied to a few aspects of flood management and transportation. For instance,
it has been used to design emergency routing systems [ 10], control urban drainage and stormwater
systems [ 11,12], and study travel behaviors to inform response strategies [ 13]. However, these
applications generally focus on reactive strategies – responding to events as they occur – rather than
proactively determining the best adaptation measures to minimize future flood impacts.
On the other hand, evaluating adaptation measures typically relies on expert knowledge or limited
simulations, assessing how these measures can prevent or mitigate the impacts of floods [ 14,15,
16,17]. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive study using reinforcement
learning of how different adaptation measures should be implemented over time to proactively
minimize both the direct and indirect impacts of floods on transportation.
2 Modelling Framework
We frame our approach as an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) that connects: 1) a rainfall
projection model, 2) a flood model, 3) a transportation model, and 4) a transport infrastructure and
mobility impact model. Figure 1 provides an overview of our IAM framework, which we now detail.

2.1 Rainfall Projection Model
Future daily rainfall statistics under the high RCP8.5 scenario [ 21] were retrieved from the Danish
Meteorological Institute’s Climate Atlas [ 20] for the periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100.
For each time slice, we assumed stationarity and formed the associated cumulative density function
(CDF). Based on the CDF we sampled one heavy rainfall event per year. Urban pluvial flooding is
often caused by intense precipitation of short duration (cloudbursts, from minutes to a few hours),
typically associated with warm and moist conditions. For simplicity and as proof-of-concept, we
assumed the projected heavy rainfall intensity (amount of precipitation) to be equal to the accumulated
daily rainfall. Jointly with the choice of climate scenario, the resulting CDF is likely to overestimate
the rainfall intensities and therefore represent a worst-case scenario for our periodical estimates.
2.2 Flood Model
After sampling a particular rainfall event (i.e., amount of rainfall), we model the associated urban flood
using SCALGO Live [ 18]. SCALGO Live is a simplified interactive event-based tool for watershed
delineation, and for fast modelling of flood depths and flow direction based on high-resolution digital
terrain data. For Denmark, SCALGO employs the Danish Elevation Model, which is one of the
world’s best national elevation models. It comprises 415 billion point data, which are used to map
height differences for terrains and areas in a 0.4m grid for the entire country [ 22]. The model does
not include a representation of the urban drainage system. We assumed a uniform rainfall event all
over Copenhagen of unspecified duration, i.e., the water accumulates at all locations at once. Water
is further distributed according to the terrain properties and filled any depressions or holes. If the
volume of water exceeded the depression volume, it overflowed and continued downstream. In sum,
the accumulation of heavy precipitation was mapped to water depths all around Copenhagen for
identification of flooded areas.
22.3 Transportation Model
For the transportation component, we used a simplified version of the popular Four Step Model (4SM)
[19], focusing exclusively on road network and motorized trips. We began by dividing Copenhagen
in Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) following the Danish National Transport Model [ 23]. Then, we
generated and distributed trips following the distribution of trips in Copenhagen [ 24], which were
aggregated within each TAZ to map the supply and demand for each zone. In essence, this distribution
reflects the underlying travel demand. Supply and demand distribution marginals were assigned
used an iterative proportional fitting procedure [ 25] with distance as a travel impedance. Lastly,
we mapped routes between TAZs. TAZs’ centroids were defined as nodes and edges were created
between neighboring TAZs. Paths between origin and destination TAZs were then defined as the
shortest travel time paths for each trip, which can be found using Dijkstra’s algorithm [ 26]. We used
this network to route all trips and estimate volumes and travel times.
2.4 Transportation and Mobility Impacts
Finally, we computed transport and mobility impacts as three types of impacts: direct road infrastruc-
ture damage impacts and indirect impacts due to increase travel delays.
Road infrastructure damage: We began by downloading road network data from OpenStreetMap
[27] using osmnx [28] from Copenhagen and computing their total construction costs per road type,
number of lanes, presence of light posts and traffic lights van Ginkel et al. [29]. Damage was then
computed using depth-damage functions [ 29], effectively mapping the percentage of damage on a
road according to the water depth at its location. This damage accounts for reconstruction, repair,
cleaning, and resurfacing works needed to restore roads to their original state. We aggregate direct
impacts as the monetary losses at the i-th TAZ as Ri.
Travel delays: As water levels increase, travel speed is reduced, resulting in travel delays. To account
for these effects we used a depth-disruption function [ 30], mapping decreased vehicle speeds to water
depth. The speed reduction and consequent increased travel times were then modelled as economic
losses using the danish travel delays value of time [31], which we aggregated as Difor each TAZ.
2.5 Reinforcement Learning
Under the current climate uncertainty, we posit to uncover the best adaptation measures that minimize
the impact of flooding events on transportation using RL. RL is a sub-field of machine learning
that uses an agent-based approach to interact with an environment and achieve a certain goal [ 32].
Through training and by maximizing a pre-defined function (reward), the agent learns what is the
best action (adaptation measure) to take. By default, the environment (as defined by the above IAM)
is defined as a Markov Decision Process [33], where each state is independent.
Albeit many adaptation measures can be devised, in this first work, we defined one possible measure:
elevate roads by 1 meter (i.e., increase the minimum water depth needed to affect roads). At each
time step, our RL agent takes an action on a TAZ and and collects information about the state of
Copenhagen (e.g., precipitation event, period of time, direct and indirect impacts per TAZ, water
depths on roads), effectively learning the best set of actions to take over time and space. We defined
the reward function as an overall metric of economic loss, defined as:
R=X
i∈TAZβRRi+βDDi+βAAi (1)
where Ri,Diare as previously defined, Aiis the cost of applying an action (i.e., cost of elevating
roads by 1 meter), and weights β(βR=βD=βA= 1) adjust for different component importances.
3 Preliminary Experiments & Discussion
We setup our IAM using Python, the Gymnasium interface [ 34], Stable-Baseline3 [ 35], and PPO
[36,37]. To showcase the application of our approach, we experiment with a preliminary case study.
We begin by running our experiments in the city center of Copenhagen, consisting of 29 TAZ, and set
the time horizon to 2023–2100. We now present preliminary results for 10 runs with distinct seeds to
allow for different weather projections and increased robustness.

policies. Two time horizons are presented: 2023–2035 coinciding with Copehagen’s current climate
adaptation plan [38] and until 2100. Values represent the mean ± standard deviation across 10 runs.

Figure 2: Costs of floods impacts on transportation and mobility in Copenhagen in 2035. Top row
shows results with random adaptation measures deployed over time and space, while bottom row
shows impacts using optimal adaptations over time. From left to right: direct road infrastructure
impacts, indirect impacts as travel delays, percentage of travel time difference for travel between
TAZ, and where adaptation measures were deployed (red).
Table 1 compares the performance of the trained RL agent against a random agent. The results
demonstrate that our agent consistently outperforms the random policy, achieving significantly better
outcomes overall. By 2035, our agent incurs additional costs but achieves a substantial reduction in
direct and indirect impacts, lowering them by 47%. By 2100, although both policies result in similar
adaptation costs, our agent’s strategic deployment of optimal measures over time leads to significantly
reduced travel delays (by 39%) and impacts (by 45%). Figure 2 illustrates the impacts in 2035 for
a single run. As shown, at this point, our agent has implemented specific adaptation measures in
certain TAZs, resulting in lower road damages and reduced travel delays. This highlights the agent’s
ability to prioritize interventions that would otherwise lead to greater losses.
These results underscore the effectiveness of using RL to identify optimal adaptation measures for
Copenhagen over time, enhancing the city’s ability to address climate change more efficiently. The
proposed IAM introduces a novel framework for accurately simulating future rainfall, subsequent
pluvial urban floods, and their impacts on transportation and mobility. Looking ahead, we suggest
that this approach could be valuable for researchers and authorities in making more efficient and
informed decisions and improving urban resilience.
In future work, we plan to further develop our IAM by extending the rainfall projection model,
and by expanding the case study to encompass the entire city of Copenhagen and its metropolitan
area. This expansion would include additional adaptation measures (e.g., constructing permeable
roads or enhancing road durability), other modes of transport (e.g., cycling and walking), broader
impact categories (e.g., electric vehicle charging infrastructure, public transportation accessibility,
and subjective wellbeing), and comparative analyses (e.g., expert knowledge or participatory design).
Additionally, we aim to enhance our transportation simulation by more accurately modeling supply
and demand dynamics and their fluctuations during flood events, which can lead to trip cancellations
and increased congestion levels [ 3]. Including such enhancements can further refine our IAM, making
it a more comprehensive and practical tool for urban resilience planning in the face of climate change.
