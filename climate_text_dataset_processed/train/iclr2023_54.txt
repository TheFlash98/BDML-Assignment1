ABSTRACT
Climate change is expected to have a dramatic impact on agricultural pro-
duction; however, due to natural complexity, the exact avenues and relative
strengths by which this will happen are still unknown. The development of
accurateforecastingmodelsisthusofgreatimportancetoenablepolicymak-
ers to design effective interventions. To date, most machine learning meth-
ods aimed at tackling this problem lack a consideration of causal structure,
therebymakingthemunreliableforthetypesofcounterfactualanalysisnec-
essary when making policy decisions. Econometrics has developed robust
techniques for estimating cause-effect relations in time-series, specifically
through the use of cointegration analysis and Granger causality. However,
these methods are frequently limited in flexibility, especially in the estima-
tionofnonlinearrelationships.Inthiswork,weproposetointegratethenon-
linear function approximators with the robust causal estimation methods to
ultimately develop an accurate agricultural forecasting model capable of ro-
bustcounterfactualanalysis. Thismethodwouldbeavaluablenewassetfor
government and industrial stakeholders to understand how climate change
impactsagriculturalproduction.
1 INTRODUCTION
FIGURE 1: Annual temperature change and
annualvegetablesyieldinItalyTheclimatesystemisbecomingmoreextreme,with
an increase of heavy precipitation events and long
dry spells [14]. Such drastic changes in weather
events will inevitably have a significant impact on
cropyield.Thepreciseeffectofdifferentclimatevari-
ablesonyieldiscomplicatedduetoknownvariation
among plant types and intricate unknown causal
structures [13, 8, 10]. For instance, a naïve correla-
tional analysis of Figure 1 shows increasing temper-

the estimated rela-
tionsbetweenT&Y.Figure 2 is an illustration of the potential problematic causal graph, de-
picting an unobserved causal effect. If we consider temperature (T),
yield (Y) and a third variable (C) (potentially population or pollution),
it can be the case that C acts causally on both temperature and yield,
thereby confounding initial estimates of how temperature may impact
yield. A mistaken causal estimation would have significant negative im-
pactforpolicydecisions.Indeed,confoundersintheclimatescienceliter-
aturehaveleadtomisleadingcorrelations[28].Thus,accuratelyassessing
the causal effects of climate change on agricultural production is critical for correctly form-
ing climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. In prior work, researchers in econo-
metrics and machine learning have examined the effects of climate change on agriculture

[11, 7, 16, 18, 26, 15, 29]; however these approaches have yet to capture the causal influence
ofenvironmentalandsocioeconomicvariablesonagriculture.
In this work, we propose to couple the econometric techniques of cointegration analysis and
Grangercausalitywithmachinelearning,therebycombiningtherobusteconometricmethods
ofcausaldiscoverywiththenonlinearmodelingcapacityofmachinelearning. Weproposeto
apply this method to assess the effects of climate change on agricultural production, which,
to the best of our knowledge, has not been done before in the literature. The contributionos
of this proposal are: (i) the application of powerful nonlinear causal analysis to a new agri-
culture dataset, and (ii) the improved robustness of these causal methods through the use of
cointegrationanalysis.
2 PRIORWORK
In econometrics, importance is given to the techniques of cointegration and the estimation
of Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) [17, 5] or Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedasticity(GARCH)models[22];however,suchmodelscomewithseveralknownlim-
itations [21]. For example, cointegration tests are not flexible enough to handle nonlinear re-
lations, and in general make use of basic statistical models, thereby lacking a consideration
causalitybydefault[24]. Despitethis,cointegrationmethodsareusefultorobustlyunveilhid-
denrelationsbetweenseeminglyunrelatedvariables.Moreover,suchstatisticalmodelsarere-
liable only if the initial conditions and assumptions of the models do not change. As we are
working with factors in climate system that have been changing over last decades, the initial
conditionshavebeenchangingthroughouttime.Ontheotherhand,machinelearningmodels
arealsousuallynotabletodetectcausalitybetweenvariables. Traditionallymachinelearning
modelsfocusonprediction,butnotoncausalitydetection.
3 APPROACH
Methodology We propose an approach where the econometric tests of cointegration and
Granger causation are coupled with deep autoregressive model (DeepAR) and expanded
through a counterfactual analysis. In causal inference, counterfactual analysis allows one to
uncover cause and effects mechanisms between variables. This is possible because the same
model is estimated first with the original variables and then it is estimated again without in-
cludingthosesamevariables. Thedifferencesinthetwoestimationsallowustoestablishthe
presenceofacausalrelation. DeepAR,Grangercausalityandcounterfacturalanalysishaveal-
readybeenusedincombinationtogether,butwithoutperformingapreliminarycointegration
analysis [6]. We propose to expand the work in [6] by performing cointegration tests before
workingwithGrangercausalityandDeepAR.Thepresenceofcointegrationisessentialfortwo
or more variables to be involved in a Granger causality relation [19]. In absence of cointegra-
tion,therelationbetweenthevariablesmightnotexist.Asafurtherdifferencewiththestudyof

Grangercasualityonlyconfirmsthattheinclusionofavariableimprovestheforecastingofan-

Assuming that climatic variables and crops yield are linearly related is an unrealistic limita-
tion. Forthisreason,inourapproachtheGrangercausalitytestwillnotbeperformedusinga
VectorAutoregressive(VAR)model,asitisstandardpractice,butratheradeepautoregressive

theseasonalityofclimaticphenomenaandpotentiallyclimatechangerelatedtrendsobserved
in the last decades, such a powerful model will be better suited to identify hidden variables
whichcannotbeobservedfromthedata.
Inordertoestablishifclimaticvariablesorsoilhavecausaleffectsovercropsyieldwewilluse
knockoffs[12]. Knockoffsarevariablesthatwillhavethesamedistributionastheoriginalcli-
matic and soil variables, but that will be independent of the model output. This means that
theknockoffsaregeneratedsuchthattheyhavenocausalrelationonthecropsyield. Inorder
to assess causality, the DeepAR model will be estimated both using the original climatic and
soil variables and then by using the knockoff variables. The two DeepAR models will then be
comparedfollowing theprocedures ofthe Grangercausality test: if significantdifferences are
foundbetweenthetwomodelestimations,thenwecanconcludethattheoriginalindependent
variableshaveacausaleffectovercropsyield. Ifnodifferencesaremeasured,thenwecannot
concludethatourclimaticorsoilvariablescauseeffectsovercropsyield.Tovalidatetheabove
procedure, we first propose the use of a synthetic dataset where the causal relations between
the variables are already known. We can then measure the agreement of the causal relations
and strengths estimated from the above procedure with the true causal structure to evaluate
thestrengthoftheapproach.Itwillbethenpossibletoquantitativelymeasuretheincreasedro-

4 LIMITATIONS
Ourproposalhassomelimitations,mainlyrelatedtothedatasettobeused. Themainlimita-
tionisthatagriculturalproductionisnotsolely influencedbyclimate, evenwhenthisplays a
big role. Other phenomena such as technological advancements, production techniques and
shocks provoked by wars just to name a few have a non negligible influence. These variables
are all extremely hard to capture. For this reason, the risk of an incorrect estimation of the
relation between the variables persists. In future work, we may consider the introduction of
instrumental-variablesasamethodtohandlesuchunobservedconfounders[25,23].

thenΠis a full rank matrix and the variables are all linearly independent. In the first and last

To derive the test used for testing the presence of a time-varying cointegration, let’s start by
takingaVectorErrorCorrectionModel(VECM)ofthetype:
∆Yt=ΠT

where t=1,2,..., Tthe totalnumber ofobservations, ΠT

(kxk) matrices; given such a model, the objective of the test is to test the null hypothesis of
timeinvariantcointegration,suchas ΠT

with r ank (ΠT
t)=r<k, againstthealternativehypothesisoftime-varyingcointegration, such

6.3 DEEPAR
Given a target time series zi,1:t0−1=[zi,1,...,zi,t0−2,zi,t0−1]and wanting to estimate its fu-
ture values zi,t0:T=[zi,t0,zi,t0+1,...,zi,T], we need to model the conditional distribution
P(zi,t0:T|zi,1:t0−1,xi,1:T), where xi,1:Tis a time series of covariates assumed to be known at all
time points. Assuming that the model distribution consists of a product of likelihood factors
like
Qθ(zi,t0:T|zi,1:t0−1,xi,1:T)=ΠT
t=t0Qθ(zi,t|zi,1:t−1,xi,1:T)=ΠT
t=t0p(zi,t|θ(hi,t,Θ))(13)
