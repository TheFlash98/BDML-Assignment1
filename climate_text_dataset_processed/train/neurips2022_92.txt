Abstract
Contrails, short for condensation trails, are line-shaped ice clouds produced by
aircraft engine exhaust when they fly through cold and humid air. They generate
a greenhouse effect by absorbing or directing back to Earth approximately 33%
of emitted outgoing longwave radiation[ 1]. They account for over half of the
climate change resulting from aviation activities. Avoiding contrails and adjusting
flight routes could be an inexpensive and effective way to reduce their impact. An
accurate, automated, and reliable detection algorithm is required to develop and
evaluate contrail avoidance strategies. Advancement in contrail detection has been
severely limited due to several factors, primarily due to a lack of quality-labeled
data. Recently, [ 2] proposed a large human-labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset.
Each contrail is carefully labeled with various inputs in various scenes of Landsat-8
satellite imagery. In this work, we benchmark several popular segmentation models
with combinations of different loss functions and encoder backbones. This work
is the first to apply state-of-the-art segmentation techniques to detect contrails in
low-orbit satellite imagery. Our work can also be used as an open benchmark for
contrail segmentation and is available at https://github.com/Kasliwal17/
Contrail_Segmentation .
1 Introduction
Contrails, or vapor trails, usually form when water vapor from the exhaust combines with the low
ambient temperatures in high-altitude regions. These contrails create an additional blanket of clouds,
increasing the heat-trapping effect that directly contributes to global warming. Although some may
be short-lived, they can, in many cases, linger for hours[ 3], which results in new contrails created by
aircraft flying on the same routes, accumulating and forming a ’contrail cirrus’[ 4][5], which worsens
the heat-trapping effect. As a result, contrails have become a new cause of alarm for climate change

industry[6].
An effective solution that can reduce the effect of contrails is to avoid the regions of the atmosphere
that are cold and humid enough to create contrails[ 7] and to adjust flight routes and slight changes
in flight altitudes[ 8] to reduce the air traffic in such regions. This can be a relatively easy solu-
tion to prevent contrail formations and their effects, given that a comparably small proportion of
aircraft contributes majorly. Physics-based models such as CoCIP[ 9] and APCEMM[ 10] simulate
contrails’ microphysics and radiative transfer effects but suffer from uncertainties in their inputs.
These uncertainties -such as the spatial resolution of numerical weather models and limitations of
high-altitude humidity measurements[ 11]) - result in large errors in contrail RF predictions from
such models. Contrail detection work in aerial images can be largely attributed to Mannstein et
al.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This algorithm operates on brightness temperature imagery using a
sequence of manually designed convolution and thresholding procedures, followed by recognizing
appropriate linear linked components. The algorithm is tuned to have either high precision or recall;
however, no single model has succeeded in achieving both simultaneously. Apart from this, deep learn-
ing models have been used for contrail detection using images of GOES-16 satellite[ 19] and images
from Himawari-8 stationary satellite[ 20]. However, apart from [ 21] that has used Hough Transforms
to segment A VHRR imagery, no work to our knowledge, has been done in over two decades to
implement neural network-based segmentation models for contrails detection and Landsat-8 data.
This work explores the potential of ’deep convolutional nets’ to identify and segment contrails in
satellite imagery. For this purpose, we use popular semantic segmentation models, such as UNet[ 22],
PSP Net[ 23], DeepLab V3[ 24] and DeepLab V3+[ 25] with different combinations of loss functions
and encoders to adjust it accordingly for capturing the intricacies of contrails and achieve a more
generalized result. We train these models on the labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset proposed by
[2], which consists of several scenes from the Landsat-8 satellite in which the contrails have been
identified and marked as bounding polygons. We hope our proposed methods can be used as a
benchmark for further work on this dataset and open the way for more substantial research on this
domain.
2 Data
The dataset[ 2] includes Landsat-8 scenes (primarily from 2018 and inside the viewable extent of the
GOES-16 satellite), which have been reviewed by human labellers taught to identify and mark the
bounding polygon of each contrail in the scene. The dataset has 4289 scenes primarily from 2018 of
the Landsat-8 satellite, out of which 47% of scenes have at least one contrail.
While prediction work has already been done on the GOES-16 and other NOAA series satellite
images, using images of a low-earth orbit satellite such as Landsat-8 is beneficial for contrails as
its images have a high spatial resolution of 30m and 100m per pixel for cirrus and thermal infrared
bands respectively. This makes it easier to distinguish contrails from natural cirrus clouds, which are
made of ice crystals and look like long and thin white lines. Each scene has a true-color RGB image,
a false color image, and labeled contrail points for this purpose.
We use the false colour images and the contrail labels by generating them as a ground truth mask for
each image. False colour images are generated by extracting the brightness temperature difference
or red channel between the 12 µm and 11 µm bands, the 1.37 µm cirrus cloud reflectance band,
which is the green channel and is omitted for nighttime images to avoid confusion and the 12 µm
brightness temperature blue channel. The contrails in these images appear as black linear clouds,
making it easier for the models to differentiate between cirrus clouds and contrails than RGB images
for segmentation.
3 Methodology
3.1 Dataset Preprocessing
The dataset is available in JSON string format stored in Google Cloud Storage. There are 100 files,
each with the Landsat-8 filename, polygon bounds of contrails in the scene, and deidentified advected
flight waypoints for each labeled scene. We manually preprocessed the data by constructing the
2ground truth mask from the polygon bounds using matplotlib collections[ 26]. We then resized the
images and the masks to 512x512 dimensions for training; anything less than 512 led to a deterioration
in results. We use only images with at least one contrail for training due to class imbalance between
contrails and background and to help the model generalize better. The dataset has been further divided
into 80% for training (1737) and 20% for testing (434). We opted to use the false color images as it
was visually easier to identify the contrail than RGB images. Experimentally as well, the models
performed better on false color images.
3.2 Models
We experimented with different types of state-of-the-art segmentation networks, namely UNet[ 22],
an encoder-decoder-based standard network, PSP Net[ 23], a pyramid pooling module-based network,
DeepLabV3[ 24] and DeepLabV3+[ 25] which are a combination of both encoder-decoder and pyramid
pooling-based module. We used multiple backbones for each of these architectures. We employed
Resnet101[ 27],ResNeXt101-32x4d[ 28] and Xception71[ 29] with ImageNet pretrained weights.We
experimented with both pretrained weights and random initialization and found that although results
were almost the same, using pretrained weights helped the models to converge at least 30% faster.
We chose these backbones for our segmentation models as[ 30] showed them as most effective for
semantic segmentation of fine lines.
Adam optimizer was used for all these instances with a learning rate of 0.0001 and sigmoid activa-
tion function. We tried various loss functions such as Focal[ 31], Tversky[ 32], Focal-Tversky[ 33],
Dice[ 34], and Jaccard loss[ 35]. Intersection over Union (IoU) was used as the primary evaluation
metric. We used different loss functions and noticed that an over-suppression of the Focal-Tversky
is observed when the class accuracy is high, as the model is close to convergence. In contrast, for
Dice loss, we noticed that it is very unstable as the model goes closer to converges and hence doesn’t
converge well. To combat these shortcomings, we used a combination of Dice and Focal-Tversky
loss, as shown in equation. 1.

4 Results
Table 1 compares the train and test IoU of all the segmentation models-encoder combinations. While
there is about ±0.03 difference in the IoUs among all the combinations, we notice that the combination
of UNet[ 22] architecture with Xception 71[ 29] backbone gives the best IoU of 0.4395 . While the
IoU was low, the model produced satisfactory contrail masks. We attribute this to the fact that the
fundamental shape of the labels, i.e. thin and long hence IoU calculation is affected drastically if
the prediction is even a few pixels off. We also tried simple data augmentation techniques, such as
rotation and flipping, which didn’t improve the IoU. Also, since we used false color images for our
purpose, using hue saturation augmentation caused deterioration in our results.
We also noticed several mislabeled masks of contrails in the dataset. The dataset has several noisy
labels due to manual labelling, due to which it suffers from large intra and inter-observer variability.
Furthermore, numerous contrail labels in the dataset are broader than the corresponding visible
contrail in the original image. This and a severe class imbalance in the dataset were the two significant
issues limiting the model’s ability. We have used Dice and Focal-Tversky to create our loss function,
as these are well known for dealing with class imbalance issues. We chose to consider images with at

performed convincingly on the test dataset, evident in examples of the model’s predictions against

5 Conclusion
Contrails account for about 57% of the global warming caused by the aviation industry[ 36]. Robust
contrail detection and segmentation is the first step in quantifying its lifetime impact and linking it to
possible flights that may have caused it, thus assisting in tracking and avoiding contrails.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a detailed work on Landsat-8 data and
evaluation on benchmarking of different state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation for
contrail detection. Using false color images of Landsat-8 imagery, we achieve 0.4395 testing IoU
UNet architecture with Xception 71 backbone. While the IoU is low, it fails to capture the model’s
true performance on the task. In our experiments, the model is more often than not able to segment
contrails proficiently.
While this work is a solid first step in utilizing deep learning methods for contrail detection, there is
much room for improvement. In future studies, we would like to experiment with temperature-based
colour preprocessing. To test the model’s robustness, we want to calculate uncertainty estimates under
varying domains of satellite imagery and evaluate the model using a more suitable metric instead of
IoU. Contextual information can also be incorporated based on publicly available datasets, such as
overlapping segmentation masks containing land cover, naturally occurring clouds, flight paths etc.
Another avenue for future experiments could be using self-supervised and pseudo-labelling training
techniques, attention-based models, introduction of discriminator and vision transformers.
