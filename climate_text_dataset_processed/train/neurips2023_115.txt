Abstract
Several studies have indicated that delivering insights and feedback on water usage
has been effective in curbing water consumption, making it a pivotal component in
achieving long-term sustainability objectives. Despite a significant proportion of
water consumption originating from large residential and commercial buildings,
there is a scarcity of cost-effective and easy-to-integrate solutions that provide
water usage insights in such structures. Furthermore, existing methods for disag-
gregating water usage necessitate training data and rely on frequent data sampling
to capture patterns, both of which pose challenges when scaling up and adapting
to new environments. In this work, we aim to solve these challenges through a
novel end-to-end approach which records data from pressure sensors and uses time-
series classification by DNN models to determine room-wise water consumption
in a building. This consumption data is then fed to a novel water disaggregation
algorithm which can suggest a set of water-usage events, and has a flexible require-
ment of training data and sampling granularity. We conduct experiments using
our approach and demonstrate its potential as a promising avenue for in-depth
exploration, offering valuable insights into water usage on a large scale.
1 Introduction
Efficient water use is essential for long-term sustainability goals. To achieve this, it’s crucial to
provide individuals and organizations with tools to optimize water usage effectively. One such
approach is offering water usage insights, which informs decisions about water use and infrastructure
design. Studies show that real-time feedback through smart meters and digital solutions can reduce
water consumption by up to 30% [ 1,2]. Beyond reducing consumption, water usage insights can
also lower energy usage in water systems, ensure fair billing, and detect leaks. While a significant
percentage of water consumption can be attributed to commercial and residential buildings due
to high occupant density, there is a lack of viable solutions which provide these insights on such
large-scales. In this work, we present PressureML , an end-to-end and scalable approach leveraging
DNN to generate real-time water usage feedback in buildings. Delivering such feedback involves
two stages: 1. Recording water usage data at an appropriate level of detail in time and space , and 2.
Using disaggregation techniques to identify specific fixture or appliance-level usage.

Climate impact Our work aims at reducing water consumption and enabling sustainable water
management practices. According to the UN World Water Development Report [ 3], this directly
translates to reduction in energy used in treatment, transportation and waste-management of water,
ultimately reducing carbon emissions. Further, it reduces the supply pressure on natural ecosystems
and groundwater, thus protecting them for a sustainable future.
Related work Current methods for recording total water usage primarily involve installing elec-
tromagnetic or ultrasonic-pulse water meters at the main inlet of individual houses [ 4]. They are,
however, (i) Difficult to use in a multi-inlet setting, (ii) Economically expensive to install for every
house or area, (iii) Challenging to retrofit by cutting pipes, and (iv) Require high maintenance due to
sensitive components. HydroSense[ 5] takes a different approach by calculating volume usage from
pressure sensors for a set of fixtures in a house, but requires extensive labelled data and calibration ef-
forts. Our approach, however, is able to get volume usage for multiple floors simultaneously, and does
not require fixture-level training data and calibration. Water-usage event disaggregation research ef-
forts [ 6,7,8] primarily rely on identifying and encoding distinct features and usage patterns associated
with different fixtures or appliances. However, current approaches face one or more of the following
challenges: (i) Focus on high-frequency input data, (ii) Requirement of environment-specific training
data, and (iii) Requirement of additional sensing infrastructure. PressureML addresses the aforemen-
tioned challenges by presenting a cost-effective solution which can be easily integrated in various
water system configurations in residential and commercial complexes.
In this work, we focus on high-rise residential apartments, where each house’s areas (such as bath-
rooms and kitchens) on multiple floors (divided into zones) [ 9] are connected via dedicated pipelines
supplied by a gravity-based distribution network, fed by overhead tanks (OHT). PressureML pro-
poses a novel approach that shifts from collecting individual water-usage readings for all areas within
each house to obtaining data for each area across all houses. The overall architecture of the solution is
presented in figure 1a. A high-resolution pressure sensor is installed at the top of each vertical pipeline
within a zone. When an end-user valve is opened or closed, the velocity of water in the pipeline
changes rapidly, and transient pressure wave called water hammer is generated and recorded by the
pressure sensor. The signature and magnitude of the wave can be characterised by valve-dependent
factors such as the rate of change of velocity of water, distance of the source to the sensor, and
reflections in the pipeline [ 10]. Utilizing DNN architectures, we model these time-series waves to
identify the specific floor of water usage. While this modelling inherently requires minimal training
data due to significant inter-class variability, cross-deployment adaptability, and potential use of
physics-based simulations, we employ data augmentation techniques and transfer learning to enhance
performance, for which we explore and evaluate multiple pre-training architectures and datasets. The
aggregate water consumption for each floor and area is then calculated by analyzing the duration of
pressure drop events. Subsequently, this data is input into the second stage of PressureML , where it
is disaggregated into valve-level events. We describe this stage in detail in section 3.
2 Pressure wave classification
Experiment setup and data To develop and evaluate the pressure wave-classification approach,
we simulated a 4-floor pressure zone of a building using a test setup consisting of a network of pipes
and user-operated taps installed across 4 floors, fed by an OHT. A pressure sensor with a sampling
frequency of 500Hz was installed at the outlet valve of the OHT. While collecting data, the tap at each
floor was opened and closed at 2 different speeds - fast (0.5-1 sec), and slow (1.5-3 sec). 1 experiment
iteration at a floor consists of 4 events: Open and Close at 2 speeds. Experiments being manual, a
2small dataset of 4 such iterations per floor was recorded, leading to a total of 32 open samples and 32
close samples across 4 classes (floors). A few recorded waveforms are shown in figure 1b.
Event extraction First, the transient section of a pressure wave is extracted from a buffered or
continuous stream of data. After passing through a low-pass filter to eliminate noise and highlight the
underlying pattern of the signal, rapid pressure changes (denoting open/close events) are found using
a forward difference quotient as: ∆p(t) =p(t+k)−p(t)
k. To accommodate different rates of change in
pressure due to different valve-operation speeds, multiple such quotients are computed with varying
k(50,100,500) , whose value is determined in accordance with the sampling frequency of the sensor.
Event starting points are marked when the quotient with the largest average value in an event exceeds
an empirical threshold (0.01 in our case), while event end points are marked when majority of the
quotients are below a threshold (0.005 in our case) for kcontinuous values. All such events extracted
are upsampled/downsampled to have a uniform length of 256 points.
Data augmentation To prevent DNN models used for event classification from over-fitting due to
limited training data, we employ data augmentation, which has previously shown benefits even in
time-series classification (TSC) tasks [ 11]. A recursive and incremental augmentation approach is
used, involving transformations suited for our TSC task. These include i. Jittering [ 11], which adds
Gaussian noise, ii. Window warp [ 12], which stretches and constricts a time-window, iii. Magnitude
warp [ 12], which randomly stretches and constricts across magnitude dimension, and iv. DGW-sD
[12], which uses discriminative shape descriptors for guided warping. Using these augmentations,
we increase our dataset size four times to 128 open samples and 128 close samples.
Transfer learning To classify pressure waves into floors of their origin, we use a Transfer Learning
approach, which, after vision-based tasks, has recently shown performance gains in time-series
classification tasks(TSC) as well [ 1]. We explore this approach across two axis : state-of-the-art
TSC models, and time-series datasets, used for pre-training. We pre-train each model on each of the
source dataset and then finetune it on our collected pressure dataset. We handpick 4 datasets from
the UCR Time Series archive [ 13], which have >1000 labelled samples, 1 feature dimension, vary
in terms of number of classes, sequence length and source of data, and naturally would fit for our
downstream task. For models with sequence length-dependent blocks like LSTM and Attention, we
resample the source length to match with the target length of 256. We also include in this analysis
an additional modified dataset (PressureLD, with sequence length =256 and number of classes =4)
consisting of pressure sensor signals recorded to detect leaks in a water distribution system [ 14]. This
helps to consider the effect of pre-training on data from the same modality as that of the target task.
Aggregate volume calculation A particular water usage instance is bounded by an open(start) and
close(end) event. Based on these floor-wise classified events, a square waveform is computed for each
floor with y-axis representing pressure and x-axis representing time. Area under the curve (AUC)
is calculated, with static pressure level as the base. Entire timeline is then broken into windows of
width w, and scaled area falling in that window is denoted as its total water volume consumed. This
approach works for overlapping events as well, wherein greater pressure drop will give higher AUC
value for that time-frame. Since water-usage insights do not require real-time updates, we analyse
data and generate insights at the end of each day. This allows employing statistical usage heuristics
for disaggregation, and can provide more context for classification.
3 Disaggregating Events
This section describes the second stage of our proposed solution, which provides fixture-level water
usage insights from aggregate volume usage of a particular area (like bathroom or kitchen). To make
the solution adaptable to diverse usage patterns, varying sampling frequencies and fittings in different
water systems, the proposed water disaggregation algorithm doesn’t require labelled training data to
learn differentiating features, but rather takes as input only general specifications about the system
configuration, which is mostly known by domain experts, or can easily be found or measured. This
includes the number of fixtures N(different operating modes of each fixture counted separately), their
corresponding volume consumed in one usage v(n), and approximate flow-rates r(n). The proposed
algorithm uses combinatorial optimization to find the best subset of fixtures for a given usage instance
of continuous non-zero flow. For a usage event θwith total volume consumed V, we solve:
argmaxk(n)Y
np(k(n)v|θ)such that (1−σ)V≤X
nk(n)v≤(1+σ)Vwhere k(n)∈Z, n∈[1, N]
where σis the error margin, and p(k(n)v|θ)is calculated using general heuristics such as possibility
of a fixture’s contribution given its flow rate ( r(n)) and actual water used in each window wofθ,

and the approximate number of large events occurring per day. Additional heuristics can be used to
prune the search space and build a better probability distribution. The proposed method is suitable
for overlapping events as well as events split across multiple w. As we deal with individual areas, the
search space of fixtures is small, making this approach feasible.
4 Results and conclusion
Table 1 presents that the proposed transfer learning approach is able to classify pressure waves with
high F1 scores and can enable classification with less training data for PressureML . CNN based
models perform better as compared to RNN or Attention-based models, possibly due to less inter-
dependence on long and short term context, but a significant presence of patterns in the time-series
data. Also, the influence of source dataset used for pre-training is small if chosen reasonably, while
model used plays a more crucial role in downstream task performance. The results are promising as
the best-performing ResNet model achieves an F1 score of 1 for both open and close events. This
calls for a more extensive evaluation study, which we plan to do in future work. We do preliminary
evaluation of the presented water disaggregation algorithm on an aggregate water consumption data
of a house in residential building collected at an interval of 5 min, where labelled data of fixture-level
usage in a bathroom was available for a duration of 1 week. Overall accuracy of top-3 suggestions
of presented method was 78%. Figure 2 presents the temporal water meter data showing total
consumption and disaggregation output of our proposed method for a time window of 8 hours.
This paper introduces PressureML , an end-to-end method for deriving water usage insights in large-
scale buildings, presenting a two-stage solution by first determining aggregate water consumption per
floor area by analyzing pressure waves, and then employing an innovative disaggregation algorithm
for fixture-level insights. Our approach demonstrates promising potential for accuracy and scalability,
as evidenced by our evaluations. Future work will extend these evaluations, and explore important
avenues such as handling overlapping waves, utilizing physics-based simulations for improved feature
learning, testing cross-deployment adaptability, and optimizing the disaggregation algorithm’s search
space. Our contributions aim to advance the understanding and implementation of water usage
insights in real-world scenarios.
