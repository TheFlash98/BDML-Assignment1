ABSTRACT
Precipitation-related extreme events are rapidly growing due to climate change,
emphasizing the need for accurate hazard projections. To effectively model the
convective phenomena driving severe precipitation, high-resolution estimates are
crucial. Existing methods struggle with either insufficient expressiveness in cap-
turing complex convective dynamics, due to the low resolution, or excessive com-
putational demands. In response, we propose an innovative deep learning frame-
work that efficiently harnesses available data to yield precise results. This model,
based on graph neural networks, utilises two grids with different resolution and
two sets of edges to represent spatial relationships. Employing as input ERA5
reanalysis atmospheric variables on an approximately 25km grid, the framework
produces hourly precipitation estimates on a finer 3km grid. Findings are promis-
ing in accurately capturing yearly precipitation distribution and estimating cu-
mulative precipitation during extreme events. Notably, the model demonstrates
effectiveness in spatial regions not included in the training, motivating further ex-
ploration of its transferability potential.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Every year across the world, natural catastrophes cause casualties and significant damage to proper-
ties and assets and the trend in weather related extremes is growing, due to climate change (IPCC,
2022). Precipitation-related events (flood, drought, landslides) have a tremendous social and eco-
nomical impact and are all projected to increase (Van Aalst, 2006; Banholzer et al., 2014). Disaster
risk forecasting highly depends on the ability to correctly quantify the hazard related to the nat-
ural phenomenon, which is not straightforward, particularly for precipitation. Mainly two types
of precipitation exist: weak and severe. The former is caused by strati-form clouds, uniform and
stable, with no complicated airflow motion. The latter is related to convective systems, complex
and characterised by non-linear airflow motion. Severe precipitation is crucial when considering
extreme events, yet difficult to model. Traditional approaches to estimate precipitation on high-
resolution grids include Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) (Cuo et al., 2011), downscaling
of low-resolution precipitation projections (CORDEX; EUCP; Laflamme et al., 2016) and Convec-
tion Permitting Models (CMPs) (Coppola et al., 2020; Kendon et al., 2021). QPE and downscaling
are cost-effective, but struggle in modelling severe precipitation, while CPMs can correctly model
convective systems, but high resolution comes at an enormous computational cost. In this setting,
models based on Machine Learning (ML) and particularly Deep Learning (DL) may play an impor-
tant role bringing both improved accuracy in severe events modelling and significant computational
speed-up. DL models have been used to reproduce QPEs results (Wang et al., 2022), to improve
downscaling (Reddy et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023), and few studies addressed the problem of
building emulators for precipitation (Wang et al., 2021; Doury et al., 2023,Addison et al., 2022).
This study, represents a first attempt in building a DL model that resembles convection permitting

dynamical models, with the aim of estimating precipitation distribution at high spatial and tempo-
ral resolution. Furthermore, the proposed framework does not use precipitation as predictor and is
trained using reanalysis data, which are less biased than model data, conventionally used in training
emulators. Nonetheless, climate model data can be used as input for the model during the pre-
diction phase to derive precipitation projections. This will be investigated in a future stage, being
particularly meaningful to quantify the impact of climate change on precipitation, especially severe
precipitation.
The framework is based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) (Battaglia et al., 2018; Sanchez-
Lengeling et al., 2021; Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) which have recently emerged as a powerful tool
in the field of ML, particularly for tasks involving relational data and graph structures. GNNs can
capture complex relationships and dependencies within data, making them well-suited for different
applications, and have been recently used in climate-related studies (Lam et al., 2023). One of the
notable advantages of GNNs is their capacity for transferability across different domains, i.e. GNNs
can be trained on one graph and effectively applied to other graphs with similar structural charac-
teristics. This results in a flexible framework, providing the opportunity to investigate predictive
capabilities across geographical areas distinct from those encountered during the training.
2 M ETHODOLOGY
2.1 D ATA
Five atmospheric variables are used as predictors, at five levels of pressure (Table 1) each repre-
sented on a low-resolution grid of 0.25◦longitude-latitude ( ∼25km for Europe). Hourly values are
considered for predictors. As training input data, these variables are taken from the ERA5 reanaly-
sis dataset (Hersbach et al., 2020) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF). The use of reanalysis data to train the DL model presents several advantages over rely-
ing on climate model data. Reanalysis data assimilate a wide range of observational data, providing
a more accurate representation of historical climate conditions. This approach helps mitigate biases
and uncertainties that may be inherent in climate model simulations. Conversely, the use of climate
models data is beneficial when the objective is to derive future projections and may be used during
the prediction phase. Additionally, a remapping of the global multi-resolution terrain elevation data
(Danielson & Gesch, 2011) to a grid of 3km is used as a predictor. Input atmospheric variables and
topographic altitude are both normalized to zero-mean unit-variance. Atmospheric variables data
at five time instants are considered for an individual hourly prediction: the prediction time and the
6,12,18and24hours before.

The GRidded Italian Precipitation Hourly Observations (GRIPHO), a high-resolution hourly pre-
cipitation dataset for Italy (Fantini, 2019), was selected as the target for this framework. Orig-
inally developed to support hydrological models and validate Regional Climate Models (RCMs)
simulations, GRIPHO utilises raw station data from CETEMPS (Verdecchia, 2019), the sole high-
resolution station-based dataset covering the entire country from 2001 to 2016. Following cleaning
and re-gridding processes, the data is represented over a 3 km Lambert Conformal Conic grid, which
is not orthogogal, neither regular in longitute-latitude coordinates.

2.2 G RAPH CONCEPTUALIZATION
Each point within the low-resolution and high-resolution grids corresponds to a specific geograph-
ical location, suggesting to model both grids as a unified heterogeneous graph featuring two node-
and two edge-types:
•Low nodes: first set of nodes, generated from the points on the low-resolution grid with
spatial resolution of approximately 25 km.
•High nodes: second set of nodes, created from the points on the high-resolution grid with
spatial resolution of 3 km.
•Low-to-High edges: unidirectional edges, which connect Low nodes to High nodes, with
each High node linked to a fixed number k= 9 ofLow nodes, chosen through k-Nearest
Neighbours (k-NN); these edges model the downscaling of atmospheric variable informa-
tion from the Low nodes to the High nodes (Figure 1a).
•High-within-High edges: bidirectional edges that capture relationships among High nodes
based on an 8-neighbors approach, ensuring each node is connected to its eight nearest
neighbors (Figure 1b).

2.3 DL M ODEL
A notable characteristic of the target dataset is that 90% of its values fall below the meteorological
threshold for precipitation, assumed as 0.1mm, effectively rendering them as zeros. This inherent
imbalance significantly impacts the training of DL models. To mitigate this challenge, the Hurdle
approach (Cragg, 1971) is adopted, through the construction of two distinct models: a Classifier
and a Regressor . The Classifier is trained on the entire dataset and discerns between two classes: 0,
i.e. precipitation below the threshold, and 1, i.e. precipitation above the threshold. Conversely, the
Regressor is exclusively trained on targets where precipitation values exceed the threshold, and pro-
vides a quantitative estimation of hourly precipitation. During the evaluation phase, predictions from
both models are computed and subsequently multiplied to yield a singular estimate of the precipi-
tation value. A scheme of the Hurdle approach adopted in this framework is depicted in Figure 2a.
Models share the same GNN structure, which consists of three primary modules (see Figure 2b).
First, a downscaler module, which employs a single message passing layer to map atmospheric
variables, represented as Low node features, to learned attributes on the High nodes. Following
this, a processor module that updates information on the High nodes, starting from the learned at-
tributes and the topographic altitude, incorporating spatial relationships through a sequence of five
message passing layers. Finally, the predictor module, which utilises a feed-forward network to
make the ultimate prediction based on the processed information from the preceding modules. The
model is entirely implemented in PyTorch, using as GNN layers graph convolutions with attention
(Veli ˇckovi ´c et al., 2017), particularly the GATv2Conv layer from (Brody et al., 2021). The choice of
using GNNs is particularly effective for mainly two reasons: overcome the issue of having different
3Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
coordinate systems of input/output grids, causing them to be not nested, and the potential tranfer-
ability to different spatial domains, allowing predictions on graphs with different number of nodes
from that of the training graphs.

2.4 T RAINING AND TESTING
The geographical area considered for training is approximately 120.000km2(see Figure 3a) with
720Low nodes and 14036 High nodes, representing the north of Italy. A time span of 15years,
from 2001 to2015 is considered for training. The time span was subdivided as 90% training set and
10% validation set. The year 2016 was instead used for testing. Focal Loss (FL) (Lin et al., 2017)
(see Appendix A.1) was used to train the Classifier model, while the Regressor was trained using
Weighted Mean Square Error (WMSE) loss as in Wang et al. (2022) (see Appendix A.2). Both Clas-
sifier andRegressor models were separately trained for 24hours on 4×NVIDIA Ampere GPUs on
Leonardo, the new pre-exascale Tier-0 EuroHPC supercomputer hosted by CINECA and currently
built in the Bologna Technopole, Italy (Turisini et al., 2023). The model was then tested by deriving
precipitation estimates for all the Italian territory, approximately 300.000km2(see Figure 3a), with
2646 Low nodes and 33153 High nodes, in order to check its effectiveness also in spatial regions be-
yond its training scope. The trained framework demands only few minutes for getting precipitation
estimates for an entire year, making it one of its main advantages. This in fact significantly contrasts
with the time demands of convection-permitting dynamical models, which necessitate days to yield
results on an equivalent high-resolution grid. The framework was verified in its ability of estimating
annual precipitation distribution, as well as cumulative precipitation during extreme events.
3 R ESULTS
Figure 3 shows the results obtained utilising the proposed framework on the testing area and pe-
riod, compared to observations taken from the GRIPHO dataset. More specifically, Figure 3b and
Figure 3c show the aggregated results for the testing year 2016 , respectively in terms of cumulative
precipitation and precipitation intensity distribution. Results are overall good, with predictions that
sometimes slightly underestimate or overestimate the observations, particularly in the areas beyond
the training scope. Figure 3d shows the time series of average hourly precipitation. This plots shows
how the DL results are able to match quite well the observation at the desired high temporal res-
olution, specifically the peaks, with a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Note that the RMSE
is given with sign to show where the DL results overestimate (positive RMSE) or underestimate
(negative RMSE) the observation at the considered hourly time step. Figure 3e shows instead the
cumulative precipitation for a set of six extreme events that took place in the time span and areas
considered in the study1. Also in this case, the framework is able to capture the event total precip-
itation, both in terms of area extension and intensity. As expected, a worsening in performance is
observed as the considered region moves away from the training area. Nevertheless, the ability of the
framework to generalise both in space and in time suggests it learned an approximation of the phys-
ical relation between the large scale dynamic and the local scale precipitation, possibly improvable
by fine-tuning the model over a wider area.

4 C ONCLUSION
The developed framework has demonstrated promising outcomes, accurately capturing yearly pre-
cipitation distribution and closely representing total precipitation during examined extreme events.
Findings indicate good generalization capabilities in spatial and temporal domains, motivating fur-
ther investigation into its transferability potential. Moreover, results can still be improved by re-
fining the architecture, thanks to the flexibility provided by the framework. The subsequent phase
involves incorporating diverse regions beyond the Italian territory in both training and testing. Fu-
ture project stages aim to extend the framework’s application to predict High Precipitation weather
Events (HPEs) by utilising convection-permitting RCMs ensemble simulations within the central
Mediterranean domain. This introduces a notable challenge, as the prediction phase involves the
adoption of model-generated predictors for a framework trained on reanalysis data. Additionally,
adaptability across various ensemble members of RCMs will be assessed, and outcomes will be
compared with those of conventional dynamical downscaling methods. This thorough evaluation
aims to investigate the effectiveness and reliability of the framework in simulating extreme events,
a crucial aspect in addressing the challenges posed by climate change.
