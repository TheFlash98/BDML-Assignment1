Abstract
Wildfires are becoming unpredictable natural hazards in many regions due to
climate change. However, existing state-of-the-art wildfire forecasting tools, such
as the Fire Weather Index (FWI), rely solely on meteorological input parameters
and have limited ability to model the increasingly dynamic nature of wildfires. In
response to the escalating threat, our work addresses this shortcoming in short-
term fire hazard prediction. First, we present a comprehensive and high fidelity
remotely sensed active fire dataset fused from over 20 satellites. Second, we
develop region-specific ML-based 3-7 day wildfire hazard prediction models for
South America, Australia, and Southern Europe. The different models cover
pixel-wise, spatial and spatio-temporal architectures, and utilize weather, fuel and
location data. We evaluate the models using time-based cross-validation and can
show superior performance with a PR-AUC score up to 44 times higher compared
to the baseline FWI model. Using explainable AI methods, we show that these
data-driven models are also capable of learning meaningful physical patterns and
inferring region-specific wildfire drivers.
Climate Impact Boreal forests are the largest terrestrial carbon sink, storing more than one-third of
all terrestrial carbon [ 45]. Wildfires are a serious threat to them; for example, between March and July
2023, hundreds of fires burned out of control in Canada, consuming more than 3% of the country’s
total forest area [ 6,7,26]. These wildfires can turn forests from a carbon sink to a carbon source if
vegetation regrowth cannot compensate, further accelerating climate change [ 2,14,20,40,45]. At
the same time, climate change itself is altering fire regimes worldwide. Regions with ecologically
beneficial wildfires are experiencing extreme drought, often leaving insufficient flammable vegetation
to support regular fire regimes; Other regions are experiencing more frequent and catastrophic
wildfires [ 4,14,22]. The timely and accurate prediction of wildfire hazard is a critical element
in limiting the negative impacts of wildfires by supporting the efficient deployment of firefighting
resources. It can also help improve early warning systems that protect communities, ecosystems,
and critical infrastructure. Machine learning models have proven to be a valuable tool for this
prediction [1, 15, 31, 33].
In this paper, we present a high-quality dataset of active fires that has been compiled and harmonized
from more than 20 different satellites. We demonstrate its potential for wildfire hazard modeling by
building models for up to 1 week in advance wildfire prediction based on weather and fuel data. The
models outperform widely used hazard indices such as the Fire Weather Index (FWI) over the entire
precision-recall curve. We utilize explainable AI methods to verify that the models use physically
plausible patterns. We also discuss how the models can be used to support practical decision making
and highlight remaining challenges.
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.1 Dataset
In this paper, we selected three study regions with very different fuel and weather characteristics [9,
18,27]:Australia ,Brazil , and Greece . We use data from October 2019 - October 2022 aggregated to
daily values at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degree ( ≈11 km).
Fire Hazard We approximate the hazard by predicting the occurrence of wildfires. We curated
the fire event ground truth data product in our company by assimilating over 20 satellite products
from both LEO and GEO satellites1, employing a spectrum of instruments encompassing infrared
and multi-spectral visual sensors to create our active fire satellite data product. A detailed description
can be found in Table 1. We chose active fire data over burned area data, due to its real-time nature,
ensuring immediate and accurate representation of ongoing fire dynamics. Burned area data often lags
by several days, introducing inaccuracies, especially for smaller fires that might be underestimated
or missed entirely [ 5]. The data sources are retrieved from the respective operator/data provider
through different terrestrial and satellite-based links. Subsequently, they are standardized in terms of
format and type to ensure compatibility for future processing steps. Hotspots representing thermal
anomalies are generated in the first processing stage, either by derivation or direct ingestion as
third-party data products. The hotspots, along with auxiliary data like Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and
brightness temperature, are processed and aggregated along with third-party fire products into active
fires clusters. We then employ advanced clustering methods to filter out persistent heat sources (e.g.,
factories, volcanoes), reflections (e.g., water, solar panels, steel roofs), and false positives through
correlation with environmental datasets to enhance the precision of our final active fire satellite data
product. Each cluster is assigned a confidence value based on the count of satellites and fire detection
algorithms linked to the hotspots within a given cluster. For this study, clusters with a confidence
level exceeding 0.5 were included to account for a reasonable degree of certainty.
Hazard Factors Two critical wildfire hazard factors are weather , used by virtually all approaches
including physical [ 25], statistical [ 17], and AI-based [ 11,21], and available fuel. In our approach,
we combine both: We incorporate weather data from the ERA5-Land dataset, aggregating hourly
measurements to daily at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees [ 12,16,36]. We also utilize fuel
information via the ESA CCI Landcover dataset, which provides fine-grained information about
what physical material is present where on the Earth’s surface [ 13,44]. We group the 22 classes of
potential wildfire fuels into nine combined classes (cf. Table 3). We also use derived features that
previous research has shown to be helpful in predicting wildfires [ 32,41]: we calculate the wind
speed, include the geographic location as well as the day of year. We provide further details in Table 1.
All data including the fire hazard labels are projected into the ERA-5 native 0.1 degree resolution.
2 Methodology
Modelling We study four different types of models: (1) the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) [37]
is a widely adopted fire danger rating system, for example in the European Forest Fire Information
System (EFFIS). It calculates daily fire danger based on previous day’s weather data, but it often
overestimates fire hazard and neglects spatial and temporal variations. It also assumes a uniform
forest fuel type, which can lead to inaccuracies in ecosystems different from boreal forests [ 38]. (2) a
simple random forest [3] baseline which makes independent predictions for each location, (3) a U-Net
model [ 34] that can model spatial correlations between adjacent locations, and (4) a 3d U-Net [10,23]
which receives a temporal sequence of past weather data for up to 7 days in addition to landcover.
For further details about model architecture and the training procedure, please refer to Appendix B.
Evaluation Our fire hazard dataset is heavily imbalanced with only 0.26-3.40% of all pixels
belonging to the fire class, the total percentage varying across folds, cf. Table 5 in the appendix. The
highly unbalanced label set requires careful selection of evaluation metrics. For example, predicting
the majority ("no burn") class would lead to high accuracy metric while being useless in practice.
Thus, we focus on two metrics, the precision (How many will burn decisions were correct?) and
recall (How many actually burned pixels did my model correctly predict?). These two metrics
naturally compete with each other, and different decision thresholds lead to a trade-off between the

two. Therefore, we also provide precision-recall curves that visualize this trade-off. The area under
the precision recall curve (PR-AUC) is used to summarize the curves into a single number.
Experiments In order to assess the robustness of our models, we have designed a sixfold cross-
validation approach that makes optimal use of the limited data available to us, while still accounting
for the intricacies of time series forecasting. To avoid data leakage, we use data from 731consecutive
days as our training set and 187consecutive days as our validation and test sets, respectively. This
results in six different folds of about two years of training data and half a year of validation and test
data. Further details can be found in Appendix A.
3 Results & Discussion
We show precision-recall curves for all models and study regions in Fig. 1, as well as the aggregated
PR-AUC scores in Table 7 (in the appendix). Most notably, the results for all learned models are
superior to the baseline Fire Weather Index (FWI) in all regions and along the entire precision-recall
curve. In terms of PR-AUC, the difference between FWI and the best learned models can be as large
as 44-fold as seen for Greece. This underscores the advantages of learned models that can adapt to
region-specific fire regimes, as opposed to hand-crafted indices that require manual adaptation.
A comparison between the learned models is more nuanced: There is no single best model, but
different models are preferred depending on the region and the operating point within the precision-
recall trade-off. Within the U-net family, the 3D U-net with a 3-day lead time is often among the best.
We see a strong difference when comparing different regions, with the best results for Greece and the
worst for Australia.
In the context of hazard modelling, we tend to prioritize recall over precision: Missing a fire event is
more critical than false alarms. However, in practice, we are faced with limited resources, and thus
precision cannot be completely ignored. The exact operational state depends on local conditions and
will be different in different scenarios.
While we can show impressive improvements over widely used indices, both in terms of precision
and recall, and across different operating points, the results are still far from perfect. For instance,
achieving a 50% recall rate (where every other fire event goes undetected) results in a precision
ranging between 5-25%. This may be because wildfires require not only favorable conditions, but
also ignition events. The latter are often difficult to model: Lightning strikes are a known cause of
wildfires and are often hyper-local in nature, requiring high-resolution data. Moreover, in most cases,
the human factor play a decisive role [ 19,24]. While inclusion of input data such as socio-economic
factors may partially improve this, cases such as arson remain hard to model.
This highlights the need for an integrated approach: While hazard models can help prioritize wildfire
mitigation resources and raise public awareness in times of risk, wildfires will continue to ignite.
Thus, additional active fire monitoring and forecast remain crucial components in mitigating the
negative impact of wildfires.

positive ornegative impact on the decision). The bar heights have been normalized such that they
sum to one for each of the three subplots. The color indicates the feature class (orange: fuel, green:
engineered, blue: weather).
Explainable AI - Feature Importance Shapley values [ 8,39] are a method for feature importance
originating from game theory. We utilized this method to exemplarily assess the best performing
model’s (3D Unet) ability to learn physical relationships, cf. Fig. 2 and further details in Appendix C.
The model is able to derive sensible links between fire drivers and forest fires from raw data. As shown
in Fig. 2 different regions display distinct factors contributing to high fire probability predictions,
supporting the need for region-specific models. In Australia, the model incorporates simple key
factors: location, season, and the absence of water and ice. Location and time of the year are
important due to the concentration of flammable vegetation along the coast and the shifting fire
seasons between north and south, which reflects diverse fire patterns across the country [ 35]. In
Brazil, solar radiation, latitude, and precipitation are the primary contributing factors to forest fire
hazard. Latitude’s significance is consistent with studies identifying distinct forest fire hazard zones
at different latitudes, as well as regions with drier conditions [ 30]. Fig. 4 shows that dry conditions
have an increasingly positive contribution towards a will burn prediction in the three days leading up
to an ignition, whereas muggy conditions have an opposing effect. In Greece, location plays a less
significant role due to its small size. Instead, factors such as vegetation, dry conditions, and wind
become more crucial, consistent with findings by previous research [28].
Outlook As our fire hazard models are trained based on historical fire occurrences, instances where
conditions posed a hazard but did not result in ignition are treated as non-hazardous. To mitigate this
limitation for operational utilization of the models, one potential approach is to augment the model
output by incorporating Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) based fuel dryness as an
overlay within the operational hazard assessment. More frequent and high resolution active fire data
would further enhance the model’s performance. This would help provide a more comprehensive and
nuanced understanding of fire hazard, encompassing both historical ignition events and conditions
conducive to fire spread. Additionally, including very relevant human factor [ 19,24] in the input data
besides location through e.g. socioeconomic or infrastructure data could further aid the results as a
proxy for ignition.

Random forests were implemented in scikit-learn [29].
• More details about the models’ hyperparameters can also be found in Table 6.
C Feature Importance Details
• We calculated the Shapely values [8]3using the captum4Python package
•Since we are dealing with a segmentation problem, we get a feature importance tensor of the
same shape as the input ( number _of_features ×lead_time×longitude ×latitude ),
containing negative and positive attributions towards the decision for each output pixel.
•In order to get an aggregated view for each region (cf. Fig. 2, we first took the absolute
values of the attributions scores, and then aggregated all inputs for the same features using
mean aggregation.
•For each sample in each region we chose the pixel with the largest predicted fire hazard that
actually burned.

Low total precipitation shows a growing positive influence on a will burn prediction in the three days
leading up to the ignition of a fire. The 2m dewpoint temperature, on the other hand, is indicative of
humid conditions and has an increasingly inhibitory contribution the closer to the fire.
9Table 2: A description of the satellites used to produce the active fire data product. LEO refers to
low earth orbit satellites and GEO refers to geostationary satellites. Different satellites have different
instruments that can operate in the visual or infrared spectrum. We group satellites with identical
instruments into row groups, e.g. the row group of Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B means that they
both have an SLSTR and an OLCI instrument. There are additional third-party derived data products
based on the instrument measurements. We integrate them all into a single active fire data product.

Table 4: Time series cross-validation. We use data from 731 consecutive days as our training set, and
187 consecutive days as validation and test set, to make the best use of our data while avoiding data
leakage. This leads to six different splits of approximately two years of training data and half a year
of validation, and test data for each run.

Table 7: PR-AUC scores by region and model in percent. Larger values indicate better prediction.
Bold font shows the largest entries per region. We notice that all learned models perform superior to
the FWI. For Brazil, the best result is obtained by Random Forest, while on the other two, 3D U-Net
performs best. Comparing regions, the best scores can be obtained for Greece, while Australia shows
considerably worse performance.
