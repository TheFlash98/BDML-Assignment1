Abstract
As the major ingredient of concrete and asphalt, sand is vital to economic growth,
and will play a key role in aiding the transition to a low carbon society. However, ex-
cessive and unregulated sand mining in the Global South has high socio-economic
and environmental costs, and amplifies the effects of climate change. Sand mines
are characterized by informality and high temporal variability, and data on the
location and extent of these mines tends to be sparse. We propose to build custom
sand-mine detection tools by fine-tuning foundation models for earth observation,
which leverage self supervised learning - a cost-effective and powerful approach
in sparse data regimes. Our preliminary results show that these methods outper-
form fully supervised approaches, with the best performing model achieving an
average precision score of 0.57 for this challenging task. These tools allow for
real-time monitoring of sand mining activity and can enable more effective policy
and regulation, to inform sustainable development.
1 Introduction
Sustainable sand mining is one of the main ecological challenges of the 21st century[ 1–3]. Driven
by rapid urbanization and economic growth1, sand mining activity has tripled over the last 20 years,
and accounts for 85% of all mineral extraction[ 4]. The demand for sand is expected to increase
many-fold, given the key role of sand-intensive infrastructure in aiding the transition to a low-carbon
society2[5] and development. Across the Global South, much of this sand is mined from riverbeds
and riverbanks, and has acute socio-economic and environmental costs. In particular, it threatens to
amplify the impacts of climate change by accelerating flooding, erosion and biodiversity loss[ 1,6].
Despite these adverse consequences, sand mining remains nearly unregulated in most parts of the
world, especially in India where the rate of extraction already far exceeds sustainable levels [ 7–9].
Thus, urgent action is vital to prevent a global sand crisis [10].
The highly pervasive nature of sand mining makes physical monitoring near impossible, given the
scale of the task and the dangers involved [ 2,11]. While the use of satellite imagery to detect

temporal variability, and is often hard to distinguish from natural fluvial processes. As a result, sand
mines are commonly unrepresented in general purpose mine detection tools, most of which focus on
metal extraction.
We propose to address these challenges by using self-supervised learning (SSL), in combination with
open-access medium-resolution satellite imagery, and a new dataset of hand-crafted labels to build a
custom sand mine detection tool. The overarching goal of our project is to produce, and enable the
continued production of high-resolution, real-time maps of sand mining activity. Thus far, a small
body of literature has examined the use of satellite imagery and machine learning to map global
distributions of sand deposits [ 16–19]. This project expands on these ideas, and contributes to the
research on the use of satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor mining activity [ 12,14,20].
In particular, we leverage advances in SSL methods that have recently seen success in the context
of earth observation (EO) [ 21–26]. Here, a global corpus of unlabeled multispectral remote sensing
datasets are used to learn semantic representations of the planet’s surface from freely available satellite
imagery. These pre-trained models, often referred to as foundation models for earth observation
(FMEO), have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks such as object detection and
image segmentation [ 23]. Most importantly, FMEOs typically exploit all available multi-spectral
bands of optical imagery, and some additionally use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. From
existing work on mapping sand and gravel using remote sensing [ 16,18,27–29], we know that RGB,
shortwave infrared, thermal bands, and SAR comprise the bands of importance, underscoring the
importance of FMEOs in this transfer learning paradigm. Our approach will test the ability of these
models to generalize to sand mine segmentation, a novel and perhaps more challenging task than
these models have been tested on previously. In the process we build an understanding of the best
practices required to fine tune these models, especially under distribution shifts. In our analysis, we
compare and contrast the performance of FMEOs with that of fully-supervised approaches.
2 Data and Methods
Figure 1: Mining signatures and seasonal variability: Both panels show a section of the river Betwa,
in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Panel a) and b) are monthly median composites of 10m Sentinel-2
L2A RGB images taken in May 2023 and September 2022, respectively. Insets 1 - 3 contain sub-meter
resolution imagery, and describe some of the nuances and peculiarities of this detection task.
Datasets : We have acquired data (latitude, longitude, timestamp) on sand mining activities across 21
different river basins across India, through a partnership with Veditum India Foundation3. Currently,
these data cover 39 distinct mining sites; we expect to expand this to over 100 sites over the course
of our study. We extract arbitrary-sized observations (ranging in size from 2.5 sq.km to 582 sq.km)
from freely available Sentinel-2 multi-spectral and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery

around visually recognizable sand mining footprints at each site4. A majority of Indian rivers are
characterized by high average flood discharges and large temporal variability [ 30], leading to huge
intra-annual variation in sand deposition rates and mining footprints. We consider these changes to
be strong natural label augmentations (Fig. 1, inset 1). This allows us to obtain multiple labels (of
arbitrary size) for each location that represents the seasonal lifecycle of sand mines. While sub-meter
resolution imagery (Fig. 1, inset 2) captures more precise information on mining activity such as
direct evidence of heavy machinery, we believe that the Sentinel 10m imagery will prove to be an
effective feature set since it captures broad patterns of importance (i.e. scarring, pitting and flooding)
at high temporal & spectral resolution, and is freely available.
Methods: We use river extent polygons downloaded from Open Street Maps to create regions of
interest extending up to 1km on either side of given rivers. We randomly samples image patches of
size 160x160 pixels (1.6km x 1.6km) during training, and use a sliding window to sample the entire
region of interest during validation and inference. Using this method, we generate ∼3100 images for
training per epoch and 380 images for validation. Given the low-data regime this problem inhabits,
we propose to leverage SSL methods, specifically the use of pre-trained FMEOs and fine-tune them
to solve the task of sand mine segmentation. We hypothesize that our approach will lead to higher
performance compared to fully-supervised methods, due to limited learning that is possible with a
small set of labels in a fully-supervised setting. Specifically, we will use SatMAE[ 21], SSL4EO-
S12[ 22], Satlas[ 25] and Scale-MAE [ 26] models5We compare the performance of these models to
fully supervised CNN-based models including U-Nets [33] and SegFormer [34].
We frame this problem as a binary semantic segmentation task with a focus on characterizing the
performance of the detection of the sand mine class. Our labels are highly imbalanced with the
“sandmine” class comprising only 6.07% of the total number of pixels (the remaining being “non-
sandmine”). We apply an inverse-weighting scheme to the binary cross entropy loss during training
in order to account for this imbalance. Both our labels and features are spatially autocorrelated; we
thus cluster observations spatially, and train and validate separately on geographically distinct regions
across India. This helps us to avoid known challenges with standard evaluation approaches, which
tend to overestimate performance in settings with spatial autocorrelation [35, 36].
In addition to conventional fine-tuning of the FMEOs, we will also explore methods to ameliorate
the possible distribution shift issues incurred by transfer learning. This is especially of concern
with the pre-training datasets used by SatMAE (fMoW-Sentinel) and SSL4EO (SSL4EO-S12); the
former exhibits a global north bias and the latter, a strong urban bias - by virtue of their sampling
methodologies. Moreover, the geographical areas of interest for this problem span a very specific
domain - river basins of South Asia, which is likely to be highly under-represented in the pre-training
datasets. We propose to use methods like test-time training[ 37], which is a form of transductive
learning[ 38] whereby, for each test image, a local model is trained by self-supervision. An extreme
form of this would be to learn unsupervised representations of the entire test/validation dataset, which
may also produce desirable results.
4Labelers examine sites using medium-resolution Sentinel-2 RGB imagery, high resolution imagery available
from Google Earth Pro (Maxar, 0.3m) and from Norway’s International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI)
program (Planet, 4.5m), when available.
5These rely on self-supervised approaches that include masked autoencoders (MAE)[ 31], DINO [ 32] and
MoCo[32] for both CNN and ViT-based architectures.
33 Preliminary Results
In policy settings, it is often desirable to balance false positives and false negatives, and therefore
F1 scores are typically employed as the primary metric. However, instead of manually choosing a
trade-off between precision and recall, we use the average precision (AP) metric to summarize the
area under the entire precision-recall curve, which is also less sensitive to class imbalance exhibited
by our dataset. Early experiments with short training runs (20-40 epochs, see Table 1) show that
foundation models outperform fully-supervised methods. Our best performing model (SSL4EO-
ResNet50) exhibits an AP of 0.57 for the sand mine class. However, the F1 score for this model is
0.49 which comprises a relatively high recall (0.69) and low precision (0.39). To characterize the
performance further, we conducted qualitative analyses on the test set and Fig. 2 shows an instance
of the prediction. Fig. 2 panel a) shows ground-truth labels (blue) and predictions (red) by the
best performing model; areas in purple show overlap. The yellow ellipses highlight labels with
medium-to-high uncertainty; indeed, we observe poor model performance in these regions. Currently,
even though human annotators experienced uncertainty about mine extents, we pursued a binary
labeling strategy (mine/no-mine). To ameliorate this issue moving forward, we are examining the
use of multi-class labels which capture different levels of uncertainty during the labeling process.
With this new labeling strategy, along with expanding the training dataset and distribution shift
amelioration methods during fine-tuning, we expect substantial performance improvements in the
near future.

4 Pathways to Climate Impact
This work aims to provide policymakers and civil society with the tools to monitor and regulate sand
mining in an effective and sustainable way, moving closer to managing and mitigating the harmful
effects of climate change on river ecosystems. Our work also furthers progress towards Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG) related to environmental protection on land (SDG 15), responsible
consumption and production (SDG 12), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and sustainable cities and
communities (SDG 11). Finally, the use of FMEO allows researchers to produce better performing
models at reduced computational cost and carbon footprint by leveraging pre-trained models. By
conducting these downstream experiments, we contribute to the understanding of the nuances of
operationalizing such models, and incentivize model reuse in earth observation problems.
