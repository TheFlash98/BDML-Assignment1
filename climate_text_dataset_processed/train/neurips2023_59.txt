Abstract
An invasive species of grass known as “buffelgrass” contributes to severe wildfires
and biodiversity loss in the Southwest United States. We tackle the problem of
predicting buffelgrass “green-ups” (i.e. readiness for herbicidal treatment). To
make our predictions, we explore temporal, visual and multi-modal models that
combine satellite sensing and deep learning. We find that all of our neural-based
approaches improve over conventional buffelgrass green-up models, and discuss
how neural model deployment promises significant resource savings.
1 Introduction
Increasingly severe wildfire seasons dominate headlines; these out-of-control blazes can be among the
most visible results of ongoing climate change [ 20,3]. In the Southwest United States, wildfires are
made worse by an invasive plant, Pennisetum ciliare , known commonly as buffelgrass, because the
grass burns twice as hot as native vegetation [ 17]. Furthermore, buffelgrass is a threat to biodiversity
in many environments [ 15] and poses a particular threat to the Sonoran Desert, where many plants are
not fire adapted; the resulting grass-fire cycle excludes native plants and may result in a conversion of
Sonoran Desert shrubland to monoculture grassland with increasingly severe wildfires [31].
In this paper, we remotely predict buffelgrass readiness for herbicidal treatment using a combination
of satellite sensing and deep learning. Wildfire risk from buffelgrass can be reduced through
effective herbicidal treatments, but only after the plant “greens-up” from favorable conditions to at
least50% greenness [ 8]. Unfortunately, predicting buffelgrass green-up is a difficult task, due to
varying precipitation, soil substrates, sun exposure, elevation, geographic location, etc. [ 29,28,5].
Small groups of dedicated volunteers and professionals rely on conventional precipitation-only
models to allocate resources, but these models suffer from wastefully high false-positive rates [ 8].
Acknowledging urgency, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior recently announced $200,000 in additional
funds for Saguaro National Park buffelgrass treatments alone [ 10]; however, estimates suggest that
treating the entire park would would cost tens of millions of dollars [ 9]. Our paper addresses a
pressing need for intelligent green-up predictions in the fight against buffelgrass.
Contributions Our two main contributions are: (1) improvements over conventional buffelgrass
green-up models using deep learning models and satellite sensing for climate and imagery and (2) an
analysis of the climate factors that influence our model’s predictions. We are not the first to note that
remote sensing offers a way to observe buffelgrass over large tracts of land, although as far as we
are aware we are the first to employ satellite imagery and climate modeling to predict phenological
changes in buffelgrass [ 29,34]. We improve on currently deployed models (based on accumulated

pattern matching, and believe that analogous approaches to ours could be fruitfully deployed for
detecting phenological changes in a variety of flora beyond buffelgrass. We open source our datasets
and training procedures at this repository: https://github.com/lurosenb/phenology_projects
2 Related Work
A comprehensive study by Williams et al. [32] found that the clearest link between anthropogenic
climate change and wildfires is through increased “warming-driven fuel drying.” Buffelgrass
is an example of dry, organic fuel: it dehydrates for three-fourths of the year, becoming yel-
lowish and tinder-dry despite still being alive, and most worryingly it can double in cover ev-
ery 2-3 years [ 30,1]. Recent work has highlighted the effectiveness of herbicidal treatment,
but explicitly calls for increased detection efforts and better resource allocation [ 14]. Field
work and heuristic models based on weather data have been shown to predict the greenness
or spread of known sites with reasonable accuracy[ 21,8,4]. Leveraging publicly available re-
mote sensing technology has also been used in the fight against buffelgrass; Zhao et al. [34],
Figure 1: Clustering of buffel-
grass observations in Arizona
made by USA-NPN staff and vol-
unteers.for example, address the problem of buffelgrass site detection
using UA Vs and satellite imagery. Other prior work has also
examined detecting unobserved buffelgrass sites using remote
imagery, but does not explicitly model the readiness of those sites
for herbicidal treatment [7, 2, 16].
Green-up prediction requires phenological observations. A pri-
mary source of observations is the USA National Phenology
Network (USA-NPN), a national-scale monitoring and research
initiative focused on collecting research-grade phenological data,
information, and forecasts [ 4]. USA-NPN offers a “Buffelgrass
Pheno Forecast,” which currently uses the baseline accumulated
precipitation model based on thresholding [ 29] and forecasts 50%
green up at 4km resolution across the state of Arizona [ 8]. Ad-
ditionally, USA-NPN facilitates the collection of high-quality ob-
servations of plant and animal life cycle stages through Nature’s
Notebook , a freely available phenology citizen science platform
and dataset used by thousands of volunteer and professional sci-
entists. Buffelgrass is one of over 1,700 species participants can
observe at locations of their choosing [24].
3 Methodology
Datasets We leverage three distinct sources of data. First, we use volunteer contributed buffelgrass
phenology observations (e.g. green-up percentage ≥%50) from hundreds of unique locations,
gathered using USA-NPN’s Nature’s Notebook platform. Second, we gather climate data from
ERA5-Land , which is a reanalysis dataset with 50 land variables spanning several decades [ 18]. Of
these variables, we selected 16 variables for experimentation based on domain expertise; they are
listed in Table 2 in the appendix. Third, we utilize satellite images provided by PlanetAPI2, which
offers higher-resolution (3.7 meters per pixel) than standard public domain satellite imagery like
Sentinel. A more detailed dataset description as well as our training practices (hyper-parameters, data
splits, etc.) can be found in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 respectively in the appendix.
Model 1: Accumulative Precipitation Baseline (AP) A standard, science-backed, heuristic method
for predicting buffelgrass phenology, the Accumulative Precipitation model ( AP) simply calculates
the total amount of precipitation over the past 24 days [ 29]. If this accumulative precipitation exceeds
1.7 inches, buffelgrass is likely to have a greenness level exceeding 50%. This method is currently
deployed by USA-NPN [8].
Model 2: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) TheAPmodel may fail to capture sequential long-
term patterns or dependencies effectively, and does not incorporate other environmental variables
directly [ 29]. We theorized that the LSTM [ 12] architecture would be well-suited for modeling the
correlation between buffelgrass greenness and patterns in weather during the days leading up to

observation, as LSTMs have been shown to be effective at modeling temporal patterns in climate data
[23]. Our experiments use LSTMs with two different input sequences: LSTM (single) only utilizes a
sequence of precipitation values as input, to be more directly comparable to the APmodel. On the
otherhand, LSTM (multi) takes input from a sequence of many external climate feature values in
addition to precipitation values (listed in Table 2 in Appendix).
Figure 2: Four 90×90
meter patches, each cen-
tered at a buffelgrass ob-
servation site.Model 3: Vision Transformer (ViT) The Vision Transformer ( ViT),
as introduced in [ 6], is a model primarily designed for image classi-
fication tasks. It adopts a Transformer-like architecture that operates
on image patches. In our work, we fine-tuned the pre-trained model
google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k using PlanetAPI data.
Model 4: Multi-Modal LSTM+ViT TheLSTM models are designed
to process sequential features, while the ViT model excels at making
predictions based on spatial information derived from satellite images.
Recognizing the potential for these two modalities to enhance each other’s
performance when combined, we adopt a multi-modal approach, which
has been shown to capture non-overlapping signal and improve climate
models [ 13]. Specifically, we leverage the ViTmodel to generate embed-
dings from satellite images. These embeddings are then concatenated with
the sequential embeddings derived from external features with LSTM . A
final linear layer then yields predictions.
4 Results and Discussion
Neural Models Outperform Simple AP Model The prediction results are presented in Table 1.
Note that all of the neural models exhibit better performance compared to the simple accumulative
precipitation model (AP). Explicitly modeling temporal precipitation patterns alone is enough for
a significant boost, as even LSTM (single) demonstrates a notable enhancement in accuracy (13%
points↑), F1 (0.26 ↑) over the AP model. With added variables, the LSTM (multi) achieves the best
accuracy, F1, and false negative rate of all models, with smaller standard deviations, underscoring the
importance of temporal features and other climate variables in modeling this task.
TheViTmodel, relying solely on satellite imagery, also improves over APin accuracy (6% points ↑),
F1 (0.18 ↑), and false positive rate (7% ↓). Despite beating AP, the ViT model underperformed the
LSTM models. We believe this is for two reasons: (1) the observation-date-only satellite imagery
lacks necessary temporal features and (2) the quality of the satellite images matters, but varies among
the images obtained from the PlanetAPI . At our current pixel resolution (1 pixel ≈3.7 meters), it is
hard to detect the shapes and edges of buffelgrass (which often occurs in small clumps <10×10
meters), spatial features that are usually helpful in image classification tasks. Furthermore, some
images are distorted by artifacts of the satellite collection process, containing pure random noise (e.g.,
white/black pixels). Combining both ViT andLSTM yields results that surpass ViT alone but fall
slightly short of the performance achieved by LSTM (multi) . Despite this, we are excited by the
potential for multi-modal modeling in this domain – see Figures 7and 8 in the appendix for an in depth
discussion. With higher quality satellite imagery (such as from the Pleiades mission) and full temporal
cover (i.e. images for each day leading up to observation), we believe that multi-modal models will
eventually outperform LSTM (multi) . As it stands, this imagery is prohibitively expensive, but we
hope to gain access to a higher volume and quality of satellite imagery in future project iterations.
Feature Importance and Sensitivity Analysis We analyze our highest performing model, LSTM
(multi) , with the caveat that neural networks are inherently difficult to interpret [ 33]. Our primary

analysis centers on model sensitivity – procedural perturbations of training samples to elicit model
behavior [ 26]. Informally, our sensitivity analysis goes as follows: (1) for model Mand for training
sample x, determine mean value µkfor feature k, (2) create x′, which is a copy of xwhere the value
of feature kinxis set to µk(3) compute absolute difference |M(x)−M(x′)|. We split our data into
classes based on the confusion matrix to further clarify patterns [ 25]. In Figures 4 and 5, we show
complete sensitivity results on LSTM (multi) . In Figure 3 we then aggregate and z-normalize results
across all samples to look for global patterns; see Section 7 in the appendix for more analysis.
Resource Savings, Deployment and Impact Many organizations use the USA-NPN’s Buffelgrass
Pheno Forecast maps to shape treatment efforts, including Pima County and the US Forest Service.
These organizations manage multiple geographically diverse properties spread across southern
Arizona, and green-up prediction tools shape costly crew deployments on any given day.
Models like LSTM (multi) can dramatically improve crew deployment accuracy, specifically because
they reduce false positive predictions over AP. False positives are especially problematic; situations
where crews are dispatched to a location but the buffelgrass is not sufficiently green for treatment
wastes hundreds of dollars in crew time and vehicle fuel [ 9]. False negatives are increased slightly by
the neural based models, but that is more manageable because the window for herbicidal treatment
(to prevent ripe seed production) is a few weeks. Model reruns with updated climate or imagery data
would then still hope to turn false negatives into true positives as the phenocycle matures.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we tackle the problem of predicting the greenness of buffelgrass, aiming to reduce
wildfire risk and protect biodiversity. We construct deep neural models that can leverage temporal
information from climate features and spatial information from satellite images. Our experimental
results show that: (1) neural models improve significantly over the currently deployed heuristic
prediction models and (2) LSTMs with temporal climate features had the strongest predictive power
of the models we tested. As satellite imagery coverage and resolution improves, one day we hope to
deploy indirect climate based models alongside direct observation of greenness. For now, climate
based LSTM models offer strong performance and smooth daily implementation; they are a new
standard in buffelgrass green-up prediction models.

76.2 Datasets
Prediction Data : Our phenological prediction data actually comprises data from two similar sources:
•Nature’s Notebook Observation Data : V olunteer participants have contributed buffelgrass
phenology observations at hundreds of unique locations using the USA-NPN’s Nature’s Note-
book platform. Nature’s Notebook is designed to encourage repeated observations on the same
individual plants over the growing season, ideally capturing green-up, flowering, seed ripening,
and senescence. Individual observations consist of observation location (longitude and latitude),
elevation, phenological status (whether the plant is green or not; whether the plant is flowering or
not; whether fruits are present; etc.) as well as the intensity or abundance of present phenophases
(if the plant is green, how much of the plant is green?) on a single date. The nature’s notebook
observations include 1,698 distinct location ×date observations in total. According to standard
practices described in Gerst et al. [8], we reclassified greenness reports observations as: 1 if
greenness exceeds 50%; 0 otherwise.
•Local One-Time Observation Data : Because buffelgrass is highly invasive, the plants are
often removed when observed, rendering repeated phenological observations within the Nature’s
Notebook platform impossible. Accordingly, in 2019, the USA-NPN created an online form
through which professionals and volunteers treating buffelgrass could report the instantaneous
phenological status of buffelgrass plants. These “one-time” observations are primarily used by the
USA-NPN to validate existing Pheno Forecast maps. The format of this data matches Nature’s
Notebook observations, and we follow the same greenness reclassifying procedure, providing us
with an additional 194 observations.
Google Earth — ERA5-Land Data : To improve predictions, we use external climate or weather
features that may correlate with buffelgrass greenness. ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset that
furnishes data on 50 land variables spanning several decades at a higher resolution than the original
ERA5 dataset [ 18]. For more comprehensive information regarding this dataset, readers are directed
to [19]. For each entry in the Nature’s Notebook dataset, we obtain external feature values from a
period starting at the observation date and extending back 24 days. We have selected 16 variables for
experimentation, and these are listed in Table 2.
Planet Satellite Images : As discussed, several studies [ 22,7] have previously employed satellite
imagery to detect the presence of buffelgrass. In contrast, our research focuses on a different task,
which is to predict the greenness of buffelgrass using high-resolution satellite images. To facilitate
this endeavor, we utilize high-resolution satellite images provided by Planet3, which offer a resolution
of 3.7 meters. For each data record, we extract satellite images centered around the observation
location point, corresponding to the observation date. Each image has the dimension of 369×369.
6.3 Training
By combining all our prediction data sources, we were left with 987 observations to experiment with
(some observations did not have accompanying satellite imagery from PlanetAPI , as they predate
the launch of the mission in 2016). We initially divided the 987 observations into a training set
comprising 798 observations and a test set consisting of 198 observations. We then conducted a
5-fold cross-validation procedure on the training set to develop our models. To gauge the variability
in model performance, we calculated the standard deviation across the 5 folds.
For the APmodel, there is no training needed. For the LSTM models, they are composed of two
LSTM layers with a hidden dimension of 128, and a linear layer for prediction. During training,
the batch size is set to 4, the learning rate to 1e-4, and the number of training epochs to 500. The
ViT model is trained with a batch size of 2, a learning rate of 1e−5, and it undergoes 10 training
epochs. The LSTM+ViT model is trained with a batch size of 4, a learning rate of 1e−5for 100
training epochs. In all cases, a consistent random seed of 816 is employed for model training to
ensure reproducibility and consistency in results.

87 Sensitivity Analysis
Below we provide sensitivty analysis figures for LSTM (multi) across every feature. Every point in
each plot represents a sample in our training data, and is color coded by the confusion matrix class of
the prediction that sample received by the LSTM (multi) model. You may immediately note that
theLSTM (multi) model does not produce calibrated predictions i.e. the predictions are not true
probabilities ∈[0,1], though we do threshold by 0.5. In our case, we found that taking extra steps
to calibrate the model reduced model performance, which is common for deep learning models and
complex architectures [11]. Thus, it is better to think of the model outputs as likelihood scores.
Here we take a close look at each plot in order, to ascertain feature specific patterns. Note that we
will delineate between sensitivity observations and conjectures about root causes.
•In Figure 4a, we look at the Total Precipitation Sum. This is accumulated liquid and frozen
water like rain and snow, stemming from both large-scale weather patterns and convective
activities, measured in depth (meters) and representing the depth water would have if spread
evenly over a grid box. We note the upward trend in sensitivity among the true positive class
(in blue) as the model predictions get higher. This suggests that higher likelihood green-ups
(i.e. higher model predictions) are especially sensitive to reduced precipitation to the mean.
•In Figures 4b, 4c and 4d, we examine Temperature (at 2 meters), as well as Max and Min
Temperature (at 2 meters) respectively. This is air temperature calculated 2 meters above the
surface of land, sea, or inland waters, modeled considering atmospheric conditions. These
are highly correlated features and thus the trends in their sensitivity are similar: true negative
samples are the most highly sensitive samples to this class. As temperature is correlated
with precipitation and moisture levels, we conjecture that higher temperatures imply more
certainty about no green-up. We further note that this feature had the smallest effects in
aggregate on model predictions (see Figure 6).
•In Figures 4e, 4f and 4g, we analyze the sensitivity of Solar Radiation Downward Sum, Max
and Min respectively. This represents the amount of solar radiation, including both direct
and diffuse, reaching the Earth’s surface, accounting for reflection by clouds and aerosols
and absorption, approximating what would be measured by a pyranometer. Similarly to
temperature, this variable is correlated with precipitation (sun implies no cloud cover, which
implies less moisture). Based on the sensitivity plot, we conjecture that the model primarily
used this variable in determining true negatives.
•In Figures 5a, 5b and 5c, we observe sensitivity of Surface Pressure, Max and Min re-
spectively. This pressure variable, measured in Pascals (Pa), represents the atmospheric
pressure on the surface of land, sea, and inland water, reflecting the weight of the air column
above, and is utilized alongside temperature to determine air density, with mean sea level
pressure commonly used for identifying pressure systems over mountainous areas. We
were surprised by the sensitivity of the model to this variable. However, it is known that
surface pressure is heavily correlated with weather systems, and can independently effect
the rate of plant photosynthesis through disruptions to transpiration [ 27]. Still, we found it
difficult to interpret the effects of this variable, particularly with respect to false positives
and false negatives. We worry that it could be confounding, and may remove it in future
model iterations.
•In Figures 5d, 5e and 5f, we study the sensitivity of Soil Temperature (Level 1), Max and
Min respectively. The temperature of soil in layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) is set at the middle of each
layer, with heat transfer calculated at the interfaces between them, and an assumption of
no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. Most samples were not particularly
sensitive to this variable, where others were. The sensitivities suggests that the max soil
temperature was useful in deciding positive classifications, while the min soil temperature
was useful in negative classifications. The soil temperature likely correlates with water
volume and solar heat, which partially explains the sensitivities.
•In Figure 5g, 5h and 5i, the V olumetric Soil Water (Layer 1), Max and Min is examined.
The volumetric soil water in soil layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) is related to the soil texture, depth, and
the underlying groundwater level, with the surface at 0 cm. Soil water is vital for plant
growth and thus for accurate positive predictions - an upward trend in model likelihood
scores correlated with higher sensitivity is apparent in all three sensitivity plots.

12Figure 7: Understanding the overlapping correctness between our LSTM (multi) andViT models
informed our decision to pursue a multi-modal approach. Above, you can see the overlapping
correctness for the two models, for each class in the confusion matrix. Though both models agree on
at least a plurality of predictions in each case, their predictive correctness does not overlap entirely. In
fact, the types of errors each model makes are vastly different, and suggests to us that non-overlapping
signal might be captured by using an ensemble or multi-modal approach. Though we did not succeed
in creating a multi-modal approach that fully utilized this signal, we believe that future improvements
in green-up accuracy will be dependent on combining direct satellite observation with climate and
other remote sensing data in this way.

Figure 8: To provide a sense of the types of mistakes the ViTmodel makes in particular, we provide
the following patches of satellite imagery, corresponding to confusion matrix sections of the Venn
diagram in Figure 7. You can see that images the ViTmodel “missed” (i.e. false negatives) in relation
to the LSTM (multi) model are almost entirely due to poor image quality or cloud cover. Meanwhile,
unique LSTM true negatives and unique ViT true positives have similar image quality, suggesting
the model is inherently biased towards higher quality images for positive classification. This type of
bias would be ameliorated through the collection of more data and better image cleaning procedures,
as well as higher resolution imagery.
