Abstract
Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail carbon
emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the inherent chal-
lenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead
to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-
swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper
employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy
of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted
to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction
guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment.
Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500
miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning
in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of
implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations,
but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.
1 Introduction
The global challenge of carbon emissions has exhibited different patterns and witnessed various
responses across sectors. In 2021, 21.2% of these emissions are attributed to the transportation
sector ([ 4]). While substantial progress has been made in the electrification of passenger vehicles,
heavy-duty trucks remain notably falling behind in this transition. In contrast, heavy-duty trucks,
though accounting for less than 10% of the total vehicle population, are responsible for more than 40%
of carbon dioxide emissions ([ 7,14,24]). This disparity underscores the opportunity for mitigating
transportation environment impact via the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. In practice, several
factors contribute to the lagging electrification of heavy-duty trucks, chiefly among them are the
limitations in battery size and energy density, range anxiety, and long charging durations. However,
as EV technology advances and battery costs decrease, battery swapping stations are emerging as an
economically viable solution for business proprietors and station operators ([27]).
To take China as an example, state-owned highway companies have shown significant interest in
exploring the commercial potential of establishing battery swapping stations (BSS) specifically for
heavy-duty trucks. These entities, responsible for constructing and overseeing state-owned highways
and associated infrastructure (such as service areas, power stations, and charging stations), posit that
(i) service areas spaced every 50 miles, (ii) combined with swift battery swapping services, and (iii)
electric vehicles’ reduced operational cost per mile (compared with traditional vehicles), can strongly
boost the electrification for heavy-duty trucks.

This work presents a data-driven approach to optimize the operational efficiency of such BSS services.
Our methodology adopts a “predict-then-optimize” pipeline (Figure 1a). Utilizing traffic data of
heavy-duty trucks, we employ spatial-temporal machine learning prediction models to forecast traffic
volume in upcoming hours. Leveraging these predictions, we then solve an integer program to derive
a dynamic scheduling policy for BSS operations. Our work is in collaboration with the Chongqing
Expressway Group Company (CEGC), a key entity in charge of the development and management of
highways in Chongqing, China, a municipality spanning 31,700 square miles (the largest municipality
area in the world) and a population over 32 million.
Our prediction approach is closely related to the literature on machine learning methods for traffic
forecasting. As neural network (NN) methods evolve ([ 8,12,10,21]), NN-based traffic prediction
methods ([ 15,6,26,22]) have become increasing effective. In the traffic prediction literature, there is
also a growing interest in leveraging machine methods for climate-change-related goals ([ 2,18,5,9]).
The predicted traffic volume is used to optimize the operations of BSS, which is related to the vast
literature of planning and management for electric vehicles ([ 13,23,11,17,20]) and energy systems
([25, 16, 3]).
Here we summarize our key findings. From a prediction perspective, based on our dataset, we
observe that the integration of the attention module ([ 21]) enhances the prediction accuracy of the
GCN-based model for longer horizons. In terms of the service rate, compared to the hindsight optimal
strategy where the ground truth is known, our predict-then-optimize approach demonstrates robust
performance across various environments. Our investigation also sheds light on the planning choice
between fixed BSS (a BSS with a fixed location) and mobile BSS (a BSS that can change its location).
We observe that the traffic pattern significantly influences decision-making for infrastructure choices
more than the accuracy of traffic prediction: in the initial phases of implementing battery-swapping
services, the traffic has a more irregular pattern/heteroskedasticity, which favors the mobile BSS; as
the system matures, the traffic has lower variation and more stable pattern, and in this case, the fixed
BSS is more preferred.
2 Data and Methodology
2.1 Data
In collaboration with CEGC, we analyze traffic data for heavy-duty trucks on highways. The traffic
data is captured by cameras mounted on gantries across an expansive network that stretches over
2,500 miles. Positioned roughly every 2 miles, there are more than 1,800 of these structures dotting
the network. As vehicles pass beneath these gantries, the cameras record the precise time and take
images. CEGC subsequently processes these images using computer vision techniques (analyzing the
vehicle’s appearance and its license plate) and thus identifies the vehicle type.
We construct a network topology using data collected over a span of three months (Figure 1b), where
nodes represent service areas designated for the launch of fixed BSS. These service areas also serve
as locations where mobile BSS units operate. Meanwhile, the edges of our topology represent the
highway routes, facilitating the movement of both heavy-duty trucks and mobile BSS.
22.2 Model
Prediction. We employ machine learning models to forecast traffic for heavy-duty trucks on highways.
We focus on short-term predictions and target a window length of the next 6 hours, which is the
time scale for the operations of BSS. The predicted traffic flow then serves as the input to optimize
the operations of BSS. Specifically, we denote Dt={x1,x2,···,xt}the traffic data up to time t,
where xt∈Rmdenote the cumulative traffic on medges during the time interval (t−1, t]. Denoting
fthe machine learning model, and hthe prediction interval, we intend to train fsuch that the output
f(Dt) = [ ˆy1,ˆy2,···,ˆyh]⊤is close to the observed future traffic [xt+1,···,xt+h]⊤. We choose
the following machine learning models for fand aim to investigate the effect of the self-attention
mechanism on traffic prediction tasks.
•Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) ([26]): T-GCN combines the graph
convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to incorporate the spatial
and temporal information to forecast traffic volumes.
•Attention Graph Convolutional Network (A3T-GCN) ([1]): A3T-GCN modifies the T-
GCN by incorporating an attention module to dynamically capture the spatial and temporal
correlations of traffic volumes.
We report the performance of these two methods in Table 3a.
Planning/Optimization. In our setting, the fixed BSS encompasses a battery-swapping booth along
with an adjacent inventory house dedicated to charging and storing batteries. The mobile BSS is a
sizable truck equipped with a battery-swapping module and storage module (the storage module is
also capable of charging). Since the traffic of heavy-duty trucks is highly non-stationary, the mobile
BSS offers such flexibility when the demand at certain locations surges. By carefully dispatching
spare batteries between service areas, mobile BSS can effectively match the temporally and spatially
varying demands for battery swaps.
Now we describe a scheduling optimization model that dispatches these mobile batteries among
service areas. In our highway network, the travel time for heavy-duty trucks between adjacent battery
swapping stations (approximately 40 miles) is approximately 1 hour. As of the year 2023, one 282
kWh battery for heavy-duty trucks also takes roughly 1 hour to get fully charged with an ultra-fast
charger ([ 19]). Henceforth, we discretize time into hourly intervals, with a unit time step representing
1 hour. The optimization model needs to decide whether each mobile BSS should remain at the
current station or be dispatched and relocated to a nearby station. If the latter option is adopted, the
model needs to further decide the number of batteries to dispatch. The moving battery on the way
cannot be used for service until it arrives at the destination.
In our optimization model, the objective is to minimize the total lost demand over the horizon. At
timet, the decision is made based on [x1,···,xt,ˆy1,···,ˆyh]T. Although the algorithm looks into
the future and makes multi-step planning, we re-optimize the algorithm at every time step based on
the new information Dt+1and the prediction f(Dt+1). We refer to Appendix A for details of the
formulation and definitions.
We note that in this work, we assume all the trucks are electric trucks for simplicity but without loss
of generality. Note that the goal of our analysis is to provide guidance for infrastructure planners to
facilitate the electrification process, and this assumption helps circumvent the classic chicken-and-egg
dilemma: full electrification demands robust infrastructure, but investing heavily in such infrastructure
is not feasible unless there is a significant presence of electric trucks. However, the acquisition of
these electric trucks presents a hefty upfront cost for logistic business owners.
3 Results
Prediction accuracy. Table 3a compares the forecasting accuracy of T-GCN and A3T-GCN on the
test set. T-GCN performs better for traffic prediction for the next 2hours, and A3T-GCN performs
better for traffic prediction for the next 3-5 hours. Our hypothesis is that the self-attention module
makes the future prediction sequences more adaptive, resulting in better performance in a longer
forecasting window. A visualization of our predictions against actual traffic is presented in Figure 3b.

Prediction-based optimization. In Figure 4a, we compute the lost demand on the test set, under the
setting where the ratio of total batteries from fixed BSS v.s. from mobile BSS is 7 : 3. We report the
performance of two ML-based scheduling policies when the total inventory of batteries is high (90%
of the average), medium (75% of the average), and low (60% of the average). We find that these two
methods perform similarly: both ML approaches feature a lost demand that is within 109% of the
lost demand of the oracle policy (the one that solves the optimization problem in a hindsight manner
with the actual future traffic). The scheduling policy based on T-GCN consistently outperforms the
A3T-GCN-based policy with a margin of around 2%across all inventory levels. Our hypothesis is
that compared with the longer prediction length (h >2), T-GCN features better accuracy for the
shorter prediction length (h≤2), which is more helpful for the predict-then-optimize pipeline.
In the same environment as above, we then investigate the effect of the prediction length hon the
final performance of the scheduling policy. The scheduling policy (except for the oracle policy)
takes{x1,···,xt,ˆy1,···,ˆyh}as input to make decision, and we vary hto see the effect on the
lost demand. According to Figure 4b, we find that for all scheduling policies (including the oracle
policy), the larger the h, the lower the lost demand. This indicates that although the prediction on
longer horizon is less accurate, it has positive effect on improving the performance of the scheduling
policy. Lastly, see Figure 6 for visualization for the scheduling policy where mobile BSS tries to
catch demand.
Fixed BSS vs mobile BSS. Lastly, we discuss the choice between deploying fixed BSS and mobile
BSS. CEGC intends to launch the battery swapping service on selected highway routes, targeting
contracts with logistics companies that own truck fleets operating between industrial areas. As a result,
during the early stages, electric truck’s traffic volume is likely to exhibit peaks that are distinct from
the peaks of the cumulative traffic volume of trucks. This ushers in a different pattern to our existing
traffic dataset. To simulate these nonstationary structural patterns in the early stage of electrification,
we randomly select various nodes (service stations), and for their adjacent edges (routes), we advance
the traffic volume along the time axis, ensuring that traffic peaks are altered (see Figure 5).
In Figure 2, we evaluate the lost demand of the T-GCN-based scheduling model under different
fixed BSS to mobile BSS ratios and different degrees of traffic shift. We find that when there is
no traffic shift (this corresponds to the situation with full electrification of heavy-duty trucks), the
oracle policy improves moderately as the ratio of mobile BSS increases. However, the prediction
error of ML hinders the performance of both ML-based scheduling policies, resulting an increased
lost demand. When there is a large amount of traffic shift (this corresponds to the early stage
of electrification), both ML-based scheduling policies show a considerable amount of increases
in performance. The managerial insight is that two factors favor the adoption of mobile BSS: (i)
irregular patterns of the traffic volume and (ii) high accuracy of the demand prediction model. If
there is a large improvement in the prediction accuracy, mobile BSS is very effective even when the
full electrification of heavy-duty trucks happens.

6A Details for the Optimization Model
We schedule these mobile batteries in a rolling manner: in each time step, we solve the optimization
problem to obtain a scheduling plan for the next Thours, but only the scheduling plan for the current
(first) time step is executed. We assume that there is a sufficient number of trucks serving as mobile
BSS, ensuring that at every time step, we can deliver any battery in the mobile BSS to any nearby
stations. We outline our model in model (1) associated with notations defined in Table 1.
