Abstract
The number of standardized policy documents regarding climate policy and their
publication frequency is significantly increasing. The documents are long and
tedious for manual analysis, especially for policy experts, lawmakers, and citizens
who lack access or domain expertise to utilize data analytics tools. Potential conse-
quences of such a situation include reduced citizen governance and involvement in
climate policies and an overall surge in analytics costs, rendering less accessibility
for the public. In this work, we use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based pipeline
for the automatic summarization and analysis of 10-years of national energy and
climate plans (NECPs) for the period from 2021 to 2030, established by 27 Member
States of the European Union. We focus on analyzing policy framing, the language
used to describe specific issues, to detect essential nuances in the way governments
frame their climate policies and achieve climate goals. The methods leverage topic
modeling and clustering for the comparative analysis of policy documents across
different countries. It allows for easier integration in potential user-friendly appli-
cations for the development of theories and processes of climate policy. This would
further lead to better citizen governance and engagement over climate policies and
public policy research.
1 Introduction
Machine learning (ML) systems have already been used to analyze climate change [ 15]. They are
able to follow climate change itself as well as develop and evaluate solutions preventing or even
reversing the process. ML in the form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has also started to be
implemented to study discussions around climate change and climate policies [ 18]. It has also been

presented in this paper is a part of the latter strand of research. It aims to develop NLP methods
dedicated to analyzing specific types of policy documents – highly standardized national climate
strategies and reports.
In recent years, as the danger of climate change has become acknowledged by public opinion,
policymakers, and politicians, the number of policy documents dedicated to climate policy has been
steadily increasing (Appendix A). However, after the introduction of the Paris Agreement, a specific
group of documents has started to be produced by national governments of the Member States of
the European Union (EU) – climate strategies and reports on implementing these strategies. The
Agreement (Article 13) established an Enhanced Transparency Framework design to provide guidance
for regular reporting on national climate policies. As a consequence, the Agreement has stimulated
the development of policy documents having similar structures as they address previously agreed
issues. Those documents have been analyzed so far mainly through the perspective of climate policy
indicators showing commitments of national governments to limit climate change [8, 6].
In this study, we propose the pipeline (Figure 3) that focuses on different aspects of these documents
– the way they frame climate policy. The issue framing has been found to influence policy dynamics
over the long run [ 5]. The similar structure of the documents allows us to compare the policy framing
in different dimensions separately, which allows for a more fine-grained analysis of policy frames.
The pipeline was created based on two assumptions: (1) the number and publishing frequency of
standardized documents regarding climate policy will soon increase significantly; (2) NLP methods
allow a relatively quick and comprehensive summary of these documents and their comparison. They
can also reveal important nuances in how governments frame their climate policies.
The main contributions of our work are as follows:
1.We propose a pipeline for analyzing similarly structured documents regarding climate public
policy, leveraging Natural Language Processing.
2. We provide an easy-to-use web application for exploring structured results of our pipeline.
2 Data
We analyze the 10-year national energy and climate plans (NECPs) for the period from 2021 to 2030
established by 27 Member States of the EU. These documents contain information on how individual
countries want to relate to the EU’s critical energy and climate policy dimensions. Each plan was
published in English and the country’s national language on the EU’s official website. Only documents
written in English were considered in this study. All of the data and information used in the paper,
either as a subject of the analysis or to support its claims, are publicly available on this website.
To ensure the parallelism of the plans between the Member States, NECPs had to follow a unified
structure facilitating comparison and aggregation. According to the template, five Energy Union
dimensions and five sections should be distinguished. See Appendix C for more details.
We performed preprocessing of all documents; a detailed description of this process is available in
Appendix D.
3 Methodology
Topic modeling For modeling topics, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [ 1] as it
assumes each document is a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics, which is in line with the
assumptions of our study.
Modeling was carried out using the Gensim package [ 13] separately on seven sub-datasets – five
defined by Energy Union dimensions and two related to subsections where these dimensions were
not distinguished. In addition, words were filtered to include only those appearing in at least four
analyzed texts, which translates into the presence of words in documents submitted by at least two
different countries. Such filtering ensures that texts are not grouped based upon expressions unique
to each country yet unrelated to the document’s topic.
2We assumed that prior over topic-word distribution may be asymmetric and it was matched automat-
ically based on the subcorpora. For selecting the parameters describing the symmetric prior over
document-topic distribution ( αparameter in Gensim LDA), we performed two grid searches. We
observed that choosing the correct number of topics is more important than choosing the optimal α.
However, models gave more intuitive and interpretable results for α∈ {50,100,150,200,250}. The
performance of such parameter values is probably explained by the fact that considered documents are
similar in terms of topics and differ only in nuances. We assessed the quality of topic modeling using
two coherence measures, CV [ 14] and UMass [ 9]. Moreover, we manually analyzed and validated
the results, which is necessary to obtain semantically meaningful topics [3].
Topic interpretation One of the most challenging aspects of topic modeling is the characterization
of the topics learned by the used model [ 12]. Topics obtained using LDA do not have an interpretable
description, but usually, the most common words are used to describe topics. We used the 25 most
popular words for automatic topic naming using GPT-3 [2].
However, such a representation does not give the complete picture and can even be misleading,
as each topic is a distribution over the entire vocabulary. Therefore, we used the LDAvis tool
[17] to characterize and interpret the topics. This interactive method provides a global overview
of the topics and illustrates how they differ. At the same time, it allows for a scrutinous examination
of the terms most associated with each topic. Precisely, two metrics were used in the topic analysis
and description process: the saliency metric [ 4] used to identify the most informative words, and
the relevance metric [ 17] used to rank words within topics and identify the most relevant terms. Based
on this exploration and automatic suggestions, we made the final naming of topics.
Comparison of policy frames mixture among countries In the analysis, we used similarity
measures computed in terms of similarity of distributions described directly for the LDA model [ 16].
We select an information radius measure (also known as Jensen-Shannon divergence).
We examined the dependencies between the topic mixtures of individual countries by grouping them
with a hierarchical clustering algorithm. An agglomerative approach with an average linkage criterion
was used. The choice of this clustering procedure was due to the fact that it produces a complete
dendrogram showing the range of levels at which countries are related. Thus, it presents a more
holistic picture of the agendas’ underlying structure than other methods that return a single version
of clustering. In addition, we used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [ 21]
to visualize the results of clustering.
We examined how the clusters of countries differ across dimensions. This has a twofold purpose.
First, it allows us to validate the clustering and topics against the expert knowledge of well-established
countries’ alliances, such as the Visegrad Group. Secondly, it allows us to pinpoint other, non-obvious
groups of countries with matching or similar policy framings. This creates an opportunity to provide
new hypotheses for further geopolitical and climate studies.

space are based on t-SNE embedding.Web application for exploration of
the results The result of topic mod-
eling are the distributions of top-
ics in each analyzed text. Matrices
composed of these vectors for each
of the seven models are the direct re-
sult of the modeling process, and they
can be analyzed in a variety of ways.
Thus, we have prepared a demo ver-
sion of the web application that en-
ables in-depth, interactive exploration
on many levels, see Appendix E. First,
it is possible to examine the distribu-
tion of topics for the selected country
and compare them between sections
(Figure 5) or juxtapose them with the
3overall results for other countries (Figure 6). Further, the application allows for clustering based on
the found representation (Figure 1). The interpretability of the results is ensured by analysis that
allows the exploration of particular topics through their keywords (Table 1). Another feature is the
ability to compare the values for topics with external variables (Figure 8).
Differences between sections across dimensions The modeling results can also be used for other,
more sophisticated analyses, such as comparisons between National objective and targets andPolicies
and measures sections to detect inconsistencies in agendas. It turns out that some states have more
discrepancies and that this phenomenon is more typical for some dimensions, see Appendix G.
Policy frames focus for countries We find there are 5 policy frames for Decarbonization and
Energy efficiency , 3 policy frames for Energy security ,Internal market , and R&I and Competitiveness .
Overall, our system detects 19 policy frames across all dimensions. A full list of policy frames is
available in Appendix F. By analyzing the topics’ distribution, we conclude which country focuses
on which policy frame in each of the dimensions. As an example, we can see that Bulgaria is the
country that devotes the most parts of the Decarbonization section to the Greenhouse gas emission ,
(.65 topic probability). Netherlands is an outlier in the topic Sustainable transport , with .45 topic
probability (Figure 9).
Co-occurrence in clusters across dimensions We have analyzed countries’ co-occurrences in the
same clusters. Three pairs of countries are in the same groups in all five dimensions mentioned earlier:
Netherlands and Austria, Malta and Cyprus, Estonia and Finland. It may suggest that these countries
frame issues similarly in all areas. France seems to be the most isolated country, co-occurrence only
once with Belgium, Spain, Romania, and Slovenia. One reason explaining this could be that France
has the most nuclear energy in their energy mix among other countries.
We have also checked some insights regarding countries’ alliances, e.g. the Visegrad Group, consisting
of Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia (Figure 12a). In our analysis, there is one dimension,
Energy efficiency , in which all countries belong to the same cluster. In others, they are split into two
clusters. What is worth seeing is that Poland and Hungary jointly appear in Decarbonization ,Energy
efficiency , and Energy security dimensions. Czechia and Slovakia are together in Decarbonization ,
Energy efficiency ,R&I and Competitiveness .
Another interesting group is the Nordic countries (Figure 12b). In Internal market all countries are
in one cluster. In other categories, Denmark and Finland differ only in R&I and Competitiveness .
Figure 11 shows the full co-occurrence matrix.
5 Conclusion
Climate change is one of the most critical global threats. Creating public policies regarding this matter
is essential in counteracting this problem. However, the creation of the policy itself is insufficient
without the actions undertaken by the citizens and policymakers as a result. This is why our system
allows for quick analysis of the focus of each national plan, comparing multiple countries across
different dimensions, and detecting alignment between countries in policy framing. We believe that
this could benefit the public understanding of the landscape of climate plans in the EU.
Our method and pipeline can also be used to analyze other kinds of similarly structured policy
documents, not only related to climate change. One of the documents that can be run through
our framework in the future is a progress report produced by each Member State every two years
regarding the changes they introduce as a result of their NECP.
This work can be seen as a first step in developing methods for automated analysis of climate policies.
In the future, such methods could allow tracking of how those policies change over time and how
they relate to changes in the economic factors of countries, such as the energy mix.

6A Number of public policies regarding climate change
There are multiple databases containing public policies. The biggest of them is Overton.io database
[20]. We have used query climate change to check the number of public policies available. We got
322012 documents from 171 countries. Most of them was published by USA (81643), Intergovern-
mental Organizations (61884), United Kingdom (55393), and EU (40480). We have counted policies
published each year, the results are shown in Figure 2. As we can see, the number of documents is
rapidly growing.

7C Structure of National energy and climate plans
The creation of a template for National energy and climate plans has been guaranteed by the
Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union
and Climate Action [10]. The diagram of the structure of the documents is presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4: Structure of National Energy and Climate Plans provided by the European Commission.
There are five Energy Union dimensions:
1.Decarbonisation ,
2.Energy efficiency ,
3.Energy security ,
4.Internal market ,
5.R&I and Competitiveness .
There are also five sections:
1.Overview and Process for Establishing the Plan ,
2.National Objectives and Targets ,
3.Policies and Measures ,
4.Current Situation and Reference Projections ,
5.Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures .
The dimensions are well separated in sections (2)-(4), while the remaining sections constitute separate
entities. It should be noted that there are discrepancies in the documents in relation to this structure.
In particular, in the Impact Assessment of Policies and Measures section, dimensions have not been
explicitly separated.
8D Text preparation
We used a well-defined structure of documents to create the corpus. First, we created a script that
extracts the texts based on the table of contents. Then, since not every country strictly adhered
to the imposed structure, we manually validated the results and corrected errors in problematic files.
Ultimately, by creating separate records for each dimension in each subsection, the corpus of 453
documents were constructed. We applied a set of preprocessing steps to the prepared corpus with
tools and models available in the spaCy package [ 7]. We performed tokenization, lemmatization and
added bigrams and trigrams to unigrams with the aim to improve the topic modeling and streamline
topic interpretation.
E Web application for exploration of the results
We present the process of examining the results obtained for Decarbonisation dimension since it
is, on average, the longest and most comprehensive part of the documents. For this dimension, we
obtained five notably contrasting main topics presented in Table 1 along with the corresponding
keywords.

The web application also allows for grouping countries with similar topic distributions in a selected
dimension or section. Hierarchical clustering (selected for analysis in this study), HDBSCAN, or K-
means algorithm can be used for this purpose. For dimensions (covered in three sections), clusterings
are based on bound and normalized topic distributions. The result for the Decarbonization dimension
in the form country grouping is shown in Figure 1. Distance threshold implying specific grouping
was selected on the basis of the analysis of dendrogram and matrix of similarities between countries’
agendas which are presented in Figure 7.

dimension. On the left side of the matrix, there is a dendrogram that visualizes the result of a
hierarchical clustering calculation. The colors in the column preceding the matrix indicate the clusters
in which individual countries appear on the basis of the selected distance threshold (country names
are in the rows), see Figure 1.
11One of the key system features is the possibility of comparing the obtained topics (policy frames)
with external variables in order to detect/clarify the dependencies. We examined the correlations with
objectives, targets, and contributions under the Governance Regulation [10].
The values were drawn from assessments of NECPs made by the European Commission. National
targets and contributions values are precisely specified for 2020 and 2030. There are five different
distinguished categories:
•greenhouse – a binding target for greenhouse gas emissions reductions compared to 2005
under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR);
•renewable energy – national target/contribution for renewable energy: share of energy
from renewable sources in the gross final consumption of energy;
•primary energy – national contribution for energy efficiency: primary energy consump-
tion;
•final energy – national contribution for energy efficiency: final energy consumption;
•electricity – level of electricity interconnectivity.

three sections (vertical axis; the section names are abbreviated for simplicity) and objectives extracted
from the European Commission’s individual assessments of NECPs (horizontal axis).
12F Policy frames
In the process of topic modeling, we have obtained the topics that may be seen as policy frames for
Energy Union dimensions (Table 2).
Table 2: Topics obtained for each Energy Union dimension.
Dimension Topics
Decarbonisation 1.1 Sustainable transport
1.2 GHG emissions
1.3 National energy policy
1.4 Renewable energy sources
1.5 All developments
Energy efficiency 2.1 Financial aspects
2.2 Energy efficiency scenarios
2.3 Saving energy
2.4 Energy renovation
2.5 Primary and final energy
Energy security 3.1 Fossil fuels supply chain
3.2 Energy import
3.3 Capacity market development
Internal market 4.1 Natural gas
4.2 Development and support
4.3 Energy poverty alleviation
R&I and Competitiveness 5.1 Research innovations
5.2 Financial aspects
5.3 Initiatives and programmes
Topic names for the final analysis were given manually, based on obtained keywords (see Appendix
E). Getting those topics was essential to see in which areas countries differ. The plot below shows an
example of such analysis for the Decarbonisation dimension.

13G Differences between sections across dimensions
For the five Energy Union dimensions mentioned in all sections, we check the differences in the
policy agendas for individual countries between the National Objectives and Targets andPolicies
and Measures sections. This analysis aims to show that there are notable disparities between the
sections describing objectives and policies intended for achieving them. We calculate dissimilarities
using the information radius measure applied to pairs of topic distributions for the corresponding
documents from the corpus. For each dimension, we divide the obtained measures by the number of
policy frames to account for their variable cardinality.
We can see that there are countries where these differences are more pronounced, e.g. dissimilarities
for Belgium in 4 out of 5 dimensions are higher than the average for all countries. The dimension
with the greatest inconsistencies between the sections is Decarbonization . On the other hand, on
average, framing policies is the most consistent in the area related to R&I and Competitiveness .

Figure 10: Normalized dissimilarities (expressed as an information radius) between agendas of
theObjectives and Targets andPolicies and Measures sections for all countries and Energy Union
dimensions. The greater the dissimilarity value, the less homogeneity there is between the topics
covered in those sections. The colored lines show the average distance values for each dimension.
14H Co-occurrence in clusters across dimensions
For all countries, we have checked which countries are together across all dimensions; by doing that,
we wanted to check which countries often group. The result of this analysis is shown in Figure 11.
We have also checked some known groups: the Visegrad Group and Nordic countries, to check if
some political alliances or geographical location factor into clustering. As we can see in Figure 12,
there are visible similarities in clusters in both cases.

for five Energy Union dimensions. We see several Member States being clustered together in all the
dimensions, which suggests that they discuss different policy frames similarly.
