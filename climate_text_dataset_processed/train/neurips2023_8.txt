Abstract
Fusing abundant satellite data with sparse ground measurements constitutes a
major challenge in climate modeling. To address this, we propose a strategy to
augment the training dataset by introducing unlabeled satellite images paired with
pseudo-labels generated through a spatial interpolation technique known as ordinary
kriging, thereby making full use of the available satellite data resources. We show
that the proposed data augmentation strategy helps enhance the performance of the
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) model by a
reasonable amount, resulting in a noteworthy improvement in spatial correlation
and a reduction in prediction error.
1 Introduction
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 µmor smaller
(PM 2.5) is is extensively recognized for increasing the risk of a variety of health problems such as
stroke [ 1,2], respiratory diseases [ 3], and ischemic heart disease [ 1,4]. Accurate estimation and
prediction of ground-level PM 2.5concentrations are critical initial steps for subsequent epidemi-
ological investigations into its health impacts. In recent years, advancements in satellite sensing
techniques have enabled researchers to construct a high-resolution spatial mapping of PM 2.5using
machine learning models, in conjunction with ground measurements (e.g. PM 2.5, PM 10, temperature,
humidity, etc.) acquired from air quality monitoring (AQM) stations [5–7]. However, in most cases,
the satellite-based data is much more abundant compared to ground measurements, resulting in a
large amount of unlabeled satellite data (i.e., satellite images at locations without a paired ground
measurement). To elaborate, satellites have the capacity to cover entire urban areas and a majority of
suburban regions of a city within a 24-hour window. In contrast, measurements from ground stations
are only representative within their immediate vicinity, which we refer to as the “area of interest"
(AOI). In most cases, the combined AOI of all ground stations is sparse compared to area covered by
the satellite.
To address the aforementioned limitation, we come up with an approach to make full use of the
unlabeled satellite data and effectively integrate them with ground measurements. Specifically, we
propose to pair the unlabeled satellite data with pseudo-labels of ground measurements generated
by a spatial interpolation method known as ordinary kriging and then augment the labeled dataset
using these paired instances. In this study, we adopt the convolutional neural network-random
forest (CNN-RF) model from Zheng et al. [6]. Our experimental results demonstrate the substantial
advantages gained from this kriging-based augmentation, including decent reduction in errors and
improvement in spatial correlation.

ground-level PM 2.5along with 3 meteorological attributes: sea level pressure (SLP), temperature
(T), and relative humidity (RH). We first create a spatial mapping of interpolated measurements
for the entire area of study using ordinary kriging . Then we pair unlabeled satellite images with
corresponding interpolated measurements based on their geographical coordinates. Namely, each
final data point with pseudo labels consists of 5 components: satellite image, interpolated SLP, T, RH,
and PM 2.5measurements.

Kriging The theoretical basis of kriging, alternatively known as Gaussian process (GP) regression,
was developed by Georges Matheron [ 8]. Within geostatistics models, kriging serves as a spatial
interpolation method where each data point is treated as a sample from a stochastic process [ 9–11].
It also includes several distinct variants (e.g., ordinary kriging [ 12,13], universal kriging [ 14], co-
kriging [ 14,15], etc.) that are categorized based on the properties of the stochastic process. There
are previous research efforts where kriging is applied to the context of remote sensing and climate
modeling. To elaborate, Zhan et al. [16] developed a random forest-spatiotemporal kriging model
to estimate the daily NO 2concentrations in China from satellite data and geographical covariates.
Wu and Li [17] employed residual kriging to interpolate average monthly temperature using latitude,
longitude, and elevation as input variables. Besides these, researchers also used GPs for interpolation
along with other sequence models [18] or classification models [19] in machine learning.
Fusing Satellite and Ground Data The large gap in data density between satellite observations and
ground measurements is a common phenomenon in the fields of remote sensing and climate modeling,
leading researchers to develop a variety of approaches to address this issue. For instance, Jiang
et al. [20] introduced the spatiotemporal contrastive learning strategy, which involves pre-training
deep learning models using unlabeled satellite images to improve the model performance on ground
measurements. Verdin et al. [21] employed Bayesian kriging to model the ground observations of
rainfall, with the mean parameterized as a linear function of satellite estimates and elevation. In light
of these prior studies, our proposed method shares similarities with both of these approaches.
3 Methods
Our proposed method can be divided into 3 steps. First, we generate pseudo-labels of ground
measurements using ordinary kriging and pair them with unlabeled satellite images. Then we
integrate these satellite images with an existing training dataset containing true ground measurements.
Lastly, we adopt the CNN-RF model from Zheng et al. [6]to train on this augmented training dataset
and compare the performance to the case without introducing pseudo-labels. We will discuss these
steps in detail in the following subsections.
3.1 Pseudo-label Generation
The process of generating pseudo-labels is illustrated in Figure 1, where we use ordinary kriging
with an exponential semivariogram (analogous to the kernel function in GP) to interpolate the ground
measurements over the entire area of study. We prefer kriging over other spatial interpolation methods
because it serves as an optimal linear predictor under the modeling framework, accounting for factors
such as spatial distance, continuity, and data redundancy. A more detailed discussion will be provided
2Figure 2: Filtering rules
for unlabeled satellite images.
To be included in the training
dataset, an unlabeled image
must not be located within
the AOI of any AQM sta-
tion and must have at least
Nsensor AQM stations within
its vicinity (defined by a cir-
cular region with a radius of
r). In our experiments, we
setNsensor = 4andr= 0.2.
in Appendix A.1. The parametric form for the exponential semivariogram is presented as follows:
γ(h) =τ2+σ2(1−exp(−ϕh)) ifh >0,
0 otherwise ,(1)
where hstands for the distance between two ground measurements, while τ2,τ2+σ2, and 1/ϕ
represent the nugget, sill, and range parameters, respectively. Concepts and details of semivariogram
will be discussed in Appendix A.2. We choose this particular form due to its superior fit with the
empirical semivariogram compared to other isotropic semivariograms (e.g., Gaussian, spherical, etc.),
as demonstrated in Appendix A.3. Following the generation of pseudo-labels, we pair them with
unlabeled satellite images based on their geographical coordinates. We then blend these pseudo-
labeled images with existing satellite images with true ground measurements to form an augmented
training dataset. It is also possible to include uncertainty during imputation, but we only use the mean
here as prior work shows that high-quality imputations make the biggest impact on performance [ 19].
3.2 Training of CNN-RF Joint Model
With the augmented dataset, we proceed to the phase of model training. We adopt the convolutional
neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) model from a previous study conducted by Zheng et al. [6]
as it demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on the PM 2.5prediction task. Specifically, the RF
learns a preliminary estimation of PM 2.5levels ˆyRFfrom the meterological attributes (i.e., SLP, T,
RH) and the CNN learns a residual ϵ=y−ˆyRFbetween the true PM 2.5labelyand the RF-predicted
PM2.5ˆyRF. The model training phase is divided into two key components: Random Forest (RF) and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The detailed model architecture and hyperparameters can be
found in Figure 2 in Zheng et al. [6].
3.3 Model evaluation
To ensure a direct comparative analysis, we test the effectiveness of our method using the same evalu-
ation metrics adopted by Zheng et al. [6], which include the root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson R), and spatial Pearson correlation
coefficient (spatial Pearson R) as defined as follows:
RMSE =q
1
NPN
i=1(y−ˆy)2, MAE =1
NPN
i=1|y−ˆy| (2)
Pearson R =P(y−¯y)(ˆy−¯ˆy)√P(y−¯y)2P(ˆy−¯ˆy)2, Spatial Pearson R =P(y′−¯y′)(ˆy−¯ˆy)√P(y−¯y)2P(ˆy−¯ˆy)2(3)
where y,ˆyare the true PM 2.5values and predicted PM 2.5values, and ¯y,¯ˆyare the average true PM2.5
values and the average predicted PM 2.5values, Nis number of data points in the test set.

2020. The existing training dataset contains 31,568 satellite images with true ground-level PM 2.5
labels and meteorological attributes obtained from 51 ground AQM stations spanning the National
Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi and its satellite cities such as Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida, etc. We
filter the unlabeled satellite images (i.e., images outside the AOI of AQM stations) as illustrated in
Figure 2. This procedure ensures that each image can be effectively paired with pseudo-labels that
are spatially interpolated using a sufficient amount of surrounding ground measurement data.
4.2 Results
We test the CNN-RF model on datasets containing different number of pseudo-labeled satellite
images and compare them with the baseline case with only true-labeled images (i.e., case with 0
pseudo-labeled images). For each scenario, we repeat the experiment by 10 times and calculate the
average and standrd deviation of the evaluation metrics. As illustrated in Figure 3, our results show
substantial improvements in both prediction accuracy and spatial correlation. Specifically, we observe
a 10.1% reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE), decreasing from 37.64 to 32.56, and a
11.4% decrease in mean absolute error (MAE), dropping from 24.39 to 20.31. Moreover, there is
a 2.8% increase in Pearson’s correlation coefficient (Pearson R) from 0.880 to 0.912, and a 1.8%
increase in spatial Pearson’s correlation coefficient (spatial Pearson R) from 0.878 to 0.907. These
results highlight the substantial benefits gained from the integration of pseudo-labeled images within
the training process.
5 Conclusion
In this research, we introduce a data augmentation approach that involves the incorporation of pseudo-
labeled images into the model training procedure, allowing us to fully leverage the abundancy of
unlabeled satellite images. Our approach involves the generation of pseudo-labeled images through a
two-step process: firstly, applying ordinary kriging on ground measurements to produce pseudo-labels,
and subsequently, pairing these labels with unlabeled images that are carefully selected through a
heuristic criterion, ensuring that each unlabeled image has sufficient spatial information for spatial
interpolation. The results demonstrate that including pseudo-labeled images successfully improve the
state-of-the-art model performance in terms of prediction error and spatial correlation on the test data,
showing the effectiveness of our proposed data augmentation strategy. We expect this strategy to be
useful for various other scenarios in the field of remote sensing and geostatistics.

6A Details of Kriging
A.1 Advantages of Kriging
There are several spatial interpolation methods in the existing geostatistics literature, such as bilinear
interpolation, nearest neighbor, inverse distance weighting (IDW), modified Shepard interpolation
etc. However, all these interpolation methods have certain limitations. Specifically, nearest neighbor
approach gives very poor estimation when the ground stations are sparse. Both IDW and modified
Shepard compute the estimated measurement at a target location as a weighted linear combination
of its neighboring stations, with the weights being a nonlinear function of the distance hbetween
the target location and the neighboring station. A closer station (i.e., with smaller h) typically
receives larger weights. Two commonly used weight functions are the inverse power function
w(h) = 1 /hβand the exponential function w(h) = exp 
−(h/h0)β
where βandh0are pre-
determined parameters.
However, a major drawback of IDW and modified Shepard lies in their failure to account for data
redundancy. For instance, consider a scenario where we have measurements from ground stations
denoted as y1, y2, ..., y m, ym+1, with the measurement we seek to estimate labeled as y0. Let’s
assume that y1, y2, ..., y mare closely clustered together, while ym+1stands alone and further assume
all of the stations, namely y1, y2, ..., y m, ym+1, are equidistant from y0. With IDW or modified
Shepard, {y1, ..., y m}will receive much larger weights as a cluster compared to ym+1. Nevertheless,
in reality, the cluster y1, ..., y mcontributes roughly the same amount of information to the estimation
ofy0asym+1does. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that {y1, ..., y m}should receive similar
weighting as ym+1.
Kriging is a linear estimation method that minimizes the expected squared error, and therefore is also
referred to as the best linear unbiased estimator . To be specific, say we again have measurements
from ground stations denoted as y1, y2, ..., y m, with the measurement we want to estimate labeled as
y0. With Kriging, our estimation is formulated as a linear combination, denoted as ˆy0=Pm
i=1αiyi,
subject to the constraintPm
i=1αi= 1. The determination of the coefficients αiis closely tied to a
function known as the variogram , which will be elaborated in the following section. Compared to
the aforementioned methods, Kriging takes into account spatial distance, spatial continuity, and data
redundancy simultaneously. Consequently, it is the preferred method for our research, as it offers a
more comprehensive approach to spatial estimation.
A.2 Variogram
The variogram can be viewed as a function that describes the correlation between two ground
measurements as a function of the distance hbetween them. Mathematically, the semivariogram,
which is half the value of the variogram, can be expressed by the general formulation as given below:
γ(h) =1
2E[y(s+h)−y(s)]2, (4)
where y(s)andy(s+h)represent the ground measurements at location sands+h, respectively.
Some candidates of variogram include spherical, Gaussian, and exponential, whose functional forms
are given as:
γspherical (h) =

τ2+σ2ifh≥1/ϕ
τ2+σ2h
3ϕh

1−exp(−ϕ2h2)
ifh >0
0 otherwise(6)
γexponential (h) =τ2+σ2(1−exp(−ϕh)) ifh >0,
0 otherwise ,(7)
where τ2,τ2+σ2, and 1/ϕrepresent the nugget, sill, and range parameters, respectively. Here the
nugget τ2represents the semivariogram value at an infinitesimally small separation distance, i.e.,
7Figure A1: Empirical semivariograms (plotted as blue dots) with different theoretical fits (plotted as
green lines), i.e., spherical, exponential, and Gaussian.
τ2=γ(0+)≡limh→0+γ(h). The range 1/ϕis the distance at which γ(h)first reaches its ultimate
level, i.e., the sill τ2+σ2.
A.3 Empirical semivariogram
As we elaborated in Section 3.1, we plot the empirical semivariogram :
ˆγ(h) =1
2N(h)X
(si,sj)∈N(hk)[y(si)−y(sj)]2, (8)
where N(hk)is the set of pairs of points (si, sj)such that ∥si−sj∥ ∈Ik. Here Ikrepresents the
interval (hk−1, hk)such that 0< h1< h2<···< hKandk∈ {1,2, ..., K}. Figure A1 provides a
visual comparison between the empirical semivariograms computed from ground measurements and
the theoretical forms of spherical, exponential, and Gaussian semivariograms. Among these models,
the exponential semivariogram exhibits the lowest RMSE when compared to the other two models.
The RMSE between the empirical semivariogram and the theoretical model is calculated as:
RMSE =vuut1
NbinsNbinsX
i=0(ˆγi−γi)2, (9)
where Nbinsis the total number of bins used for plotting the empirical semivariogram, ˆγiis the
empirical semivariogram value for the ithbin, and γiis the theoretical value for the ithbin.
