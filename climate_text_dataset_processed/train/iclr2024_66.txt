ABSTRACT
To address the interlinked biodiversity and climate crises, we need an understand-
ing of where species occur and how these patterns are changing. However, ob-
servational data on most species remains very limited, and the amount of data
available varies greatly between taxonomic groups. We introduce the problem of
predicting species occurrence patterns given (a) satellite imagery, and (b) known
information on the occurrence of other species. To evaluate algorithms on this
task, we introduce SatButterfly, a dataset of satellite images, environmental data
and observational data for butterflies, which is designed to pair with the existing
SatBird dataset of bird observational data. To address this task, we propose a gen-
eral model, R-Tran, for predicting species occurrence patterns that enables the use
of partial observational data wherever found. We find that R-Tran outperforms
other methods in predicting species encounter rates with partial information both
within a taxon (birds) and across taxa (birds and butterflies). Our approach opens
new perspectives to leveraging insights from species with abundant data to other
species with scarce data, by modelling the ecosystems in which they co-occur.
1 I NTRODUCTION
The interconnectedness of the climate and biodiversity crises has been widely acknowl-
edged (P ¨ortner et al., 2021). Biodiversity and associated ecosystem services play a crucial role
in both mitigating and adapting to climate change, as well as being severely threatened by it. It is
essential to understand species distributions to inform land use decisions and adaptation measures.
Using machine learning and remote sensing data has proved promising for a variety of tasks in
biodiversity monitoring (Wang et al., 2010; Reddy, 2021) including species distribution modelling
(Beery et al., 2021; Estopinan et al., 2022; Joly et al., 2022), improving on traditional methods us-
ing only environmental data. Moreover, the integration of machine learning and citizen science has
proved helpful to monitor biodiversity at scale, automating labelling and decreasing the need for
costly field surveys (Lotfian et al., 2021; Antonelli et al., 2023).
Recently, the SatBird Teng et al. (2023) dataset was proposed for the task of predicting bird species
encounter rates from remote sensing imagery, leveraging observational data from the citizen science
database eBird (Kelling et al., 2013). While this framework is useful to model species’ distributions
in places where no data has been recorded before, birds represent an atypical case since relatively
large amounts of data are available. For most taxonomic groups, records are present in significantly
fewer locations. For example, the eButterfly database (Prudic et al., 2017) modelled after eBird pro-
vides high quality presence-absence data for butterfly species but has smaller geographical coverage
and less observation reports than eBird. Given this challenge, a potentially promising approach is
to leverage the relationships between the occurrence patterns of different species, which are used
extensively by ecologists e.g. in joint species distribution models. We design a task to explore this
direction, using extensive bird occurrence data to help learn from sparser butterfly occurrence data,
given the correlation in abundances between these two taxonomic groups (Gilbert & Singer, 1975;
1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024
Debinski et al., 2006; Eglington et al., 2015). Butterflies are particularly affected by climate change,
with many species being adapted to specific environmental conditions (Hill et al., 2002; R ¨odder
et al., 2021; ´Alvarez et al., 2024). We hope furthermore that such techniques will be useful in gener-
alizing ML predictions to other under-observed but hyper-diverse taxa threatened by climate change,
such as amphibians, freshwater fish, and plants.
In this paper, we consider the practical setting in which we want to do checklist completion for
species encounter rates. Our main contributions are as follows:
• We introduce SatButterfly, a dataset for predicting butterfly species encounter rates from
remote sensing and environmental data. Importantly, a subset of the data are colocated
with existing data from SatBird, making it possible for the first time to leverage cross-taxon
relationships in predicting species occurrence patterns from satellite images.
• We propose R-Tran, a model to train and predict species encounter rates from partial infor-
mation about other species. R-Tran uses a novel transformer encoder architecture to model
interactions between features of satellite imagery and labels.
• We evaluate R-Tran and other methods in predicting species encounter rates from satellite
images and partial information on the encounter rates of other species. We find that R-Tran
surpasses the baselines while providing flexibility to use with a variable set of information.
Problem definition We consider the regression task of predicting species encounter rates from
satellite imagery given partial information. Our work is in line with frameworks that leverage partial
label annotations during inference such as Feedback-prop (Wang et al., 2018), a method designed
to be used at inference time given partial labels and iteratively updates the scores of unknown la-
bels using the known labels on the test set only. C-Tran (Lanchantin et al., 2021) also proposed
a transformer-based architecture for data completion, using embeddings from image features, la-
bels and states in a multi-label classification setting. We consider our task in two different settings:
(1) within a single taxon (SatBird-USA-summer) where we split bird species into songbirds and
non-songbirds and must predict one set of species from the other, and, (2) across taxa (SatBird-
USA-summer and SatButterfly), where information for one taxon is given and the other must be
inferred. Task 2 reflects the standard imbalance in data between birds and insects, and tests the abil-
ity of ML models to leverage abundant bird data to predict butterfly data. Task 1 is designed so as
to further investigate the task, with songbirds (Passeriformes) representing a discrete taxon of birds
with approximately half the species of the whole.
We refer to SatBird-USA-summer as SatBird throughout the rest of the paper.
2 S ATBUTTERFLY DATASET
We collect and publish SatButterfly, a dataset for the task of predicting butterfly species encounter
rates from environmental data and satellite imagery. The dataset consists of remote sensing images
and environmental data along with labels derived from eButterfly (Prudic et al., 2017) observation
reports, in the continental USA. Observations in eButterfly are particularly skewed towards North
America, and we work specifically with the continental USA to match SatBird. Unlike in SatBird,
we consider observations over the full year as most butterflies are non-migratory. We follow the
process of data collection, preparation, and splitting as in SatBird, collecting satellite images, en-
vironmental data and encounter rates from recorded observations. We propose two versions of the
dataset, a) SatButterfly-v1, where hotspots do not overlap with those of SatBird and b) SatButterfly-
v2, where observations are collocated with those of SatBird (Teng et al., 2023). Each version of the
dataset contains ∼7,000 data samples.
For the targets, we use presence-absence data in the form of complete checklists from the eBut-
terfly citizen science platform. We extract checklists recorded from 2010 to2023 in the conti-
nental USA for a total of 601 species. We compute the encounter rates for each location has:
yh= (yh
s1, ..., yh
sn), where yh
sis the number of complete checklists reporting species sathdivided
by the total number of complete checklists at h. We aggregate the species observations over 13
years to construct the final targets. We follow the GeoLifeCLEF 2020 dataset (Cole et al., 2020) and
SatBird in extracting satellite data and environmental variables. Further details are in Appendix A.

3 M ETHODOLOGY : R-T RAN
Our goal is to explore methods for predicting species encounter rates given partial information. We
draw inspiration from C-Tran (Lanchantin et al., 2021), an algorithm that predicts a set of target
labels given an input set of known labels, and visual features from a convolutional neural network.
A key ingredient of the method is a label mask training objective that encodes the three possible
states of the labels (positive, negative, or unknown) during training. We propose the Regression
Transformer (R-Tran) —a model adapted to our setting, which is regression not classification. Fig-
ure 1 shows the architecture for R-Tran, which acts as a general framework for predicting species
encounter rates given (a) satellite images and environmental data, and (b) observations for a subset
of species. Key components of R-Tran are the target embeddings T, where we train an embedding
layer to represent all possible species classes, and state embeddings S, that represent state of each
species whether known or unknown through training another embedding layer. Both embeddings
are added, and concatenated with extracted features Ifrom satellite and environmental data, then
fed into a transformer encoder to model interactions between target classes and features. The model
is flexible to accommodate any available partial species information to the full set of species. If
no partial information are present, the model can still make predictions from satellite imagery and
environmental variables. During training, we provide the full set of available encounter rates and
randomly mask out a percentage of these as unknown. This percentage is chosen at random between
0.25nandn, where nis the total number of targets. During inference, we can provide information
on0or more species to predict occurrences of remaining species.
4 E XPERIMENTS
We compare R-Tran to ResNet18 (He et al., 2016) and Feedback-prop (Wang et al., 2018) models.
Feedback-prop uses a trained model (in our case, ResNet18 model) and adapts the inference for
unknown labels in a way that benefits from partial known labels. More experimental details are
available in Appendix B. We evaluate our proposed model, R-Tran, in two settings: a) within taxon:
SatBird, b) across taxa: SatBird & SatButterfly. For SatBird, we use only SatBird-USA-summer,
since butterflies are rarely active in the winter.

Within taxon (SatBird) : we split SatBird’s 670species into songbirds, denoted set A, and non-
songbirds, set B, composed of 298and372species respectively. We train one ResNet18 model on
all670species, as well as training individual ResNet18 models on A&Bspecies subsets, denoted
ResNet18- Aand ResNet18- Brespectively. R-Tran is also trained on the full set of bird species.
Table 1 shows results on SatBird: all species, subset Aand subset B. R-Tran and Feedback-prop
allow the use of available partial information about species, unlike ResNet18. We observe that
R-Tran outperforms other baselines in predicting species Agiven information about B, as well as
predicting Bgiven information about A. All results reported are the average of 3different seeds,
where the standard deviation for MSE and MAE is negligible. Also, metrics reported for set AorB
are masked for that set only.
Across taxa (SatButterfly & SatBird) : In this setting, we use the full dataset SatBird-USA-
summer, joined with SatButterfly. In SatButterfly, we select species that have at least 100occur-
rences, resulting in 172species of butterflies. When combining SatBird and SatButterfly, there are
locations where only bird species are observed, only butterfly species are observed, or both species
observed. For locations where not all classes of species are observed, we use a masked loss to mask
out absent species; we provide more details in Appendix B.
We train ResNet18 and R-Tran on SatBird and SatButterfly jointly, where we predict ( 670 + 172 =
842) species classes. We evaluate on the test set where both taxa (birds and butterflies) are observed,
where metrics reported are masked for set A, or set B. Top- krefers to the adaptive top-k metric
defined in Teng et al. (2023), where for each hotspot kis the number of species with non-zero ground
truth encounter rates in the set of predicted species. In Table 2, we report results for ResNet18,
Feedback-prop and RTran given partial observations of species to predict others. We find that R-Tran
improves the performance on species A(birds) given information about butterflies, and B(butterflies)
given information about birds. While we only evaluated the model in settings where the sets of
known and unknown labels are fixed, it should be noted that R-Tran allows for more flexibility than
Feedback-prop because at inference time, any arbitrary subset of species could be unknown, and
R-Tran does not require multiple test examples to be effective.
5 C ONCLUSION
We presented SatButterfly, a dataset that maps satellite images and environmental data to butterflies
observations. We benchmarked different models for predicting species encounter rates considering
partial information, within a taxon (SatBird), and across taxa (SatBird and SatButterfly). We find
that leveraging partial information at inference time is more effective within a taxon than across
taxa, and that our novel R-Tran model generally outperforms baselines. Our work offers avenues
for combining data from different citizen science databases for joint prediction of species encounter

In this section, we provide more details about SatButterfly dataset preparation. For the final hotspots,
we excluded locations in the sea using the 5-meter resolution US nation cartographic boundaries pro-
vided by the Census Bureau’s MAF/TIGER Cen. We collected satellite images and environmental
data for each location where butterfly species are observed. For Sentinel-2, we collected 10-meter
resolution RGB and NIR reflectance data and RGB true color images, focusing on a 5km2area
centered on each hotspot. Our criteria for image selection included a maximum cloud cover of 10%,
opting for the clearest image within specific time frames: January 1 - December 31, 2022. We as-
signed one image to each hotspot, based on the assumption that more recent satellite images better
reflect our species data, considering the higher frequency of checklists in recent years as compared
to earlier periods.
From WorldClim 1.4 (Hijmans & al., 2005), we retrieved 19bioclimatic variables as rasters with a
size of 50×50and a spatial resolution of approximately 1km, centered on each hotspot. These
variables include annual trends in temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and water
vapor pressure. In addition, we obtained 8soil-related (pedologic) variables from SoilGrids (Hengl
et al., 2017) at a finer resolution of 250meters. SoilGrids offers global maps of various soil prop-
erties, such as pH, organic carbon content, and stocks, which are generated using machine learning
techniques trained on soil profile data and environmental covariates from remote sensing sources.
As mentioned earlier, SatButterfly-v2 data is designed to share locations with SatBird, for both
birds and butterflies data to be observed. To prepare the data, we perform BallTree-based clustering
where SatBird locations are used as centriods. We then search within 1km for neighbour butterfly
observations using haversine distance. Finally, butterfly targets are aggregated and recorded for
SatBird hotspots wherever available. We end up with available butterfly targets in a small subset of
SatBird’s train/validation/test splits.
Table 3 describes the number of hotspots present in each split for the two versions of SatButterfly
dataset. Dataset is split similarily to SatBird using scikit-learn DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996)
clustering algorithm. Figures A and A shows distribution of data samples in train/val/test splits.

1
NhP
hP
s(species)−ys
hlog(ˆys
h)−(1−ys
h) log(1 −ˆys
h). For locations where not all classes
of species are observed (when combining SatBird & SatButterfly), we define a masked loss. If
we have the loss L(y,ˆy), where yis the true value and ˆyis the predicted value, and a mask M
(a binary vector or tensor of the same shape as yandˆy), the masked loss function is defined as
Lmasked (y,ˆy, M) =P
iMi·L(yi,ˆyi)P
iMi, where Miis the i-th element of the mask M. The loss is
calculated only for the unmasked elements where Mi= 1, and is averaged over the number of
unmasked elements.
All models use same input, RGB+ENV , where we concatenate environmental data (bioclimatic,
pedologic) and RGB satellite images into different channels resulting in 30channels. This is re-
ported in SatBird (Teng et al., 2023) to be the best performing compared to using RGBNIR. We

consider a region of interest of 640 m2, center-cropping the satellite patches to size 64×64around
the hotspot and normalizing the bands with our training set statistics. ResNet18 is adapted to take
30channels as inputs instead of 3channels. ResNet18 and R-Tran are trained for 50epochs using
Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) optimizers respectively.
For target embeddings Tin R-Tran, we train an embedding layer of all possible classes
{c1, c2, . . . , c m}that can exist in a target y. In our experiments, we used textual species names
from our datasets to train embeddings. Figure 4 shows embeddings of R-Tran after training the
model on SatBird. A 2D TSNE Visualization shows clear discrimination between bird families. In
state embeddings S, which are essential to mark class labels as known or unknown in a feedforward,
each class is given a state si, where sitakes a value of −1if a class label is unknown, 0if known to
be absent, or a positive value ( 0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0) if the true probability yof a class >0. This 4-bin
quantization is an adaptation to the regression problem, instead of using a single value of 1for all
present classes. This is a hyper-parameter that can be further finetuned depending on the distribution
of targets, but we found 4to be performing best in our experiments. During inference, the model
is still flexible to use information about presence 1or absence 0of species, rather than the exact
encounter rate.
FeedbackProp uses the already-trained ResNet18 model to do inference with partial labels. It com-
putes partial loss only with respect to a set of known labels Afor input sample I. Then, it back-
propagates this partially observed loss through the model, and iteratively update the input Iin order
to re-compute the predictions on the set of unknown classes B.
B.2 E VALUATION
We report metrics regression metrics, MSE and MAE. Furthermore, we report the top- 10, top- 30

the top kobserved species. In Tables 1 and 2, all metrics reported are masked for the set of classes
indicated whether it is set Aor set B, using a binary mask.
