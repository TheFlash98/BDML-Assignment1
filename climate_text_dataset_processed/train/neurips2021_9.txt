Memory to Map:
Improving Radar Flood Maps With Temporal Context and Semantic
Segmentation
Veda Sunkara1Nicholas R. Leach1Siddha Ganju2
Abstract
Global ﬂood risk has increased due to worsen-
ing extreme weather events and human migra-
tion into growing ﬂood-prone areas. Accurate,
high-resolution, and near-real time ﬂood maps
can address ﬂood risk by reducing ﬁnancial loss
and damage. We propose Memory To Map ,
a novel machine learning approach that utilizes
bi-temporal context to improve ﬂood water seg-
mentation performance for Sentinel-1 imagery.
We show that the inclusion of unﬂooded context
for the area, or “memory,” allows the model to
tap into a “prior state” of pre-ﬂood conditions,
increasing performance in geographic regions in
which single-image radar-based ﬂood mapping
methods typically underperform (e.g. deserts).
We focus on accuracy across different biomes to
ensure global performance. Our experiments and
novel data processing technique show that the con-
ﬂuence of pre-ﬂood and permanent water context
provides a 21% increase in mIoU over the base-
line overall, and over 87% increase in deserts.
1. Introduction
Climate change-driven ﬂood disasters are rapidly increasing
in frequency and magnitude (UNDRR, 2015). More people
are affected by ﬂooding than any other climate disaster (Hal-
legatte et al., 2017; CRED, 2019), hindering sustainable
development. Research consistently shows that relative
property loss caused by ﬂoods are highest in places of social
vulnerability (UNDRR, 2019; Ceola et al., 2014), exacer-
bating economic disparities (Tellman et al., 2020). Readily
available remote sensing satellite data allows for scalable,
low cost, near-real time disaster monitoring and mapping
in order to support response and relief. Multidisciplinary
approaches to ﬂood detection algorithms, leveraging con-
ventional remote sensing, hydrology, and machine learning,
are paramount to using satellite imagery for effective ﬂood
detection (Mateo-Garcia et al., 2021).
Imagery from Sentinel-1, ESA’s synthetic aperture radar
Figure 1. Memory To Map inference pipeline. The model com-
bines multi-temporal contextual information, (pre-ﬂood and GSW)
with ﬂooded radar imagery to improve segmentation performance
for Sentinel-1. We hypothesize that the subtle changes in backscat-
ter between the memory context and the ﬂood radar imagery could
potentially be exploited by the model to improve performance.
(SAR) satellite, is commonly used for ﬂood mapping as it is
free, easily accessible, cloud penetrating (i.e. the image is
not affected by the presence of clouds or other atmospheric
conditions), and systemically acquired (Potin et al., 2014).
However, the accuracy of SAR-derived ﬂood maps is often
reduced due to multiple land surfaces - such as sandy river
banks, deserts, recently cleared ﬁelds, and terrain shadows -
appearing similar to ﬂood waters in backscatter images.
Memory To Map introduces a pre-ﬂood image of the
scene and a permanent water layer (derived from the the
Joint Research Council Global Surface Water data v1.1
(hereafter “GSW”) (Pekel et al., 2016)) as input channels
to the network which provide unﬂooded context, thereby
leveraging change detection when segmenting water. Our
approach resulted in signiﬁcant improvements over the base-
line, as well as unique improvements in deserts and other
areas that are particularly difﬁcult for ﬂood mapping us-
ing SAR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
work of its type tested globally with accuracy measured
across different biomes, motivated by the frequent ﬂooding
in different biomes and the necessity of globally performant
models. The framework introduced here for training andMemory to Map: Improving Radar Flood Maps With Temporal Context and Semantic Segmentation
validating globally-applicable models is a key contribution
of this work. Our approach can also serve as a template
for using temporal information in semantic segmentation to
detect ﬂooding in SAR images.
We demonstrate a way to utilize accessible data sources
to improve semantic segmentation of ﬂoods by 21% mean
intersection over union (mIoU) overall, creating a model
for generating high quality ﬂood maps across domains. We
improved performance in uniquely challenging regions such
as deserts, in which we found a 87% increase in mIoU,
making a ﬂood mapping network useful for global applica-
tions. The use of a globally-distributed dataset for training
and validation constitutes a major beneﬁt of this model and
substantially broadens the applicability of our results. As
shown by the reliance of governments and aid agencies on
ﬂood maps derived from satellite imagery (Ho et al., 2021),
these maps enable better global preparedness for and robust
response to increasingly common climate disasters.
2. Related Work
SAR-based ﬂood segmentation approaches often rely on
the assumption that inundated areas have lower backscatter
than the rest of the scene (Chini et al., 2017; Martinis et al.,
2015). While this is often true, inundation may actually
increase backscatter compared to unﬂooded conditions in
certain situations, such as ﬂooded vegetation (Tsyganskaya
et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Approaches relying on
phase information rather than backscatter have been used
for ﬂood detection (Shen et al., 2019), but these methods are
often very sensitive to non-target change and can be difﬁcult
to implement and interpret.
There are few SAR-based ﬂood segmentation methods that
have been demonstrated to be effective globally (Mateo-
Garcia et al., 2021; Bonaﬁlia et al., 2020; Rambour et al.,
2020). Quantifying our model’s accuracy in different
biomes may help users to understand its applicability to
speciﬁc regions. Many others have discussed performance
differences of SAR-based ﬂood mapping approaches in spe-
ciﬁc geographic areas and conditions (Giustarini et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2020; Tsyganskaya et al., 2018). The use of
RESOLVE biomes (Dinerstein et al., 2017) allows us to an-
alyze chips based on their biogeoclimatic similarity without
the need for subjective grouping. Furthermore, we believe
the use of biomes as a sampling stratum for developing
globally-applicable machine learning models has value be-
yond the scope of this work, and may be worth consideration
for other computer vision tasks which must perform well
across many geographic areas.
Recent work in deep learning has leveraged recurrent neural
networks for bi-temporal change detection in using satel-
lite data (Lyu et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2019), as well as
multimodal inputs that leverage context for semantic label-ing (Audebert et al., 2018). Our work combines elements of
both of these approaches, leveraging a standard segmenta-
tion architecture with multimodal temporal information to
improve the accuracy of water maps.
3. Memory To Map
We describe the three main contributions of our work:
1.A novel data processing technique that combines
ﬂooded, pre-ﬂood, and GSW data to produce state
of the art segmentation results.
2.A U-Net training scheme to leverage change informa-
tion and context to segment ﬂoods.
3.Utilization of global biome information to assess bal-
ance of model performance across geoclimactic re-
gions, with a focus on desert biomes.
3.1. Dataset
We describe the generation of the three distinct inputs to
our network; permanent water from GSW, pre-ﬂood, and
ﬂooded chips. We use the term “chips” to indicate 512x512
pixel crops of images, in accordance with domain terminol-
ogy.
Flooded Chips: Candidate ﬂood events were selected from
the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (Brakenridge, 2010) and
ﬁltered based on the following criteria: (1) ﬂood events were
discarded unless there were Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 im-
ages within four days of each other for which at least 50% of
the Sentinel-2 image overlapped with the Sentinel-1 image.
This was required so that Sentinel-2, which carries a multi-
spectral sensor sensitive to visible and infrared wavelengths,
could be used to support the creation of high-quality hand
labels; the Sentinel-2 images were not used in this study
beyond the generation of hand labels. (2) The Sentinel-2
image was required to have less than 50% cloud cover. (3)
The dataset was balanced to remove over-representation of
common biomes (e.g. Tropical & Subtropical Grasslands,
Savannas & Shrublands) by removing ﬂood events based
on their biome (Dinerstein et al., 2017). These ﬂood events
were then divided into 512x512 chips from a total of 125
ﬂood events. For each chip, a team of domain scientists
hand-labeled segmentation masks by cross-referencing the
Sentinel-1 and corresponding Sentinel-2 chips.
Pre-Flood Chips: To generate pre-ﬂood chips, we con-
ducted a search based on the original Sentinel-1 image for
each ﬂooded chip. We searched for a pre-ﬂood Sentinel-1
image meeting three criteria: (1) the pre-ﬂood image must
be acquired from the same orbit direction as the ﬂood image
from which the ﬂooded chip was derived (i.e. the ascend-
ing or descending pass); (2) the image must be acquired
from the same relative orbit number; and (3) the pre-ﬂoodMemory to Map: Improving Radar Flood Maps With Temporal Context and Semantic Segmentation
image must be acquired 14-35 days prior to the ﬂooded
image. This date range was chosen to allow for at least
one Sentinel-1 same-orbit acquisition while exceeding the
global median ﬂood duration to increase the likelihood that
the image was acquired in an unﬂooded condition (Najibi &
Devineni, 2017). If multiple images meet all three of these
criteria, the image acquired nearest in time to the ﬂooded
image was selected as the pre-ﬂood image. If no images
meeting these criteria were found, the chip was discarded.
Out of the total 3513 available chips, pre-ﬂood images for
2250 of them were found and the others were not used.
Permanent Water Chips: For each chip, we created a
permanent water chip based on GSW data. To do so, we
cropped the Global Surface Water occurrence data to the
extent of each of our Sentinel-1 chips. The occurrence data
was then resampled to 10-meter resolution.
3.2. Training Methodology
We had 2250 total chips from 125 ﬂood events, divided into
1820 training and 430 test. We devised testing and training
splits by testing random seeds to optimize for even distribu-
tion of ﬂood water per biome and chips per ﬂood event. We
used an Adam optimizer and trained on GeForce RTX 3090
GPU. We modify the U-Net (Yakubovskiy, 2020) to accept
additional inputs by increasing the number of input chan-
nels and train with a batch size of 32, initial learning rate
of 0.001, patience of 8, random cropping data augmenta-
tions, pretrained timm efﬁcientnet b1 backbone (Wightman,
2019), and test with an identical network.
4. Results
We trained and benchmarked our network with the ﬂooded
chip, ﬂooded and GSW chips, ﬂooded and pre-ﬂood chips,
and lastly ﬂooded, GSW, and pre-ﬂood chips. As shown in
Table 1, the network performs best overall when supplied
with both the GSW and pre-ﬂood chips. We measured model
performance both with overall mIoU and overall F1 Score.

Table 1. Model performance across input channels. The model that
includes ﬂooded, GSW, and pre-ﬂood chips perform consistently
better than models with fewer inputs. Results tallied for all biomes.
To assess geographic variation in model performance, we
assigned each chip a biome based on the RESOLVE biome
corresponding to the majority of its area. Of the biomes in-
cluded, those with the lowest average Sentinel-1 backscatter
are Deserts & Xeric Shrublands (henceforth Deserts) andTropical & Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas & Shrublands.
As shown in Figure 2, just including a pre-ﬂood chip did
not improve model performance in these biomes; however
including GSW data substantially improved model perfor-
mance in Deserts. The model which included the ﬂooded,
pre-ﬂood, and GSW chips was the best-performing model
in the majority of the evaluated biomes. For a selection of
predictions for each biome, see Appendix Figure 4.
Figure 2. Comparison of four models across different RESOLVE
biomes. The biomes are arranged from least to most represented
in the data2. The model trained on ﬂooded, GSW, and pre-ﬂood
chips performed better on Deserts than the model trained on just
ﬂooded chips by 87% mIoU.
We sought to improve model performance in uniquely chal-
lenging biomes for SAR such as Deserts. To assess this,
we trained all four of our networks on only Deserts, all
biomes except Deserts, and all biomes, and in all cases
tested only on Deserts. As shown in Figure 3, networks
trained on only Deserts had the best performance, while
networks with ﬂooded and GSW and pre-ﬂood, GSW, and
ﬂooded chips performed comparably well when trained on
all biomes. The network provided with pre-ﬂood, GSW, and
ﬂooded chips trained on all biomes except Deserts had the
best performance compared with models with fewer inputs.

Deserts, and every biome, and tested on Deserts.Memory to Map: Improving Radar Flood Maps With Temporal Context and Semantic Segmentation
5. Analysis
Given the challenges with segmenting water from Sentinel-1
SAR imagery, we developed a segmentation network and
algorithm that leveraged context to generate better ﬂood seg-
mentation masks at the high-resolution scale needed to sup-
port disaster resilience. We performed a novel cross-biome
global analysis, and found that our method signiﬁcantly im-
proved network performance in uniquely challenging low
backscatter regions such as deserts.
While we found that simply providing the model with per-
manent water data signiﬁcantly improved performance over
segmentation with a single ﬂooded chip, providing perma-
nent water and a pre-ﬂood chip provided the best results.
This is possibly because the model is able to leverage the
combination of the permanent water mask and the visual rep-
resentation of the permanent water state (i.e. the pre-ﬂood
chip) to then better interpret unique water/land boundaries.
Notably, we found that providing the network with the pre-
ﬂood chip and ﬂooded chip only slightly improved perfor-
mance over simply providing the ﬂooded chip. This is likely
due to the network requiring more context for the distinction
between the two input chips.
5.1. Biome Analysis
As expected, the models which only included a ﬂooded chip
performed poorly in biomes with low average backscatter
(Figure 2). For Desert chips, models which included GSW
data performed better, and the model which included both
GSW and a pre-ﬂood chip was the best performing. The
inclusion of the GSW data is likely helping the model distin-
guish between deserts and open water, which have similar
backscatter intensities. These results suggest that informa-
tion about permanent water is important for SAR-based
water segmentation in areas with low average backscatter.
Models provided with ﬂooded, pre-ﬂood, and GSW data,
when trained on all biomes except Deserts, perform best
on Deserts compared to models with fewer inputs (Figure
3). The models with both forms of context are best able
to generalize to unseen biomes. This suggests that, when
developing a network with a limited amount of training
data representing a key challenge area, providing pre-ﬂood
and GSW context together can boost performance. The
ability to generalize is necessary for deployment, especially
when training data from the main application or speciﬁc
2The biome labels refer to Tropical & Subtropical Dry
Broadleaf Forests (59 chips); any other biomes (110 chips); Deserts
& Xeric Shrublands (128 chips); Temperate Grasslands, Savannas
& Shrublands (192 chips); Temperate Broadleaf & Mixed Forests
(389 chips); Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (633
chips); and Tropical & Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas & Shrub-
lands (731 chips).geographic regions may be missing.
The approach described in this paper has some important
limitations. Generating context data for each chip involves
extra data preparation and processing. Selecting appropriate
pre-ﬂood images requires some assumptions about the dura-
tion of ﬂoods that may not always be true; for example, a
“pre-ﬂood” image acquired 14 days before the ﬂooded image
may still contain ﬂooding. Optimal selection of pre-ﬂood
images may also vary among geographic areas and ﬂood
types. Additionally, this model is only usable if there is a
valid pre-ﬂood image available; simply using GSW yields
signiﬁcant performance boosts and is universally accessible.
As the results of this study show, the inclusion of context did
not always improve the model’s performance; in Tropical &
Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas & Shrublands, the model
which included both GSW and pre-ﬂood chips performed
worse than the model with only ﬂooded chips. Changes
in the backscattering properties of these grasslands due to
rainfall create spatially-varying changes in the backscat-
ter between the pre-ﬂood and ﬂooded images, potentially
explaining this dip in performance.
6. Discussion and Conclusion
Memory To Map is a prototype for utilizing contextual
information to improve the performance of semantic seg-
mentation of ﬂood water in Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery. Im-
proving the accuracy and reliability of these ﬂood maps
allows for near-real time ﬂood monitoring even in adverse
weather conditions, a common precedent to extreme ﬂood
events. These near-real time maps can then be used for disas-
ter relief and response, as well as for planning for necessary
infrastructure for climate resilience. Our novel biome-based
analysis demonstrates the applicability of this methodology
to global domains. Providing context to segmentation net-
works results in a signiﬁcant performance boost in areas
with relatively low backscatter, such as deserts, making the
algorithm globally performant.
Future work should include a more rigorous exploration
of context inputs. To emphasize change detection based
on seasons, a pre-ﬂood image could be constructed as a
pixelwise statistical measure (such as average or z-score)
of backscatter values taken at even intervals across the pre-
vious year. Additional contextual information can also be
constructed based on publicly available datasets, such as
pixelwise masks containing biome, land cover, agricultural,
and population density information. Topographic informa-
tion could also provide the network with context for water
drainage and movement patterns over time. As the successes
of this approach vary across biomes, using an ensemble ap-
proach to decide which model is best for detecting ﬂood
water in a scene may provide the best results globally.Memory to Map: Improving Radar Flood Maps With Temporal Context and Semantic Segmentation
Reliable and high-resolution ﬂood detection methods al-
low for the development of effective disaster relief sys-
tems. These system can provide critical services to give
governments and aid organizations the resources to rebuild,
replant crops, access international aid, and more. The de-
scribed novel data processing technique produces segmenta-
tion models that are performant regardless of biogeography
and generalize effectively, creating consistent ﬂood maps
that can be deployed to mitigate harm to climate vulnerable
communities, regardless of their location.
