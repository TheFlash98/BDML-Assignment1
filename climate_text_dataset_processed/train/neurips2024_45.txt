Abstract
In response to climate change, assessing crop productivity under extreme weather
conditions is essential to enhance food security. Crop simulation models, which
align with physical processes, offer explainability but often perform poorly. Con-
versely, machine learning (ML) models for crop modeling are powerful and scalable
yet operate as black boxes and lack adherence to crop growth’s physical princi-
ples. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths
of both approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water
scarcity at the pixel level. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in
physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to
water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function. Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite im-
agery, climate data, simulated water use data, and pixel-level yield data, our model
demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an R2of up to 0.77—matching or surpass-
ing state-of-the-art models like RNNs and Transformers. Additionally, it provides
interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers,
and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions.

used to calculate the actual yield loss ( Yl). We leverage prior knowledge describing the relationship
between water use and the relative yield loss. (b) Performance plots for visual inspection of a single

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.In response to climate change, closing the gap between potential and actual yields is an urgent task
to sustain food security [ 7]. Extreme weather conditions like droughts and floodings are pressing
challenges in the agricultural sector, directly affecting productivity, and causing yield losses [ 2,15].
Digital agriculture has emerged as a key strategy to address these challenges, providing tools for timely,
informed decision-making by policymakers, industry stakeholders, and farmers [ 19]. The response of
crop yields to water availability has been a central focus of research for decades, serving as a critical
parameter in assessing crop resilience under extreme climate conditions [ 17]. Traditionally, simulation
models, also known as process-based models, have been employed to capture this relationship. These
models build upon biological and physical principles to offer high explainability, supporting decisions
in areas such as irrigation, fertilization, pest management, and disease control. However, crop
simulation models often struggle with high-resolution, multidimensional data, are computationally
intensive, and require calibration, rendering their applicability to high spatial resolution (pixel-level)
unfeasible. Furthermore, they are often simplified representations of reality, relying on approximations
to maintain computational efficiency [ 12], oftentimes resulting in inaccurate performances [ 13].
Therefore, machine learning (ML) models are increasingly utilized for crop productivity estimation
[21]. Recent studies demonstrate impressive scalability and accuracy, even at pixel resolution
[9,16], by handling complex and multidimensional data [ 14]. However, ML models are often
criticized for their black-box characteristics, limiting their interpretability [ 4]. Additionally, ML
are seldomly designed to follow underlying physical principles of plant growth [ 8], thereby hardly
ever providing meaningful intermediate outputs, which are essential for tracking crop responses to
changing environmental conditions over time. There is a growing demand to integrate the strengths of
data-driven ML approaches with the interpretability of simulation models [ 5,12]. While some recent
studies attempt to combine ML and prior knowledge for yield prediction, also under water-limited
conditions [ 20], these approaches generally focus on data enrichment rather than on producing
interpretable and physical consistent sequential outputs of crop physiology, similar to simulation
models. Consequently, they often retain the black-box limitations of conventional ML models,
providing limited insight into crop physiology by potentially violating governing physical principles.
This study seeks to bridge the gap between interpretable simulation models and high-performance
ML models by introducing a physics-informed approach to crop yield loss forecasting. We argue that
we can learn more precisely the water use and the crop susceptibility to water scarcity, by building
upon Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral imagery, climate data, and simulations, coupled with pixel-level
yield data from cereal crops harvested between 2017–2021 in Switzerland. We demonstrate yield loss
estimation at the pixel level, grounded on physical principles by sequentially solving the equation
for crop yield response to water scarcity [ 6], using an enhanced loss function. Initial results indicate
high potential, achieving an R2of up to 0.77, matching or surpassing the performance of state-of-
the-art (SOTA) ML models for yield prediction, including RNNs and Transformers, while providing
interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in
adapting to extreme weather conditions.
2 Methodology
Problem Definition The water use, also called evapotranspiration (ET), is the sum of all biophysical
processes in which liquid water is converted to water vapor from various surfaces, including topsoil
and vegetation. For a specific crop type, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) differentiates
between the maximum ( ETx) and the actual ET ( ETa). The former represents the water use under
standard and non-limiting environmental conditions and is solely impacted by climate conditions
and crop specifics, achieving full productivity, i.e., disease-free, well-fertilized, and under optimum
soil water conditions. In contrast, the ETarepresents the water use under limiting environmental
conditions, resulting in a reduction in water use and ultimately causing a reduction of crop productivity.
This reduction in productivity is defined as yield loss and typically expressed in relative terms. Various
factors cause productivity limiting conditions, including soil infertility, soil salinity, limited soil water
content, diseases, and poor management. Especially, in the light of extreme weather conditions, the
frequency of severe droughts and floodings is expected to increase, causing either water scarcity or
water abundance, negatively impacting ET and crop productivity [ 12,2]. Assessing the reduction in
ET, is a major challenge in agriculture. A detailed description of biophysical processes of the ET is
described by the FAO-56 method [ 1], using the Penman–Monteith equation, recommended for daily
ET (mm/day) estimation. The ET under limiting condition is defined by:
ETa=Ks·ETx, (1)
2withKsbeing a stress coefficient, resulting in a reduction of the ET. In an earlier work, the FAO
described the relationship between water use and the relative yield loss [ 6], stating that the relative
reduction in ET is related to the relative reduction in yield:
Yl=
1−Ya
Yx
=Ky
1−ETa
ETx
, (2)
withYaas the actual yield, Yxthe maximum yield, or potential yield, and Kyas the crop yield
response factor. This factor represents the effect of a reduction in ET on the crop yield by capturing
the complex relationship between crop water use and productivity. More specifically, Ky>1
indicates high sensitivity to water deficits with a proportionally larger yield reduction, and Ky<1
indicates higher resilience to water deficits. Different studies exist, that empirically estimated Ky
coefficients for various crops. However, often reporting differences, making the equation difficult to
solve analytically. Furthermore, Kyvalues change over the growing period, since many crops exhibit
variable susceptibility to water scarcity over the growing period. More importantly, while ETxcan
be more or less accurately estimated, by following [ 1], estimating the ETais is very difficult with
high precision, making Eq. 2 difficult to solve accurately in reality.
Architecture & Evaluation To address this limitation, we propose to learn both ETaandKyusing
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We constrain the network by physical information such that the
reduction in ET corresponds to the observed reduction in yield. We argue that simulated ETxvalues
are sufficiently accurate. This is supported by previous studies [ 3], allowing us to focus at ETaand
Kyat pixel resolution. We leverage an RNN, more specifically a LSTM [ 11] backbone architecture,
where each hidden state is passed to a sequential layer with 128 hidden units, incorporating a linear
layer, batch normalization, and dropout. Finally, two linear layers are incorporated with a single
output channel each, reflecting KyandETa, respectively. Physical constraints are imposed by
integrating information based on the ET and the relative reduction in crop yield, resulting in a
physics-informed RNN (PI-RNN). To estimate the yield reduction at time step tias a function of a
reduction in ET, a two component loss term is employed:
Ltotal=λ1Ll+λ2Lphys, (3)

With 1{·}as the indicator function, which equals 1 if the condition inside the braces is true and 0
otherwise. The first component pushes the network to predict KyandETathat, by using Eq. 2 the
predicted yield loss ( ˆya) is close to the actual yield loss ( ya) of the ground truth data. The second
component forces the network to produce ETavalues bounded between [0, ETx] and sufficiently
close to ETx, to solve Eq. 2 with biophysical consistency. Moreover, λis a hyperparameter that
controls the weighting of both terms. Figure 1 (a) depicts the overall architecture of the PI-RNN.
Data & Evaluation As ground truth data, combine harvester yield data is used. More specifically,
54098 yield samples from 54 yield maps of cereal crops are used. This data was harvested in
Switzerland between 2017 and 2021, containing georeferenced data points with information about
the yield in 10mpixel resolution. An example yield map is depicted in Figure 1 (b). For detailed
information about the dataset and preprocessing, we refer the reader to [ 18]. We define the maximum
yield sample as the yield potential ( Yx). The reduction for each sample is expressed in relative terms
as(1−ya
Yx). For the simulations, we employ the FAO paper-56 [1] that simulates ETxover time.
For training, S2 L2A multispectral time series data is Femployed using 10 spectral bands, available
from seeding to harvesting with 10mresolution as the model input. Additionally, weather data is
incorporated, including the total precipitation and temperature, derived from [ 10]. Data modalities
are early fused using the raw time series of S2 images, by aggregating weather features between S2
time steps.
For each experiment, a K-fold cross-validation (K=10) is performed, where results correspond to the
average across folds. For quantitative evaluation, standard regression metrics are used. This includes
the coefficient of determination ( R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE).
To evaluate the potential of the proposed method, we compare results against current SOTA models
3for crop yield prediction, including RNN (LSTM) [ 16] and Transformers [ 9]. Note that these models
cannot predict physical consistent outputs, only the final relative yield loss.
3 Results
In Table 1, we evaluate the yield loss prediction performance by comparing the predicted crop yield
loss to the actual yield loss and compare the results against a RNN and Transformer model. All
models are trained on S2 and weather data. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the RNN
model on various regression metrics, such as R2and RMSE. In detail, we demonstrate a 2 percentage
point (p.p.) improvement. Compared to the Transformer model, our method achieves similar results
on all metrics. Only a minor decrease of 1 p.p, in R2is observed. Additionally, we showcase the
performance of the simulation model, and highlight its weak performance to predict the actual yield
loss effectively. This is because the water use cannot be predicted at the pixel level, as it depends on
weather data with a 30kmspatial resolution. Additionally, the simulation models struggle to estimate
actual water consumption with high accuracy (see Figure 2 (a)). Qualitatively, Figure 1 (b) depicts
an example yield map, showcasing accurate predictions at pixel level with high spatial variability,
close to the target data. To further assess whether the inclusion of S2 data enhances the accuracy of
crop yield loss estimation at the pixel level, we trained several models with different data modalities.
Results are depicted in Table 2, underlying the improved performance, when S2 data is used. In detail,
a significant improvement of 21 p.p. in R2is shown over the model trained solely on weather data.
Figure 2 (a) illustrates the sequential estimations of ETaandKyvalues up to 120 days before
harvest, alongside simulated ETxandETavalues. The Figure indicates that Kyvalues remain
below 1, suggesting a higher resilience to water scarcity in this dataset. Furthermore, it is depicted
that estimated ETais consistently lower than the simulated ETx, indicating yield loss due to water
limitation. In Figure 2(b), the relationship between ET and predicted yield loss is shown. The
Figure demonstrates that yield loss decreases during the growing period in correlation with increased

4 Conclusion
Informed Neural Networks hold significant potential for crop yield modeling, offering enhanced
adaptability to challenging environmental conditions. We presented a novel approach to modeling
crop productivity under environmental constraints by incorporating biophysical properties and demon-
strated promising experimental outcomes. To further assess the validity of the proposed method,
additional experiments on larger and more diverse datasets are necessary, encompassing a wide range
of yield limiting conditions.
