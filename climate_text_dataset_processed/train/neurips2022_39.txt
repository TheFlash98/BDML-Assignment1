However, land in the Central Valley is sinking at a rapid rate (as 2 much as 20 cm per year) due to continued groundwater pumping. Land subsidence 3 has a significant impact on infrastructure resilience and groundwater 4 sustainability. In this study, we aim to identify specific regions with different 5 temporal dynamics of land displacement and find relationships with underlying 6 geological composition. Then, we aim to remotely estimate geologic composition 7 using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based land deformation 8 temporal changes using machine learning techniques. We identified regions with 9 different temporal characteristics of land displacement in that some areas (e.g., 10 Helm) with coarser grain geologic compositions exhibited potentially reversible 11 land deformation (elastic land compaction). We found a significant correlation 12 between InSAR-based land deformation and geologic composition using random 13 forest and deep neural network regression models. We also achieved significant 14 accuracy with 1/4 sparse sampling to reduce any spatial correlations among data, 15 suggesting that the model has the potential to be generalized to other regions for 16 indirect estimation of geologic composition. Our results indicate that geologic 17 composition can be estimated using InSAR-based land deformation data. In-situ 18 measurements of geologic composition can be expensive and time consuming and 19 may be impractical in some areas. The generalizability of the model sheds light 20 on high spatial resolution geologic composition estimation utilizing existing 21 measurements. 22 1 Introduction 23 The Central Valley aquifer system is home to 6 million residents, 250 different crops, and a $17 24 billion per annum agricultural industry. Groundwater from the Central Valley is a valuable resource 25 that complements surface water, especially during times of drought or limited surface water 26 availability. It is a heterogeneous aquifer system with confined, semi-confined, and unconfined 27 aquifers where fresh groundwater occurs in alluvial deposits down to 3000ft [1]–[3]. 28 Due to extensive agricultural activity and land use, the groundwater system in Central Valley has 29 steadily suffered groundwater loss, estimated to be around 125 million acre-feet of groundwater 30 drained between 1920-2013. This groundwater extraction has led parts of the aquifer to land 31 subsidence, as rearranging of groundwater-suspended sediment grains compacts aquifer layers. 32 Inelastic subsidence causes severe damage within the aquifer system, such as infrastructural damage 33 and loss of groundwater storage space. 34    2 As the groundwater is pumped, the pore space between fine-grained silts and clay decreases, 35 lowering the land surface. Compacted land cannot store as much groundwater as it used to. Some 36 land compactions are reversible, and some are not, depending on the geologic composition. The 37 types of subsidence may also change over time. Once reversible subsidence regions would 38 experience continued compaction and become irreversible regions [4]–[7]. It is important to identify 39 the type of subsidence, because we can take appropriate actions to each type of subsidence [8]. We 40 will be able to recharge groundwater for reversible or elastic regions, and strictly control 41 groundwater usage for irreversible or inelastic regions.  42 In-situ geologic composition quantification is important in managing groundwater and 43 preventing/recovering land subsidence, yet costly and labor intensive. Moreover, understanding 44 geologic composition is essential for hydrological models for future predictive models of land 45 subsidence and groundwater levels, especially in regions where extensive geologic data are not 46 available. In this study, we aim to indirectly quantify geologic composition based on temporally 47 changing remote land deformation information using InSAR. 48 2 Methods 49 2.0 InSAR data processing 50 We processed Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellite data of track 42 and 144 from 2015/03/01 to 2020/08/31 and 51 2014/11/08-2019/01/22, respectively to estimate ground movement associated with groundwater 52 withdrawal/recharging in the Central Valley, California. The two tracks cover most of the central 53 and southern Central Valley including San Joaquin Valley and Tulare Basin. The S-1 satellite 54 constellation has been acquiring interferometric wide-swath mode data over the Central Valley with 55 a regular interval of 12 days and a revisit time as short as 6 days using terrain observation by 56 progressive scan (TOPS) technique. We use the JPL/Caltech ISCE software to generate the S-1 57 interferometry and limit our interferometric pairs to the ones with temporal baseline no more than 58 24 days. This mitigates temporal decorrelation. We then use a sentinel-1 stack processor to co-59 register all SAR single look complex (SLC) images to the reference geometry and employ the 60 enhanced spectral diversity technique to estimate azimuth misregistration between SLC images in a 61 stack sense. Each interferogram is corrected for topographic phase and then unwrapped and 62 geocoded using SRTM DEM model. After generating hundreds of unwrapped interferograms for 63 each track, we use a variant of the Small Baseline Subset InSAR time series inversion approach to 64 solve for line-of-sight (LOS) displacement time series and mean velocity. The approach also 65 estimates the DEM error and uses spatiotemporal filtering to suppress high-frequency troposphere 66 noise. For more details about the InSAR processing and time series analysis, please refer to Liu et 67 al. (2019) [9]. The cumulative LOS displacements at each image date are outputted to a GMT grid, 68 which is resampled to a ground posting of ~2km x 2km. 69 2.1 Geologic composition 70 The data for geologic composition was obtained from the geotexture model published as part of the 71 USGS Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM). The geotexture model was created based on 72 lithologic data from 8,500 borehole logs, with depth reaching down to 3000ft from land surface. 73 The lithologic data was classified in binary bins of fine-grained or coarse-grained. This was based 74 on the original description in the log, with coarse-grained sediments encompassing sand, gravel, 75 pebbles, and boulders and fine-grained sediments encompassing clay, lime, loam, mud, or silt. Then 76 the percentage of fine-grained and coarse-grained sediments were calculated in 50ft segments. The 77 texture model arrays are organized in the same dimensions as the groundwater flow model, with 1-78 mi by 1-mi grid cells and 10 modeling layers based on horizontal geologic characteristics. Roughly 79 20,000 model cells are active within the Central Valley. Readers are pointed to Faunt (2009) [10] 80 for more details on the geotexture model.  81 Coarse grain percent of each model layer from 1 to 10 in northern and southern Central Valley 82 regions was used as the prediction target (Supplementary Figure 1). Coarse-grained soil is defined 83 as containing no more than 50% fine grains (i.e., silt and clay, or particles smaller than 0.075 mm). 84 2.2 Data interpolation 85    3 We first integrated multimodal data including InSAR, groundwater, precipitation, and geologic 86 composition by interpolating data with the same spatial and temporal resolutions (every 2 weeks on 87 a 2kmX2km grid) (Supplementary Figures 2 & 3). We then identified regions with different temporal 88 dynamics of land displacement, groundwater depth, precipitation, and geologic composition 89 (Supplementary Figure 4). Some areas (e.g., Helm) with coarser grain geologic compositions 90 exhibited potentially reversible land transformations (elastic land compaction).  91 2.3 Geologic estimation models 92 We used long short-term memory (LSTM) as a recurrent network component. Conventional 93 recurrent neural networks still have significant practical problems caused by exponential decay of 94 gradient descent, which hinders learning of long-term relationships between time points. LSTM is 95 a special type of recurrent neural network that can learn long-term dependencies through selective 96 memory consolidation [11]. We used 3 convolutional input layers, 6 recurrent layers, 1 fully 97 connected layer, and 1 softmax layer [12], [13]. Model training aims to minimize the error function 98 E, the mean squared error (MSE) that quantifies the difference between the estimated (neural 99 network outputs) and the true 10-layer geologic compositions (ground truth in-situ data). Input data 100 include InSAR subsidence data, covering 8818 different locations, and 132 biweekly time points (5 101 years). Here, the coarse grain percent of 10 layers was estimated.  102  103

(C) Correlation between 106 model output and ground truth at different layers of geologic composition. (D) Scatter plot 107 between the ground truth and estimated geologic composition of the entire layer (R=0.88).   108 3 Results 109 We found that the InSAR remote sensing data had predictive power for geologic composition using 110 deep neural networks (correlation coefficient R=0.88) (Figure 1). A decision tree (R=0.65) and 111 random forest model (R=0.85) was tested as baseline. We also achieved significant accuracy with 112 only 40% of the training data (R=0.80), suggesting that the model can be generalized to other regions 113 for indirect estimation of geologic composition. We performed an estimation with distant data 114 sampling (minimum distance between samples was 10km) to reduce the impact of spatial correlation 115 of adjacent data points, and we found a slightly degraded performance (R=0.83) (Supplementary 116 
   4 Figure 5).  117 4 Discussion  118 In this study, we showed that geological composition can be estimated remotely using InSAR land 119 deformation data. In-situ measurements of geological composition are critical to understanding 120 hydrology and monitoring groundwater availability. However, in-situ measurements are expensive 121 and time consuming. If geologic composition can be measured remotely using this model, high 122 spatial resolution geologic composition can be quickly quantified only with InSAR satellites without 123 in-situ measurements. The next step is to apply this model to other regions, including US High Plains 124 and North China Plains, to evaluate its generalizability [14]. 125 As a further analysis to determine which time of year contributed the most to the estimation of 126 geologic composition, we performed a leave-one-month-out 10-fold cross-validation performance 127 test (Figure 2). When we excluded the October and December data from the estimation model, we 128 found a significant decline in correlation, indicating that this month contributed the most to 129 estimating the geological composition. Most of the precipitation occurs in late autumn and winter, 130 and precipitation has influenced time-series changes in InSAR land deformation, indirectly 131 indicating the inner geological composition of the Central Valley. 132  133 
 134 Figure 2. Leave-one-month-out 10-fold cross-validation performance test. Correlation degradation 135 was computed as each month was excluded from the input parameters of the model. October 136 (p=0.00175) and December (p=0.000654) showed significant degradation compared to total data 137 correlation. The statistical significance cut-off is at p=0.004 considering Bonferroni multiple 138 comparisons (0.05/12 comparisons=0.004). 139  140 One caveat of this study is the lack of ground truth geologic composition data for independent model 141 validation. In-situ geologic composition data from other regions (e.g., US High Plains, North China 142 Plains) will be required for further testing. At the same time, the lack of geologic composition data 143 points to the advantage of a significant potential applicability of this model. Our suggested model 144 can be applicable to future missions such as NISAR and NASA’s Decadal Survey Designated 145 Observables like Mass Change (MC) and Surface Deformation and Change (SDC) as an indirect 146 geologic composition product [15].  147 Acknowledgments 148 The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 149 under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 150 References 151 [1] C.
