ABSTRACT
The Open Forest Observatory (OFO) is a collaboration across universities and
other partners to make low-cost forest mapping accessible to ecologists, land man-
agers, and the general public. The OFO is building both a database of geospatial
forest data as well as open-source methods and tools for forest mapping by un-
crewed aerial vehicle. Such data are useful for a variety of climate applications
including prioritizing reforestation efforts, informing wildfire hazard reduction,
and monitoring carbon sequestration. In the current iteration of the OFO’s for-
est map database, 3D tree maps are created using classical structure-from-motion
techniques. This approach is prone to artifacts, lacks detail, and has particular
difficulty on the forest floor where the input data (overhead imagery) has lim-
ited visibility. These reconstruction errors can potentially propagate to the down-
stream scientific tasks (e.g. a wildfire simulation.) Advances in 3D reconstruction,
including methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), produce higher quality
results that are more robust to sparse views and support data-driven priors. We
explore ways to incorporate NeRFs into the OFO dataset, outline future work to
support even more state-of-the-art 3D vision models, and describe the importance
of high-quality 3D reconstructions for forestry applications.

drone-captured forest imagery.The Open Forest Observatory (OFO) is an open
source software and data repository created in
a joint effort by UC Davis, University of Ari-
zona, and CU Boulder to facilitate drone-based
forest mapping for forest ecology and manage-
ment applications. The dataset in development
includes drone-derived 2D photos and videos
of forests, photogrammetry-derived 2D and 3D
forest maps (Young et al., 2022), and field-
based tree geolocation and species classifica-
tion information, among other forest data.
Currently, the 3D forest models in the OFO
are created using structure-from-motion (SfM)
(Schonberger & Frahm, 2016), a classical pho-
togrammetry technique. SfM uses keypoints in images to reconstruct a point-cloud and depth maps
that can then be processed into a 3D mesh. It is not designed to synthesize photo-realistic novel
views in the absence of complete data and the meshing approaches often obscure fine detail that can
be useful in semantic classification.

Several recent advances in 3D reconstruction have been made to ameliorate these problems, how-
ever little study has been made on applications to forest data, especially for scientific applications,
which have different thresholds for acceptable error. The OFO has partnered with computer vision
researchers to explore translating state-of-the-art computer vision models to this vital application
area. This effort is on-going and in this paper we report on its progress and introduce the OFO
dataset to the AI community to encourage further collaboration.
Specifically we explore Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) (Mildenhall et al., 2021) as applied to
forest mapping. We use NeRF to improve the reconstruction quality in the OFO. NeRFs have been
shown to have much higher reconstruction quality and are able to fill in novel views (Yu et al., 2021).
In our experiments, we show that NeRF is not only better at creating a more photorealisitic 3D scene,
it also produces a higher quality mesh. Photorealism has benefits beyond aesthetics. Understanding
density and biomass in a forest are essential to tasks such as estimation of fuel for wildfires and car-
bon sequestration. While estimating these quantities requires some 3D understanding of the world,
it does not necessarily require an exact 3D geometry. There are many qualitative measurements that
are currently only done by sending an expert to physically walk through a forest to estimate things
like fuel density or tree spacing. A sufficiently high quality visual experience could facilitate virtual
remote qualitative assessments by experts. Such renderings could even enable neural networks to
eventually augment or conceivably replace these human assessments. Further validation and bench-
marking could allow for quantitative assessments as well, for example counting trees and estimating
volumes.
Contributions: In this paper, we introduce the Open Forest Observatory, demonstrate qualitative
visual improvement (e.g. clearer tree structure, trunks, and leaves) with NeRF on forest data leading
to greater opportunity for virtual qualitative assessment, and outline the various extensions of this
technology that can further transform the way forests are managed.
2 B ACKGROUND
Forest Mapping: Forest inventories are critical resources for understanding ecological processes
and informing forest management, but they have traditionally required time-consuming ground-
based surveys. Individual tree-level measurements including location, height, stem diameter, health
status, and species identity require substantial time and effort to obtain. Advances in drone and
imagery processing technology are enabling a new era of forest research in which individual trees
can be mapped, measured, and identified to genus or species across broad areas without extensive
ground surveys (Mlambo et al., 2017; Camarretta et al., 2020), reducing survey time to days rather
than months. Drone-based mapping approaches generally involve executing a drone mission to
collect a series of images with high (70-90%) image-to-image overlap over a contiguous study area.
The images are then traditionally processed using photogrammetry into downstream data products
such as an orthomosaic, canopy height model, and a 3D mesh model of the scene. In turn, one or
more of these products can be used extract forest inventory data; for example, individual treetops
may be detected as local maxima in the canopy height model (Young et al., 2022) and trees may be
classified to species based on their appearance in the orthomosaic (Ferreira et al., 2020; Weinstein
et al., 2023).
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF): NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2021) is a neural network based tech-
nique for 3D reconstruction. It reconstructs accurate 3D scenes by modeling the volumetric scene
geometry and appearance from a set of images, and is designed to synthesize novel views of com-
plex scenes. A NeRF is an implicit function that takes in a set of 3D points (x, y, z) and viewing
directions ( θ, ϕ) from a scene which are then fed through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to produce
a pixel value with a predicted set of colors (r, g, b) and density σ. To create a novel view of the scene,
NeRF employs ray casting on each pixel in the view, creating a set of colors and densities along ray
at random points. Classical volume rendering techniques are then used to accumulate those colors
and densities into a 2D image using the following color accumulation equation: ˆc(o, d) =NP
i=1wici,
where the integration is weighted by wi=Tiαi, the accumulated transmittance (the fraction of light
that reaches the camera) times the opacity of the i-th ray segment. To supervise the neural network,
the predicted value is then compared with the true color cof the input image via the following loss
function: LRGB =||ˆc−c||1.

3 N EURAL RECONSTRUCTION PROOF OF CONCEPT
The OFO is a program created by forest ecologists for other ecologists, land managers, and the
general public. The OFO aims to integrate existing and emerging imagery processing tools and
techniques, tune them for forestry applications, and present them through user-friendly interfaces.
The OFO’s initial focus on classical photogrammetry-based approaches has achieved high-quality
mapping of the forest overstory (Young et al., 2022), but the limited utility of these methods for
understory reconstruction poses some constraints to widespread adoption by the forest ecology
and management community. In particular, most forest inventory methods, management prescrip-
tions, and ecological analyses rely critically on measurements of tree stem diameter at breast height
(DBH), which can be challenging to obtain using photogrammetry even in sparse stands (Swayze
et al., 2021; Swayze & Tinkham, 2022).
Figure 2: NeRF (top) versus current SfM mesh re-
construction (below) on overhead drone imagery.
The NeRF retains more fine detail in the trees,
most notably leaf and branch structure.The project described in this paper represents
a recent effort to bring in computer vision re-
searchers to the OFO to explore translating
state-of-the-art models for 3D reconstruction to
real forestry applications. This work is on-
going, but we share our progress in an effort
to encourage others in the AI community to en-
gage with this dataset and contribute to this vi-
tal application area.
For this proof-of-concept work, we used an
OFO video acquisition, collected using a DJI
Phantom 4 Pro v2 drone, that included footage
from many angles of an isolated lodgepole pine
(Pinus contorta ) on the Tahoe National Forest
near Graegle, California (39.67 deg W, 120.62
deg N). We processed the data in nerfstudio (Tancik et al., 2023) and used their nerf-facto method
to create a NeRF of the scene (Fig. 1). It is immediately obvious the significantly enhanced photo-
realism of the NeRF compared to a SfM created mesh (Fig. 3a). Detail such as branches, leaves, and
trunks can be made out much more clearly which can aid in a variety of downstream tasks including
species classification and trunk measurement. In Fig. 2, we show another example of a NeRF, this
time created from overhead imagery. As the images were taken from further overhead, less detail is
visible, but it is still more photorealistic than the current 3D model in the OFO taken on a similar
stand of trees with the same image collecting procedure.

SfM.
(b) Mesh extracted from NeRF.
Figure 3: A side by side of a 3D point-
cloud and a 3D mesh generated via different
reconstruction methods of the same imagery.The mesh extracted from the NeRF also has improved de-
tail. A SfM point-cloud generated from the same data has
a significant number of floaters. In Fig. 3 we compare
the two. The high number of artifacts prevents us from
reasonably meshing the point-cloud. Those floaters can
be removed through post-processing, but in general we
are not seeing much detail in the individual trees, which
is consistent with the SfM data already present in OFO.
In addition to providing a richer visual experience, hav-
ing more detail can serve a various scientific purposes.
There are several qualitative tasks that typically require
an expert walking through a forest, such as fuel load es-
timation or density verification, that could potentially be
done virtually with a NeRF, saving significant travel time
and costs as many forests are quite remote. NeRFs also
allow the 3D qualitative experience to be saved, enabling
more robust comparisons across time.

4 T HEPOTENTIAL OF NERF IN THE OFO:
CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Broad-extent forest inventory data is critical for informing management of forests in our era of
changing climate, increasing drought stress, and unnaturally high-severity wildfires. Due to a cen-
tury of intensive fire suppression and exclusion of indigenous forest stewardship through fire, dry
forests in the western U.S. – and many other areas around the globe – have become unnaturally
dense (Safford et al., 2017). With more trees competing for the same finite pool of resources, par-
ticularly water, such “overstocked” stands are at high risk of mortality due to drought (Young et al.,
2017). Forest mortality, whether through drought, fire, or other environmental stressors, has clear
implications for carbon storage and myriad other ecosystem services. Understanding tree density is
essential for proper forest management.
Forest management such as mechanical thinning, prescribed fire, and reintroduction of beneficial
wildfire can greatly ameliorate the stresses associated with unnaturally dense forest stands and im-
prove forest resistance to drought and fire (Young et al., 2020), thus reducing the risk of catastrophic
forest and carbon loss. However, resources for such forest management are stretched thin, and only
a small fraction of forest area needing management each year receives treatment (North et al., 2021;
2015). Thus, data to inform efforts to prioritize forest management across space and time is critical.
Because in-person assessments and surveys for all forests are not practical, modern tools to auto-
mate and virtualize forest measurement could thus provide substantial value to forest management
efforts. The OFO aims to greatly increase the efficiency of such data collection using drone-based
alternatives to traditional ground-based surveys and enable individuals such as forest managers to
both collect and process the data into extensive forest inventory maps suitable for informing man-
agement decisions. The work presented here, and future expansions upon it, will help to improve the
fidelity of drone-derived products to the real-world stand conditions, thus increasing their relevance
for informing management to maintain healthy forests.
Figure 4: A SfM reconstruction where
trees are floating off the ground.The vanilla NeRF proof-of-concept is just a gateway to
exploring NeRF-based method for forestry. There are
several variants of NeRF that could also improve the qual-
ity and types of data the OFO offers. The next immediate
goal is to greatly scale up the size of the NeRF taking
inspiration from other large-scale NeRF efforts (Tancik
et al., 2022). We also wish to do a better job filling in the
hard-to-image understory: Trees often appear to be float-
ing floating (Fig. 4). We plan to explore approaches that
combine diffusion models with NeRF (Deng et al., 2023;
Gu et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). We believe forests
are particularly well suited to this approach as we have a
strong prior that most everything we are imaging is a tree, and there are basic principles such as
“trees should be connected to the ground” that we can enforce to improve reconstruction quality.
Another exciting extension of NeRF that could aid in forestry management is the incorporation of
language models. LERF (Kerr et al., 2023) allows for natural-language searching through a NeRF,
which if fine-tuned on species level forest data could be very useful for finding and counting species.
As we see more multi-model models that can handle question answering, we could imagine merging
those with NeRF as well to give more information about the 3D environment such as stand density,
basal area, or biomass, all of which are important metrics in estimating carbon sequestration and
fuel sources for wildfires.
The OFO is compiling extensive imagery and ground truth data (in the form of geospatial locations,
species labels, and diameter measurements) of forest stands across the western U.S. and ultimately
around the world. We plan to curate a subset of the data in the form of well-defined “challenge
problems” to spur the development of new vision methods specifically designed for this high-impact
application area. Already metrics for 3D reconstruction quality are a hotly debated topic in the
community, as what constitutes an acceptable versus an unacceptable error is often dependent on the
downstream application. In many forestry applications the key metric is faithful reconstruction of a
tree’s stem diameter at breast height (DBH), given it is the size metric around which the vast majority
of forest ecology models and management prescriptions are based. With a specific downstream

application in mind, along with extensive and high-quality ground-truth DBH data, we hope to
provide a new application area and validation metric to the 3D reconstruction community.
With this paper we invite the AI community to explore the OFO dataset for themselves and consider
contributing methods to this vital application area. The introduction of NeRF has potential to not
only improve the visual appearance of the 3D maps, but to allow for the introduction of a host of
other AI-powered approaches that can greatly increase the types of secondary data produced. This
data has huge potential to help in wildfire preparedness and estimating carbon sequestration, two
objectives that become increasingly important as our climate changes.
