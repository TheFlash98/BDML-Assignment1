Abstract
Tree species classification plays an important role in nature conservation, forest
inventories, forest management, and the protection of endangered species. Over
the past four decades, remote sensing technologies have been extensively utilized
for tree species classification, with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) emerging as a
key technique. In this study, we employed TomoSense, a 3D tomographic dataset,
which utilizes a stack of single-look complex (SLC) images, a byproduct of SAR,
captured at different incidence angles to generate a three-dimensional representation
of the terrain. Our research focuses on evaluating multiple tabular machine-learning
models using the height information derived from the tomographic image intensities
to classify eight distinct tree species. The SLC data and tomographic imagery were
analyzed across different polarimetric configurations and geosplit configurations.
We investigated the impact of these variations on classification accuracy, comparing
the performance of various tabular machine-learning models and optimizing them
using Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we incorporated a proxy for actual
tree height using point cloud data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to
provide height statistics associated with the model’s predictions. This comparison
offers insights into the reliability of tomographic data in predicting tree species
classification based on height.
1 Introduction and Methodology
Tree classification is critical for preserving forests, protecting endangered species, and assessing
carbon sequestration, among other ecological benefits Fassnacht et al. [2016]. This study lever-
ages 3D tomographic images derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, generated by
TomoSense—an experiment funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) Tebaldini et al. [2023].
These images have undergone comprehensive preprocessing, including co-registration, geometric
correction, image alignment, and noise reduction. In anticipation of the ESA’s Biomass Satellite
launch next year, which will operate in full tomographic mode for an entire year, this work explores
the potential of tomographic images for accurate tree species classification. We utilized a manually
classified dataset comprising eight distinct tree species within our area of interest, as outlined in Table
3, to serve as our ground truth.
To achieve optimal classification results, we applied a range of tabular machine learning models,
utilizing tabular data and enhancing performance through Bayesian optimization combined with
Preprint. Under review.AutoML techniques. This approach enabled us to efficiently explore the model space and optimize
performance metrics simultaneously. This work establishes a framework for future large-scale forest
inventories, potentially enhancing forest management, biodiversity assessments, and carbon stock
estimations.
1.1 Scope and Related Work
Tree species classification in forests typically involves a combination of morphological, physiological,
and genetic methods to accurately identify and categorize different species Zhang et al. [2023].
Morphological methods rely on visible characteristics such as leaf shape, bark texture, tree height,
and branching patterns. These features are often complemented by phenological observations,
including flowering and fruiting times. Physiological methods can include analyzing the biochemical
properties of tree tissues, such as leaf pigments or resin composition. Additionally, genetic methods,
such as DNA barcoding and molecular markers, provide precise identification by analyzing the
genetic material of the trees. In practice, these methods are often used in conjunction to improve
accuracy, with field observations typically serving as the first step, followed by laboratory analysis
when necessary. Advanced technologies, like remote sensing and machine learning, as employed
in this work, are increasingly being integrated into species classification to enhance efficiency and
precision, as well as enable global analysis Pu [2021].
The main stakeholders involved in tree species classification in forests, as in Pelyukh et al. [2021]
include forestry professionals, conservationists, government agencies, researchers, and local commu-
nities. Forestry professionals and government agencies rely on accurate classification for sustainable
forest management, policy-making, and regulatory compliance. Conservationists use species data
to prioritize areas for protection and restoration, aiming to preserve biodiversity. Researchers are
involved in advancing scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, contributing to climate change
models and ecological studies. Local communities, especially indigenous groups, ar stakeholders as
they often possess traditional knowledge of species and rely on forests for their livelihoods, making
their involvement essential for culturally and ecologically sensitive management practices.
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is increasingly being used to address the challenges of tree
species classification in forests due to its ability to provide high-resolution, all-weather, and day-
and-night imaging capabilities. Traditional methods of species classification, while effective, are
often limited by accessibility, weather conditions, and the sheer scale of forested areas. SAR data
overcomes these limitations by penetrating cloud cover and capturing detailed surface information,
including tree structure and biomass, which are critical for distinguishing between species Ren et al.
[2024]. This remote sensing technology allows for more comprehensive and frequent monitoring
of forests, making it a valuable tool for stakeholders who require accurate and timely data for
conservation, forest management, and ecological research. By integrating SAR data with other
classification methods, the accuracy and efficiency of species identification are significantly enhanced,
providing a robust solution to the challenges posed by traditional techniques.
In the context of utilizing SAR data for tree species classification in forests, AutoGluon Erickson
et al. [2020] plays a role by automating the machine learning process, making it easier to develop and
deploy highly accurate predictive models. AutoGluon is an open-source library that simplifies the
process of applying machine learning by automatically selecting the best models and hyperparameters
based on the input data, including complex SAR datasets. When applied to SAR data for tree
species classification, AutoGluon can efficiently handle large and diverse datasets, selecting the best
models that can extract relevant features such as texture, structure, and backscatter characteristics
from the radar imagery. Among the models that AutoGluon might select and optimize are gradient
boosting machines (e.g., XGBoost), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and random forests,
which are known for their strong performance in handling high-dimensional data and capturing
complex patterns. These models, once optimized by AutoGluon, can significantly improve the
accuracy of species classification by effectively leveraging the unique properties of SAR data, thereby
enhancing decision-making in forestry management and conservation efforts.
2 Experimental Design
In this section, we explain the dataset’s characteristics, the features used for creating the classification
model, and the geographical split of the data.
2Figure 1: From left to right: the first image shows the single-look complex (SLC) image of the study
area; the second depicts the intensity of the Tomographic SAR image; the third presents the cloud
points from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data; and the final image displays the tree
species map for the study area.
2.1 Dataset
The TomoSense dataset provides several valuable resources, including single-look complex (SLC)
images and point-cloud data captured from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), among other
useful information. For our experiments, we focused on the radar signal intensity derived from the
constructed tomographic image. This tomographic data has a spatial resolution of 2 meters, with
dimensions of 326 pixels in the range direction, 840 pixels in the azimuth direction, and 36 pixels in
the height direction. Additionally, it includes three different polarimetric configurations (HH, HV ,
VV) and two opposite heading directions (North-West and South-East).
The species classification data collected by the field survey was provided by Landesbetrieb Wald
und Holz Nordrhein-Westfalen, Nationalparkforstamt Eifel, Germany. The biotope types group layer
can be selected in the Web Map Service Landscape Information Collection (WMS LINFOS), which
shows the spatial location of biotope types worthy of protection in North Rhine-Westphalia. Work
was done to convert this data from an HTML format to a vector-based one that could be integrated
with the TomoCube data. This dataset includes 8 species of tree (e.g Aspen, Pine). The dataset
statistics are given in Appendix A.1. The dataset is imbalanced, with the majority class (Aspen)
accounting for 60% of the study area.
2.2 Machine Learning Features
The tomographic SAR image used in our study has a 2-meter resolution along the elevation axis and a
1-meter resolution along both the azimuth and range axes. The data captures heights ranging from -10
meters to 50 meters. To structure our analysis, we employed a voxelized tomographic representation
with a 1-meter by 1-meter resolution in the azimuth-range plane and a 2-meter resolution along the
elevation axis.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the data processing pipeline involves several key steps. Initially, the
original data is divided using one of two distinct spatial splits. Following this, the dataset is
further separated by polarimetry, and we also evaluated combinations of the different polarimetric
configurations. Additionally, we assessed whether incorporating spatial coordinates could enhance
model performance. This process results in a feature array that includes the intensity values from
the tomographic image, each associated with its respective polarimetric channel. Given that each
heading captures only a portion of the total spatial area, as depicted in Fig. 1, it is crucial to combine
the data from both headings for a comprehensive analysis.
2.3 Geographical Split
Spatial autocorrelation is a significant challenge in remote sensing, often leading to violations of
the independence and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption during data splitting. Completely
eliminating this issue remains a considerable challenge Salazar et al. [2022]. In this study, we
addressed this problem by implementing two distinct data splitting strategies, as depicted in Fig. 2.
These strategies include a swath split and randomly generated square regions. The swath split covers
3Figure 2: Geographic data splits used for training and testing: The left figure illustrates the swath
split, while the right figure depicts the square split.

P Swathe With XY 0.72 0.36
P Square No XY 0.56 0.20
P Swathe No XY 0.60 0.25
20% of the data’s width, while the squares are set to 5% of the width. For both swath and square
splits, the data was divided into an 80:20 ratio for training and testing. The test data is held out until
the final model is selected using AutoGluon, after which it is evaluated.
2.4 Model Training
In our study, we utilized AutoGluon (Erickson et al. [2020]), an AutoML tool, to streamline the
process of evaluating and selecting the best machine-learning models for tree species classification.
AutoGluon simplifies the machine-learning pipeline by automatically tuning hyperparameters, select-
ing features, and optimizing models. Among the various models tested using AutoGluon, ensemble
methods such as gradient boosting machines and deep neural networks stood out in terms of accuracy
and performance. These models achieved high accuracy and robust performance, making them ideal
for handling the complexities of TomoSAR data.
3 Results and Discussion
The comparisons of different geographic splitting for model species classification accuracy are given
in Table 1. The increase in accuracy when the inputs include the range and azimuth per pixel (x,y)
indicates that spatial information significantly enhances tree species identification. This improvement
suggests that tree species distribution patterns have a strong spatial component, likely reflecting the
clustering of similar species, perhaps due to topographic variations or competitive interactions.

In Table 2, we presented a table with the classification report, including the precision, recall, F1-score,
and support for each tree class, as well as the overall accuracy, macro average, and weighted average.
In Figure 3, we display at the top the true tree classification and bottom the predicted classification.
4Figure 3: Result for Classification and Prediction
The classification results show that some discrimination of species is possible with TomoSar data,
and also the challenges in dealing with a highly imbalanced dataset. While the model achieves a
reasonable overall accuracy of 72%, this metric is heavily influenced by its strong performance on
the dominant class (Class 1 Aspen, 64.3% of samples, F1-score: 0.84). The substantial gap between
the macro-average F1-score (0.39) and the weighted-average F1-score (0.70) underscores the model’s
struggle with minority classes, particularly Classes 2, 3, 6, and 7 (F1-scores < 0.30). This disparity
suggests potential overfitting to the majority class and insufficient learning from underrepresented
classes. The generally higher precision compared to recall for minority classes indicates a conservative
prediction approach, possibly due to the class imbalance. Future research directions should focus
on improving minority class prediction and investigating data augmentation or transfer learning to
enhance the model’s performance on underrepresented classes without compromising its accuracy on
the majority class.
4 Conclusions
In this work, we investigate the potential of 3D SAR images for tree species classification. Utilizing
the TomoSense dataset, we transform the 3D image data into a tabular format, where each pixel
corresponds to a specific height within the canopy. Our experiments focus on the P-band and examine
how different polarimetries influence the model’s accuracy and F1-score. We observed that certain
classes, such as Aspen Forest, are readily distinguishable due to their prevalence in the dataset.
However, classes like Oak Forest and Beech Forest proved more challenging for the model to classify
accurately. Additionally, we used cloud points derived from LiDAR images as a proxy for the ground
truth height. Using this ground truth, it could be seen that the model tends to overestimate the
height of certain types of trees. Our findings underscore the inherent difficulties in classification,
particularly for forest types like Oak-Beech Forests, where moisture and dense vegetation complicate
the disentanglement of ground and vegetation signals. This work opens the floor for new works using
the P-band and the tomographic reconstruction for tree species classification.
