Abstract
Forests are in decline worldwide and it is critical to attribute forest cover loss
to its causes. We gathered a curated global dataset of all forest loss drivers and
developed a neural network model to recognize the main drivers of deforestation or
forest degradation at 1-km scale. Using remote sensing satellite data together with
ancillary biophysical and socioeconomic data the model estimates the dominant
drivers of forest loss from 2001 to 2022. Using a relatively light-weight geospatial
model allowed us to to train a single world-wide model. We generated a global
map of drivers of forest loss that is being validated, and present the ﬁrst insights
such data can provide.

1 Introduction
Forests are in decline worldwide due to human activities such as agricultural expansion, urbanization,
and mineral extraction [ 1,2]. Forest disturbance due to generally temporary causes, such as wildﬁre
and forestry, is important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion (deforestation) for the
purposes of carbon accounting and supply chain management. However, existing global maps of the
drivers of forest loss, notably a 10 km dataset from 2018 [ 3], are not spatially or thematically detailed
enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales, such as governments or companies, to be able
to act on the information provided.
Better deforestation attribution supports tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-
deforestation commitments [ 4,5], Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land) [ 6,7], global

standing of the cause of forest loss and degradation enables decision makers to design and implement
targeted forest conservation strategies and policy interventions [ 10]. A better characterization of the
direct drivers of forest loss can alert relevant industry and government bodies to the risks of carbon
emissions and biodiversity loss within their supply chains and jurisdictions.
Using satellite observations and ancillary biophysical and socioeconomic data, we develop a 1
km-resolution global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss between 2001 and 2022 for seven
categories: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining),
shifting cultivation, forest management (e.g. wood ﬁber plantations), wildﬁre, settlements and
infrastructure, and other natural disturbances (e.g. hurricane damage).
Main contributions In this work we explored different satellite data sources and model approaches
(transformer-based, convolutional, and random forest) and and set up a framework for efﬁcient dataset
generation, model training, evaluation, and inference map generation. We present the ﬁrst global map
of forest loss drivers at 1km scale, characterizing drivers of forest loss into 7 global categories, using
a single world-wide model — all novel advancements, to the best of our knowledge.3
Related work The attribution of direct drivers of forest loss is an active area of research and of
great interest to governments, civil society, and the private sector. Recent studies have quantiﬁed
drivers across the tropics [ 11,12,13,14,15,16], Africa [ 17], and Europe [ 18]. The focus has also
been on speciﬁc commodities or regional dynamics such as shifting cultivation [ 19], smallholder
agriculture [ 20], cocoa [ 21], oil palm [ 22,23], soybeans [ 24], and rubber [ 25]. Some of the most
novel advancements have been in near-real-time classiﬁcation of drivers, enabling monitoring and
interventions by governments and forest defenders [ 26,27]. Despite these recent advancements, the
most widely used model for the drivers of forest loss is still a seminal global study by [ 3] at a coarse
spatial resolution of 10 km and using only 5 categories.
2 Methods
Figure 2: Scheme of overall ﬂow of data and model training.The overall scheme of data ﬂow and
model training and global inference
maps generation is outlined in Fig-
ure 2.
Label collection Training data
were collected by a team of expert an-
alysts using the drivers of forest loss
deﬁnitions in Table 4 (Appendix A)
[28]. The process involved region
and category stratiﬁed sampling with a human-in-the-loop active learning phase, as described in
Appendix B. The ﬁnal category distribution of training samples in each region is shown in Table 5.
Training dataset generation We use Google Earth Engine [ 29] to construct training and evaluation
datasets, as well as for generating global inference maps. Satellite time series data is aggregated
annually for the selected years. For simplicity, all data is re-sampled at a common scale (15 meters
proved to be a good trade-off between accuracy and computational costs). Additionally, we found that
providing a larger context window (x1.5) was useful for the training accuracy and global inference
map construction. Further details on the predictor variables can be found in the Appendix Table 6.
Data sources for the presented experiments are shown in Table 7.
Baseline models Since data inputs are relatively unique for the given task, we adapted a set
of transformer-based and convolutional models from computer vision. For vision transformer
approaches, we used ViT [ 30] at various scales and a variant of ViViT [ 31]. For the ViT model, all
input data sources were rescaled to a common resolution and stacked in the channels dimension. The
ViViT variant allowed us to keep all data sources separate at the original resolutions, and perform the
data fusion at various locations in the model (early/mid/late). For the convolutional neural network
3We intend to release publicly the collected training data, code, and the generated global maps upon proper
veriﬁcation and approval.
2baseline, we used a variant of the Residual Network (ResNet) model [ 32,33], with re-sampling and
stacking all data sources in the channels dimension.
Initial experiments showed better performance for the convolutional model, and we tuned its architec-
ture to better ﬁt our speciﬁc 1km-resolution remote sensing data. We found a shallow customized
version to perform the best by adjusting the ﬁrst stem layers of the model and reducing the depth
while increasing the width of the layers, resulting in a 12.8M parameter model.
3 Experimental Results
Experimental setup Given the relatively small amount of data for a neural network model, we
used 5-fold cross-validation for training and assessing the accuracy of the model. An additional step
to synthetically increase the amount of training data included random data augmentation, such as
random rotations and ﬂips. The model is trained for 50 epochs and using the Adam optimizer with
weight decay. The tuned training parameters for the best model conﬁguration are reported in Table 9.
Data pre-processing includes normalization of all non-binary layers to have zero mean and standard
deviation of one. For simple 2D models (such as the custom ResNet), all input layers were stacked
together in the channels dimension.
For each model, we use 20 random seeds to initialize the model weights and for training data
randomization (shufﬂing and data augmentations), resulting in total in 100 trained models (5 folds
x 20 random seeds) for which we report the mean and standard deviation of the common metrics
(overall accuracy and F1 macro-averaged score, as well per-class precision, recall, and F1 scores).

and macro-averaged F1 score.

RF 63.6 (0.7) 52.4 (1.4)Overall model performance Results for transformer-based
(ViT), convolutional (ResNet), and random forest (RF) models
are shown in Table 1. The customized ResNet model demon-
strated the best cross-validation accuracy and is used for the
follow-up experiments and inference. To note is that the variance
in evaluation metrics is partially due to variance in the evaluation
folds (20% of training data). When keeping the evaluation folds
ﬁxed, the mean standard deviation only due to model training
randomness is 0.4%–0.5%.
We also explored unsupervised pre-training of the transformer models and using raw satellite data
instead of the derived contextual layers, but neither exploration improved our results. It is important
to note that we do not and cannot expect the provided contextual layers to be error-free – rather we
expect the models to learn the general patterns and be tolerant to missing or incorrect information.
Regional and per-category performance Separate metrics for the best model conﬁguration per
region and per category type are presented in Table 2. One can observe signiﬁcant differences in
performance based on the region: while in Europe and North America the performance is better, it’s
worse in Southeast Asia and Asia. This is probably related to fewer, more uniform, and easier to
recognize drivers over Europe and North America (forestry, wildﬁres). In contrast, the diversity of

classes over the tropics is more diverse and more complex to recognize. The increased variance is
due to smaller sample sizes of the evaluation data subsets4.
Wildﬁres are usually easiest to recognize, while other natural disturbances are the most difﬁcult. On
the one hand much larger forest loss is happening due to wildﬁres, and on the other hand the other
natural disturbances can be more subtle and encompass a wider range of disturbance types (e.g. bark
beetle outbreaks or storm damage), making them more challenging to recognize.
Global inference map insights The generated inference map is visualized in Figure 1 and in the
Appendix Figure 7 (to be publicly released). Global forest change (GFC) data [ 34] is used to identify
areas with forest cover loss, for which the major driver of forest cover loss is estimated. A ﬁrst
preliminary aggregation of major forest loss drivers at 1km scale is presented in Table 3. Different
forest loss drivers dominate in different regions. While forest loss and deforestation in the tropical
regions is mainly driven by permanent agriculture, in other regions of the world either wildﬁres or
forest management are dominant. When attributing the recognized drivers to the main forest cover
loss event year, we can demonstrate the development of forest area losses over time, per main driver
and per year, as shown in Figure 3 exemplary for the regions of Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
Figure 3: Forest cover loss area over time for Asia, Latin America, and Africa (per year).
4 Conclusion
We presented data, models, evaluations, and generated global maps for deforestation attribution
recognition at 1km scale. The light-weight model is tuned to work with a diverse set of inputs from
raw satellite and auxiliary contextual layers, and is used to classify all major drivers of forest loss
globally. Initial results are demonstrated globally, per region, and per driver category.
The presented map is the ﬁrst-ever global map of deforestation attribution at sub-10 km scale, that
provides ﬁner thematic detail than available up to now. It also demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that
a single model can be used globally for the given task (all previous works either trained separate
regional maps or focused on sub-global areas).
The current approach has the limitation that it predicts only a single major driver of forest loss across
the given time range. Also, this work relies on already detected forest cover loss, as provided by the
GFC. A potential research direction is to develop a general forests understanding model. Also, future
4The results reported in this paper are based only on training data cross-validation, not accounting for
sampling bias and tree cover loss bias. We also collected a separate validation dataset and when accounting for
the biases, obtained a preliminary overall accuracy of 90.5% [28].
4work directions include developing approaches at 10 to 30 meter resolution, providing further detail
into drivers characteristics, and higher temporal resolution. This will be supported by research in
pre-training, representation and embeddings reuse, and multi-source data processing and modeling
advances.
This work will help tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-deforestation com-
mitments, global biodiversity targets, and the quantiﬁcation of carbon emissions.

A Deﬁnitions
This study divides the world into seven regions: North America (NoAm), Latin America (LatAm),
Europe (Eur), Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia (SE-Asia), and Australia-Oceania, as outlined in Figure 4.
We split Asia into two sub-regions, Southeast Asia and the rest (East/South/Central Asia & Middle
East), due to signiﬁcantly different deforestation dynamics and the high importance of that region for
forest and biodiversity preservation.
Similar to the Global Forest Watch (GFW) Global Forest Change (GFC) data products developed
by the University of Maryland (UMD), we use a geographic coordinate system (WGS84) to create
a 0.01 degree by 0.01 degree global grid (approximately 1km x 1km at the equator) for training
data sampling and generating inference maps. Predictor variable data sources have 0.5 arc-seconds
resolution (approximately 15m at the equator) per pixel.
We map seven drivers of forest loss: permanent agriculture, hard commodities, shifting cultivation,
forest management, wildﬁre, settlements and infrastructure, and other natural disturbances. The
deﬁnitions of the categories are presented in Table 4, with examples shown in Figure 5.
B Training labels data collection
Training data were collected by a team of expert analysts using the drivers of forest loss deﬁnitions in
Table 4 (Appendix A) [ 28]. The unit of interpretation was a plot that was approximately 1x1 km at the
equator and contained tree cover loss according to [ 34], updated through 2022. To avoid interpreting
noise, we subset the 1x1 km plots to those where tree cover loss makes up at least 0.05% of the
plot. For each plot, analysts collected information on the primary driver of loss (>50% of the loss
within the plot), secondary driver of loss, and their conﬁdence in assigning each label. Conﬁdence
was assigned as low,medium , orhigh. We collected additional levels of detail that were not used
in the analysis: 1) for hard commodity plots we differentiated between mining orenergy , 2) for
permanent agriculture plots we differentiated between tree crop management oragriculture . Tree
crop management was deﬁned as loss associated with pruning, replanting, or other management
8Table 4: Drivers of forest loss and their deﬁnitions.
Driver Deﬁnition
Permanent agricul-
tureLong-term, permanent tree cover loss for small- to large-scale agricul-
ture.This includes perennial tree crops such as oil palm, cacao, orchards,
nut trees, and rubber, as well as pasture and seasonal crops and cropping
systems, which may include a fallow period.
Hard commodities Tree cover loss due to the establishment or expansion of mining or en-
ergy infrastructure. Mining activities range from small-scale and artisanal
mining to large-scale mining. Energy infrastructure includes power lines,
power plants, oil drilling and reﬁneries, wind and solar farms, ﬂooding
due to the construction of hydroelectric dams, and other types of energy
infrastructure.
Shifting cultivation Tree cover loss due to small- to medium-scale clearing for temporary
cultivation that is later abandoned and followed by subsequent regrowth of
secondary forest or vegetation.
Forest management Forest management and logging activities occurring within managed, nat-
ural or semi-natural forests and plantations, often with evidence of forest
regrowth in subsequent years. This includes harvesting in wood-ﬁber plan-
tations, clear-cut and selective logging, establishment of logging roads, and
other forest management activities such as forest thinning and salvage or
sanitation logging.
Wildﬁre Tree cover loss due to ﬁre with no visible human conversion or agricultural
activity afterward. Fires may be started from natural causes (e.g. lightning)
or may be related to human activities (accidental or deliberate).
Settlements and
infrastructureTree cover loss due to expansion and intensiﬁcation of roads, settlements,
urban areas, or built infrastructure (not associated with other classes).
Other natural dis-
turbancesTree cover loss due to other non-ﬁre natural disturbances, including storms,
ﬂooding, landslides, drought, wind-throw, lava ﬂows, sediment ﬂow or
meandering rivers, natural ﬂooding, insect outbreaks, etc. If tree cover
loss due to natural causes is followed by salvage or sanitation logging, it is
classiﬁed as forest management.

activities within orchards or tree crop plantations that were already established as of the year 2000
(or before the year of loss).
Next, after starting model training, we collected additional training data via an active learning
workﬂow to improve the initial drivers of forest loss classiﬁcation. The initial set of training plots was
limited, geographically incomplete, and did not always represent all forest loss dynamics globally. In
order to improve the representation of drivers we took an additional sample of 2,433 plots that were
identiﬁed in three ways: 1) visual inspection of the maps to identify large-scale misclassiﬁcation, 2)
plots where the ﬁrst and second most likely class had a probability margin of 1% or less, and 3) plots
for which the classiﬁcation of the two models we were initially testing disagreed (a random forest
model and a residual convolutional neural network model (ResNet)).
The training dataset and active learning dataset combined resulted in 6,955 plots, 22% of which had a
secondary driver in addition to a primary driver. From all the training plots interpreted (7,786), 831

(11%) were removed due to low conﬁdence (7%) and noise (4%). The majority of the remaining
plots, which were used in model development, had high conﬁdence (80%). The ﬁnal training samples
distribution of categories per region is given in Table 5 and the locations are shown in Figure 6.
In addition to the training data, a separate stratiﬁed random sample of 3,574 1x1 km plots is used
to estimate the accuracy of the ﬁnal classiﬁcation map [ 28]. Validation plots were identiﬁed and
collected independently of training data following the best practices outlined in [ 35] and [ 36]. The
validation results will be published [ 28], and we intend to release the training data in a public
repository under the CC-BY 4.0 license.
C Training data and predictor variable data sources
Some of the evaluated predictor variables data sources are described in Table 6.
In dependence of dataset selection, for each sample patch we extract global forest change (GFC)
data (includes two Landsat 7 cloud-free composites before and after potential forest loss events) [ 34],
10Sentinel-2 data (ﬁltered for cloud coverage using Cloud Score+ [ 37]), and derived contextual layers:
Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) [ 38], TanDEM-X-based GLO 30 Forest And Building
removed Digital Elevation Model (FABDEM) [ 39], tree cover loss due to ﬁres [ 40], mining composite
dataset [ 41,42,43], and land cover embeddings derived from Dynamic World [ 44]. For simplicity
of processing, all data sources are re-projected to the same resolution and coordinate system at 15
meters per pixel. Most datasets cover the time range from 2001 to 2022, and are expected to be
updated in future.

Data source Description
Global Forest
Change (GFC)GFC data contains global layers of forests cover, gain and loss, with the year
of tree cover loss along with ﬁrst and last Landsat 7 cloud-free composite
[34]. The reference composite imagery are median observations from a
set of quality assessed growing season observations in four spectral bands:
red, near infrared (NIR), and two short-wavelength infrared bands (SWIR1
and SWIR2).
Sentinel-2 The model included multiple years of Sentinel 2 data. Sentinel data were
processed using the Cloud Score+, ﬁltering out cloudy areas with a default
clear threshold below 60% [ 37]. We used the following Sentinel 2 bands,
[B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B8A, B11, B12], which have nominally 10
or 20m resolutions per pixel.
Landsat 7/8/9 Multi-spectral sensors at 30 to 60m resolution (not used explicitly, since
high-quality layers are already provided in GFC).
Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-band) dual-pol (VV , VH) data at 10m resolu-
tion. Evaluated, but didn’t include in the ﬁnal data source mix due to no
visible improvements.
ALOS-1/2
PALSAR-1/2Synthetic Aperture Radar (L-band) dual-pol (HH, HV) data at 25m resolu-
tion. Evaluated, but didn’t include in the ﬁnal data sources mix due to no
visible improvements.
Dynamic World v1 Land cover map generated for each Sentinel-2 scene [ 44]. Since the 9
pseudo-probability layers are provided for the 9 classes, we used them
directly as a low-rank embedding of the surface at 10m resolution.
Tree cover loss due
to ﬁre layerGlobal layer of tree cover loss due to ﬁre, generated by UMD/GLAD and
regularly updated [40].
FABDEM Elevation data were obtained from the Copernicus GLO 30 resolution
Digital Elevation Model with forest and building removed (FABDEM).
The data are available at 1 arc second (approximately 30m at the equator)
for the globe [39]. We use the elevation, slope, and aspect.
Global Human
Settlement Layer
(GHSL)Global population data were obtained from the GHSL, which depicts
the spatial distribution of residential populations derived from CIESIN
GPWv4.11 and disaggregated from census and administrative units to grid
cells at a resolution of 100 m [ 38]. We subset GHSL from 1995 to 2025
and we resampled the resolution to 30m by dividing 30m by the 100m
pixels.
Location Geographic location can be included in two ways, either encoding latitude
and longitude directly (usually after projection into 3 dimensions) and/or
encoding the 7 regions (e.g. as a one hot encoding, a binary numerical
value (0/1) that corresponded to each region).
Mining composite
datasetWe combined three datasets mapping the location of mining sites [ 41,42]
and alluvial mining [ 43] worldwide. These datasets were created through
manual delineation using satellite imagery.
