ABSTRACT
Accurate precipitation forecasting is a vital challenge of societal importance.
Though data-driven approaches have emerged as a widely used solution, solely
relying on data-driven approaches has limitations in modeling the underlying
physics, making accurate predictions difficult. We focus on the Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) post-processing based precipitation forecasting task
to couple Machine Learning techniques with traditional NWP. This task remains
challenging due to the imbalanced precipitation data and complex relationships
between multiple meteorological variables. To address these limitations, we intro-
duce the PostRainBench , a comprehensive multi-variable NWP post-processing
benchmark, and CAMT , a simple yet effective Channel Attention Enhanced
Multi-task Learning framework with a specially designed weighted loss func-
tion. Extensive experimental results on the proposed benchmark show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.3%, 4.7%, and 26.8% in rain
CSI and improvements of 15.6%, 17.4%, and 31.8% over NWP predictions in
heavy rain CSI on respective datasets. Most notably, our model is the first deep
learning-based method to outperform NWP approaches in heavy rain conditions.
These results highlight the potential impact of our model in reducing the severe
consequences of extreme rainfall events. Our datasets and code are available at
https://github.com/yyyujintang/PostRainBench.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Precipitation forecasting (Sønderby et al., 2020; Espeholt et al., 2022) refers to the problem of pro-
viding a forecast of the rainfall intensity based on radar echo maps, rain gauge, and other observation
data as well as the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models (Shi et al., 2017). Accurate rainfall
forecasts can guide people to make optimal decisions in production and life. Though the occurrence
of extreme precipitation events is relatively infrequent, they can lead to adverse impacts on both
agricultural production and community well-being (de Witt et al., 2021).
In the past few years, geoscience has begun to use deep learning to better exploit spatial and temporal
structures in the data. Comparing to directly extrapolating rainfall field with convolutional–recurrent
approaches (Shi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017), which is mainly based on data-
driven extrapolation and lacks physics-based modeling (Kim et al., 2022), post-processing NWP
rainfall prediction provides more physically-consistent results. Combining AI-based and NWP
methods can bring about both strengths for a stronger performance (Bi et al., 2023). For the post-
processing task, NWP predictions are fed to a deep learning model which is trained to output refined
precipitation forecasts, while rainfall station observations are used as ground truth. In a nutshell, the
overall task is to post-process the predictions from NWP with deep models, under the supervision
of rainfall observations.
However, Post-NWP optimization poses several distinct challenges that distinguish it from typical
weather forecasting optimization problems and computer vision tasks. (1) The absence of a unified

arises from the spatial dependencies and diverse statistical properties of atmospheric variables; (3)
The existing significant data imbalance, i.e., light rain and heavy rain, makes the task harder to
implement.
To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce PostRainBench , a comprehensive multi-
variable benchmark, which covers the full spectrum of scenarios with and without temporal infor-
mation and various combinations of NWP input variables and we propose a new model learning
framework CAMT , a simple yet effective Channel Attention Enhanced Multi-task Learning frame-
work with a specially designed weighted loss function. On the proposed benchmark, our model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in rain Critical Success Index(CSI) on three datasets. Further-
more, it’s worth highlighting a significant milestone achieved by our model. In heavy rain, with im-
provements of 15.6% ,17.4% , and 31.8% in CSI over NWP predictions across respective datasets.
This underscores its potential to effectively mitigate substantial losses in the face of extreme weather
events.
2 D ATA AND METHODOLOGY
2.1 D ATASETS
Our benchmark PostRainBench is comprised of three datasets, two of which are sourced from prior
research, while the third is collected from a public challenge. The first dataset, called KoMet (Kim
et al., 2022), was collected in South Korea. The input data originates from GDAPS-KIM, a global
numerical weather prediction model that furnishes hourly forecasts for diverse atmospheric vari-
ables. The second dataset originates from Germany (Rojas-Campos et al., 2022). The input data
is derived from the COSMO-DE-EPS forecast (Peralta et al., 2012), which provides 143 variables
of the atmospheric state. The third dataset originates from China and provides hourly, 1 km ×1
km resolution, 3-hour grid point precipitation data for the rainy season. It includes 3-hour lead time
forecasts from a regional NWP model, with 28 surface and pressure level variables. We summarize
important details of the three datasets in the Table 3 and analyze the distribution of the observed pre-
cipitation data in Table 5. All three datasets exhibit significant imbalances, which presents a great
challenge to predict extreme weather scenarios.

2.2 T ASK DEFINITION
In this study, we consider optimizing the following model:
min
wn
L(w;D)≜E(Xt,yt)∼D[ℓ(yt;F(Xt,w))]o
(1)
whereLrepresents the objective function parameterized by won the dataset D. The input is NWP
predictions Xt, the corresponding ground-truth is rain observation ytat time t, and ℓdenotes the
loss function between the output of our proposed model F(·,w)and the ground-truth.
2.3 M ETHOD
As illustrated in Figure 1, our model can be divided into three parts. The first part is a channel
attention module (Woo et al., 2018). The second part is the Swin-Unet backbone (Cao et al.,
2022a) that generates linear projections. The third part is a multi-task learning branch with a hybrid
loss. We describe the first and third parts in detail below and put explanations of Swin-Unet in
Section A.3.1 and A.3.2.
We introduce the Channel Attention Module (CAM), which enables variable selection for a unified
NWP post-processing task, and models intricate relationships between variables. CAM aggregates
spatial information of a feature map by using both average-pooling and max-pooling operations,
generating two different spatial context descriptors: Fc
avgandFc
max. Both descriptors are forwarded
to a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to produce a channel attention map Mc∈RC×1×1.
For model optimization, we introduce a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and
weighted Cross-Entropy (CE) loss within a multi-task learning framework, incorporating two task
outputs ˜ycls,˜yregwith a hyperparameter α.
Utilizing dedicated classification and regression heads encourages the backbone to focus on learning
essential features for both tasks. As previously mentioned, precipitation forecasting grapples with
the challenge of highly imbalanced class distributions from a classification standpoint. To tackle
this issue, we apply class weights wcbased on the class distribution of each dataset. The full loss
function Lhybrid is defined as:
Lhybrid =Lcls+αLreg, L cls=hX
i=1wX
j=1(−MX
c=1wcytlog(˜ycls)), L reg=hX
i=1wX
j=1(˜yreg−yt)2

3 E XPERIMENTS
We compare our proposed Swin-Unet-based CAMT framework with various strong baselines,
including the NWP method, three deep learning models (ConvLSTM, UNet, MetNet). Swin-
Unet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) is a Unet-like Transformer. The tokenized image patches are fed
into the Swin Transformer-based (Liu et al., 2021) U-shaped Encoder-Decoder architecture with
skip connections for local-global semantic feature learning.
3.1 R ESULTS
As shown in Table 1, for the Korea dataset, our method demonstrates an improvement of 6.3%
in rain prediction CSI compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach, which is ConvLSTM.
We highlight that CAMT achieves a remarkable 15.6% improvement in heavy rain prediction CSI
over the NWP method, which is the first DL model to surpass NWP results for extreme weather
conditions.
For the Germany dataset, U-Net emerges as the top performer among previous models, particularly
excelling in rain CSI. Notably, our method achieves a 4.7% improvement over U-Net. When it
comes to heavy rain prediction, U-Net’s performance is limited and the NWP model outperforms

all previous DL models. Our method shows a substantial 17.4% improvement over NWP, marking
a significant advancement.
In the case of the China dataset, the NWP method demonstrates better performance in both rain
and heavy rain prediction compared to previous DL models. Our method achieves improvements of
26.8% and 31.8% over the NWP method under these two conditions, respectively.
3.2 A BLATION STUDY
We conduct an ablation study by systematically disabling certain components of our CAMT Com-
ponent and evaluating the CSI results for both rain and heavy rain in Table 2 . Specifically, we focus
on the weighted loss, multi-task learning, and channel attention modules as these are unique addi-
tions to the Swin-Unet backbone. In the first part, we use Swin-Unet with CAMT framework (a) as
a baseline and we disable each component in CAMT and demonstrate their respective outcomes. In
the second part, we use Swin-Unet without CAMT framework (e) as a baseline and we gradually
add each component to the model to understand its role.
Weigthed Loss (b) Without the weighted Loss in CAMT, there is a slight increase in rain CSI,
but heavy rain CSI shows a dominant 97.6% decrease. (f) Adding the weighted loss to Swin-Unet
results in a 6.0% decrease in rain CSI, but a significant improvement in heavy rain CSI.
Multi-Task Learning (c) Without multi-task learning, there is a 3.7% drop in rain CSI, along
with a notable 8.1% decrease in heavy rain CSI. (g) Incorporating multi-task learning into Swin-
Unet leads to a comparable performance of rain CSI but brings a slight increase in heavy rain CSI.
CAM (d) In the absence of CAM, we observe a 1.8% decrease in rain CSI and a significant 11.1%
decrease in heavy rain CSI. (h) The introduction of CAM into Swin-Unet leads to a rain CSI similar

to the baseline but demonstrates an impressive 11.5% improvement in heavy rain CSI. It indicates
that CAM is effective for selecting and modeling multiple weather variables.
Table 2: Ablation study on Germany dataset (Rojas-Campos et al., 2022). We disable components
of the framework in each experiment and report rain and heavy rain CSI as the evaluation metric.

Although Swin-Unet can achieve a relatively high CSI when used alone (e), it does not have the abil-
ity to predict heavy rain. Importantly, these three enhancements complement each other. Weighted
loss and multi-task learning are effective in improving simultaneous forecasting under the unbal-
anced distribution of light rain and heavy rain, while CAM provides comprehensive improvements.
4 C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce PostRainBench , a comprehensive multi-variable benchmark for NWP
post-processing-based precipitation forecasting and we present CAMT , Channel Attention En-
hanced Multi-task Learning framework with a specially designed weighted loss function. Our ap-
proach demonstrates outstanding performance improvements compared to the three baseline models
and the NWP method. In conclusion, our research provides novel insights into the challenging do-
main of highly imbalanced precipitation forecasting tasks. We believe our benchmark could help
advance the model development of the research community.

A.1 D ETAILED BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A.1.1 T ASK CHALLENGE
Post-NWP optimization poses several distinct challenges that distinguish it from typical weather
forecasting optimization problems and computer vision tasks.
Variable Selection and Modeling. In NWP, each pixel on the grid has various variables express-
ing the atmospheric feature state, which exhibit different statistical properties. This discrepancy
includes spatial dependence and interdependence among variables, which violate the crucial as-
sumption of identical and independently distributed data (Reichstein et al., 2019). The variables
exhibit high correlation among themselves and also possess a degree of noise. Previous approaches
have either used all available variables (Rojas-Campos et al., 2022) as input or relied on expert-based
variable selection (Kim et al., 2022), which did not fully leverage the modeling capabilities.
Class Imbalance. The distribution of precipitation exhibits a significant imbalance, making model
optimization challenging. A prior study (Shi et al., 2017) introduced WMSE, which assigned higher
weighting factors to minority classes. Another study (Cao et al., 2022b) combined a reweighting
loss with the MSE loss to mitigate the degradation in performance for majority classes. While these
approaches have succeeded in improving forecast indicators for the minority class (heavy rainfall),
they have inadvertently compromised the model’s performance on the majority class.
Lack of A Unified Benchmark. A previous study, KoMet (Kim et al., 2022), introduced a small
dataset covering the time span of two years. Due to the limited data samples, models trained solely
on such datasets may risk overfitting to specific data characteristics. Furthermore, KoMet only
selected a subset of NWP variables as input. In contrast, another study (Rojas-Campos et al., 2022)
utilized all 143 available NWP variables as input.
The limited size of the dataset, along with the lack of a standardized method for selecting variables,
hinders research progress in improving the NWP post-processing task.
A.1.2 T ASK FORMULATION
In this study, we consider optimizing the following model:
min
wn
L(w;D)≜E(Xt,yt)∼D[ℓ(yt;F(Xt,w))]o
(3)
where Lrepresents the objective function parameterized by won the dataset D. As shown in
Figure 6, the input is NWP predictions Xt, the corresponding ground-truth is rain observation yt
at time t, and ℓdenotes the loss function between the output of our proposed model F(·,w)and
the ground-truth. The NWP predictions Xtare derived from the NWP model at time t−L−τ,
constituting a sequence denoted as Xt=x(t−L),x(t−L+1),···,x(t−2),x(t−1), where Lsignifies
the sequence length and τdenotes the lead time. Our post-process model F(·,w)takes the sequence
of NWP predictions Xtas input, aiming to predict a refined output ˜yt(at time t), where the rainfall
observations yt(at time t) sever as ground truth to train our model. In our multi-task framework, the
prediction of our model at time tis defined as a classification forecast ˜yclsand a regression forecast

A.2 D ATASET DETAILS
A.2.1 P OSTRAINBENCH DATASET SUMMARY
To address the issues of limited dataset size and the lack of a standardized criterion for variable
selection, we introduce a unified benchmark comprising three datasets. Two of these datasets are
sourced from prior research, while the third is collected from a public challenge. We describe our
processing and standardization of the datasets below.
The first dataset, called KoMet (Kim et al., 2022), was collected in South Korea. The input data
originates from GDAPS-KIM, a global numerical weather prediction model that furnishes hourly
forecasts for diverse atmospheric variables. GDAPS-KIM operates at a spatial resolution of 12 km
×12 km, resulting in a spatial dimension of 65 ×50. The variables fall into two categories: pressure
level variables and surface variables. For benchmarking purposes, 12 variables out of the 122 are
selected according to Korean experts, and we follow this setting in our paper.
The second dataset originates from Germany (Rojas-Campos et al., 2022). This dataset covers the
period from 2011 to 2018 and is confined to a selected area in West Germany. The input data is
derived from the COSMO-DE-EPS forecast (Peralta et al., 2012), which provides 143 variables of
the atmospheric state. For this dataset, the forecast with a 3-hour lead time is selected. A detailed
description of the COSMO-DE-EPS output can be found in Sch ¨attler et al. (2008). The input data
has a spatial resolution of 36 ×36, while the output data is available at a resolution of 72 ×72. To
give a fair comparison between various algorithms, we perform interpolation on both to bring them
to a consistent resolution of 64 ×64.
The third dataset originates from China and provides hourly, 1 km ×1 km resolution, 3-hour grid
point precipitation data for the rainy season. This dataset spans from April to October in both 2020
and 2021. Additionally, it includes 3-hour lead time forecasts from a regional NWP model, with 28
9Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
surface and pressure level variables such as 2-meter temperature, 2-meter dew point temperature,
10-meter u and v wind components, and CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) values. For
all variables provided, please refer to Table 4. Each time frame in this dataset covers a substantial
spatial area, featuring a grid size of 430 ×815. To maintain consistency, we interpolate this dataset
to a more manageable 64 ×64 grid.
We summarize important details of the three datasets in the Table 3.
For Korea dataset and Germany dataset variables, please refer to previous research. For China
dataset variables, please refer to Table 4.

A.2.3 D ATA DISTRIBUTION
We analyze the distribution of the observed precipitation data, which serves as the ground truth,
across the three datasets. In accordance with the framework outlined in Kim et al. (2022), we
categorize precipitation into two types: rain and heavy rain, each with its set of evaluation metrics
and frame this forecasting problem as a three-class classification task. It is important to note that
the threshold for defining heavy rain can vary by location due to differences in rainfall frequency
influenced by geographical and climatic factors.
In Germany dataset, Rojas-Campos et al. (2022) explores various thresholds including 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2,
and 5, we adopt a rain threshold of 10−5mm/h since its distribution is concentrated in [0,1] and we
adhere to the rain threshold of 0.1mm/h adopted by Kim et al. (2022) In Korea dataset, we adhere
previous heavy rain threshold of 10mm/h and opt for a unified threshold of 2mm/h in another two
datasets, enabling a more equitable comparison. The distribution and the rain categorization of the
three datasets are presented in Table 5.
It is evident that all three datasets exhibit significant imbalances, which presents a great challenge to
predict extreme weather scenarios.

A.3.1 B ASELINES
U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015) is a model specifically crafted to address the challenge of im-
age segmentation in biomedical images. It excels in capturing essential features in a reduced-
dimensional form during the propagation phase of its encoder component.

ConvLSTM (Shi et al., 2015; 2017) is a hybrid model integrating LSTM and convolutional op-
erations. LSTMs are tailored for capturing temporal relationships, while convolutional operations
specialize in modeling spatial patterns. This combination allows ConvLSTM to effectively model
both temporal and spatial relationships within sequences of images.
MetNet (Sønderby et al., 2020) incorporates a spatial downsampler, achieved through convolutional
layers, to reduce input size. Its temporal encoder employs the ConvLSTM structure, enabling the
capture of spatial-temporal data on a per-pixel basis. The feature map subsequently undergoes self-
attention in the Spatial Aggregator to integrate global context, before being processed by a classifier
that outputs precipitation probabilities for each pixel.
Swin-Unet (Cao et al., 2022a) is a Unet-like Transformer. The tokenized image patches are fed
into the Swin Transformer-based U-shaped Encoder-Decoder architecture with skip connections
for local-global semantic feature learning. Specifically, it uses hierarchical Swin Transformer (Liu
et al., 2021) with shifted windows as the encoder and decoder. The overall architecture of Swin-
Unet is presented in Figure 3. In our multi-task framework, two linear projection layers are applied
to output the pixel-level classification and regression predictions. ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)
apply a pure Transformer architecture on image data, by proposing a simple, yet efficient image
tokenization strategy. We follow previous work (Tarasiou et al., 2023) to employ Transformers for
dense prediction.
FourCastNet (Pathak et al., 2022) is a data-driven global weather forecasting model known for its
rapid and accurate predictions, excelling in high-resolution forecasting of complex meteorological
variables, which is based on Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO).
A.3.2 S WIN-UNET ARCHITECTURE
The overall architecture of Swin-Unet is presented in Figure 3. In our multi-task framework, two
linear projection layers are applied to output the pixel-level classification and regression predictions.
A.3.3 C HANNEL ATTENTION MODULE
CAM aggregates spatial information of a feature map by using both average-pooling and max-
pooling operations, generating two different spatial context descriptors: Fc
avgandFc
max. Both
descriptors are forwarded to a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to produce a channel attention
mapMc∈RC×1×1. To reduce parameter overhead, the hidden activation size is set to RC/r×1×1,
where ris the reduction ratio. After the shared network, the two output feature vectors are merged
with element-wise summation. We employ a residual connection (He et al., 2016) by adding the
attention map to the original input, which serves as the input for the subsequent backbone stage. In
short, the channel attention is computed as:
Mc(F) =σ(MLP (AvgPool (F)) +MLP (MaxPool (F)))
=σ(W1(W0(Fc
avg)) +W1(W0(Fc
max))),(6)

where σdenotes the sigmoid function, W0∈RC/r×C, andW1∈RC×C/r. We choose r= 16 .
Note that the MLP weights, W0andW1, are shared for both inputs and the activation function is
followed by W0. We choose GeLU activation function instead of ReLU.
The resulting feature maps are then input to the Swin-Unet backbone, as shown in Figure 1.
The backbone model is connected to a classification head and a regression head, which are learned
under our proposed multitask learning framework as described in the next section.
A.4 E VALUATION METRICS
In terms of evaluation, we adopt commonly used multi-class classification metrics for precipita-
tion forecasting by previous works (Kim et al., 2022). The evaluation metrics are calculated based
on the number of true positives ( TPk), false positives ( FPk), true negatives ( TNk), and false nega-
tives ( FNk) for some generic class k. We describe all the metrics we consider as follows:
•Critical Success Index (CSI) (Donaldson et al., 1975) is a categorical metric that takes
into account various elements of the confusion matrix, similar with F1-score having the
value asTPk
TPk+FNk+FPk.
•Heidke Skill Score (HSS) (Woo & Wong, 2017) as stated by (Hogan et al., 2010), is more
equitable in evaluating the forecasting performance. Higher HSS means better performance
and a positive HSS indicates that a forecast is better than a random-based forecast. HSS is
calculated as2×(TPk×TNk−FNk×FPk)
FP2
k+TN2
k+2×TPk×FNk+(FPk+TNk)(TPk+FPk).
•Accuracy (ACC) provides a comprehensive assessment of how accurately the model pre-
dicts outcomes across the entire dataset.
•Probability of Detection (POD) is a recall calculated asTPk
TPk+FPK.
•False Alarm Ratio (FAR) (Barnes et al., 2009) represents the number of false alarms
in relation to the total number of warnings or alarms, indicating the probability of false
detection. It is computed asFNk
TPk+FNk
•Bias quantifies the ratio between the observed frequency of a phenomenon and the fre-
quency predicted by the forecasting model.TPk+FPk
TPk+FNk. If the value is greater than 1, it
12Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
signifies that the forecast model predicts the occurrence more frequently than the actual
phenomenon. Consequently, a bias value closer to 1 indicates a more accurate forecast.
A.5 T RAINING DEAILS
The datasets are split into training, validation, and test sets following the configurations outlined in
previous studies. For the China dataset, we randomly partition the data into a 6:2:2 ratio. To ensure
consistency with prior studies, we select the model with the best CSI performance on the validation
set and report its performance on the test set. Each model is run with three different random seeds
for robust performance. We use the Adam optimizer for all models.
For the Korea dataset, baseline models are trained with a learning rate of 0.001 (as mentioned in Kim
et al. (2022)), while Swin-Unet models are trained with a learning rate of 0.0001. Consistent with
previous settings, a batch size of 1 is employed, and all models are trained for 50 epochs. We apply
a weight of [1, 5, 30] for the CE Loss. We utilize a hyperparameter αof 100 for the MSE Loss on
all datasets. For the Germany dataset, baseline models are trained with a learning rate of 0.001 (as
mentioned in Rojas-Campos et al. (2022)), whereas Swin-Unet models are trained with a learning
rate of 0.0001. The batch size remains consistent with previous settings at 20, and all models are
trained for 30 epochs. We utilize a class weight of [1, 5, 30]. For the China dataset, all models are
trained with a learning rate of 10−4for 100 epochs. The weight configuration used is [1, 15, 10].

For accuracy (Acc), our model performs lower than the baseline deep learning models but higher
than NWP. However, it’s important to note that accuracy may not provide realistic insights in an
extremely imbalanced case. If the model predicts all instances as no-rain, it could achieve a better
score. For probability of detection (Pod), our model ranks second only to NWP and outperforms
all deep learning models. In terms of critical success index (CSI) and Heidke skill score (HSS), our
model consistently outperforms the baseline models, as discussed earlier. The false alarm ratio (Far)
measures whether the forecasting model predicts an event more frequently than it actually occurs.
Our model exhibits higher but acceptable values in the rain category compared to other deep-learning
13Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
models, reflecting the trade-off between enhanced forecasting ability and overforecast. In the heavy
rain category, our model’s bias is less than 1 and closer to 1, indicating a more accurate forecast.
A.6.2 C OMPARISON WITH FOURCASTNET
For the Korea dataset, our model exhibits superior performance to FourCastNet in both rain CSI
and heavy rain CSI metrics, with a marginal shortfall in rain HSS, where it trails by 1.8% behind
FourCastNet. It is important to highlight that FourCastNet’s predictive capability does not surpass
that of NWP algorithms for heavy rain scenarios.
Regarding the Germany dataset, our model demonstrates an advancement over FourCastNet in all
metrics for both rain and heavy rain, whereas FourCastNet does not demonstrate an advantage over
NWP algorithms in heavy rain predictions.
For the China dataset, our model demonstrates comprehensive outperformance across all metrics
when compared to FourCastNet. While FourCastNet posts a modest 3.6% gain over NWP meth-
ods in heavy rain forecasting, our approach achieves a substantial 31.8% improvement, marking a
significant enhancement in predictive accuracy.
Table 7: Experiment result compared with FourCastNet. Each model undergoes three runs with
different random seeds, and we report the mean, standard deviation (std), and best performance in
terms of CSI and HSS. The best results are highlighted in bold . In the context of the results, ’ ↑’

A.6.3 A BLATION STUDY ON BACKBONE
We conduct another ablation study by replacing Swin-Unet backbone with ViT (Dosovitskiy et al.,
2020) backbone under our CAMT framework in Table 8.
For the Korea dataset, ViT outperforms Swin-Unet in rain CSI and HSS but shows a slight decrease
in heavy rain CSI. Importantly, its performance remains higher than that of NWP, which shows the
effectiveness of CAMT. For the Germany dataset, though its performance on rain CSI is limited, the
ViT model still demonstrates a remarkable performance in heavy rain CSI and surpasses NWP. For
the China dataset, ViT outperforms all baseline models and is only second to Swin-Unet.
These experiments highlight the potential of the ViT model. We also conduct experiments with
three baseline models but observe limited improvements. We believe that addressing the challenge
of imbalanced precipitation forecasting requires a more robust backbone and the use of our CAMT
framework, which incorporates multi-task information to enrich the learning process of this task.
A.7 Q UANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
A.7.1 P ERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT LEAD TIME ON KOREA DATASET
As shown in Figure 4, wthin the lead time interval of 6 to 20, we observe that the CSI for rain reaches
a peak at a lead time of 10 before exhibiting a declining trend, whereas the CSI for heavy rain peaks
at a lead time of 9, subsequently showing a fluctuating trajectory.

Expanding the analysis to a lead time range of 6 to 87, both rain and heavy rain CSI exhibit parallel
trends, with heavy rain demonstrating superior performance over extended lead times, likely reflec-
tive of inherent data characteristics. Across all evaluated lead times from 6 to 87, our model’s mean
performance is enhanced, underscoring the comprehensive superiority of our modeling approach.

A.7.2 V ALIDATION LOSS ON GERMANY DATASET
In our ablation study, we visualized the validation loss for different configurations of our model on
the Germany Dataset to assess the impact of each proposed component. The validation loss curve
for the standalone Swin-Unet displayed an upward trend, suggesting a potential for overfitting or an
insufficient capture of the dataset’s essential patterns. Conversely, the integration of our proposed
Channel Attention Module (CAM) and Weighted Loss (WL) resulted in a downward trend of the
loss over epochs, indicating effective learning of the data distribution and improved generalizability
of the model.
The CAM, with its targeted focus on salient features, and the WL, which addresses class imbalance,
have shown a discernible positive influence on the model’s learning process, as demonstrated by a
consistent reduction in validation loss. This reduction substantiates our method’s capability to tackle
the specific challenges associated with precipitation forecasting in imbalanced datasets.
Ultimately, the depicted loss curves validate our method’s proficiency in grasping the complexities
of the forecasting task, where the integrated components not only counteract overfitting but also
significantly bolster the model’s forecasting accuracy.
