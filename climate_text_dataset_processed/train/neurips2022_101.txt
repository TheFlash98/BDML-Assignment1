Abstract
With the advent of climate change and global warming, the Greenland Ice Sheet
(GrIS) has been melting at an alarming rate, losing over 215 Gt per yr, and ac-
counting for 10% of mean global sea level rise since the 1990s. It is imperative to
understand what dynamics are causing ice loss and influencing ice flow in order
to successfully project mass changes of ice sheets and associated sea level rise.
This work applies machine learning, ice thickness data, and horizontal ice velocity
measurements from satellite radar data to quantify the magnitudes and distributions
of the basal traction forces that are holding the GrIS back from flowing into the
ocean. Our approach uses a hybrid model: InSAR velocity data trains a linear
regression model, and these model coefficients are fed into a geophysical algo-
rithm to estimate basal tractions that capture relationships between the ice motion
and physical variables. Results indicate promising model performance and reveal
significant presence of large basal traction forces around the coastline of the GrIS.
1 Introduction
With the advent of climate change and global warming, ice sheets worldwide have been melting at
an alarming rate. The rate of ice mass loss has increased sixfold from 81 billion tons in the 1990’s
to 475 billion tons in the 2010s ( 10). The largest contributor to global ice loss is the Greenland Ice
Sheet (GrIS), losing over 215 Gt of ice per yr, and accounting for 10% of mean global sea level rise
since the 1990s ( 9). Rising sea levels have a wide array of disastrous impacts, including coastal
erosion, storm surges, flooding, spread of disease, and habitat loss that will only continue to worsen
in a warming climate ( 8). It is imperative to understand what dynamics are influencing ice loss and
ice flow in order to successfully project mass changes of the GrIS and associated sea level rise.
Recent advances in satellite remote sensing systems have produced high-resolution maps of the Earth,
making them an ideal tool for studying motion across large ice sheets. Two-pass Interferometric
Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) satellites use radar observations from multiple trips over an area of
interest to determine surface motion ( 12). In this work, we utilize high-resolution InSAR ice velocity
measurements of the GrIS derived from satellite imagery captured by the ESA’s Sentinel-1 fleet ( 7).
By inverting the data using a linear regression model, we quantify previously poorly-characterized
forces and distributions of basal tractions that are holding the GrIS back from flowing into the ocean.
Initial results reveal significant presence of large basal tractions forces around the coastline of the ice
sheet.
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.2 Previous Work
Prior researchers at Stony Brook University set out to uncover a relationship between gravitational
potential energy (GPE) and the velocity of viscous ice flow of the GrIs. They used GrIS bedrock and
ice elevations, derived from topographical data provided by the NOAA’s ETOPO1 dataset, to map a
vertically integrated gravitational potential energy (GPE) of the GrIS and associated ice velocity rates.
However, the GPE velocity calculations vastly overestimated the ground truth InSAR ice velocities,
and this difference was attributed to researchers assuming the ice was moving along a frictionless
base. These results reinforce the notion that the basal tractions between the ice and the bedrock
have a major influence over ice motion and ice velocity ( 5). However, these forces have been poorly
characterized as they remain buried beneath thousands of meters of ice ( 5). Our work extends prior
research to bridge the discrepancies between the GPE and InSAR ice velocities caused by the basal
tractions, providing us a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the forces holding the GrIS back
from flowing into the ocean. By employing machine learning and regression to perform an inversion,
we are able to use InSAR and GPE velocity data to infer basal tractions that could not have been
directly observed. Our novel approach uses a hybrid model: our velocity data is used to train a linear
regression model, and these model coefficients can be fed into a geophysical algorithm to estimate
distributions of basal traction forces that capture relationships between the ice motion and physical
variables. To our knowledge, this is the first AI-driven work separating GPE and basal traction forces
to understand ice sheet dynamics.
3 Methods
3.0.1 Dataset
Our data comes from two sources: ETOPO1 and Sentinel-1 radar satellite imagery. ETOPO1 provides
topographical ice and bedrock elevation measurements which are used to calculate the thickness
of the ice, and then generate gravitational potential energies (GPE) across the entire ice sheet ( 2).
Roughly 1800 Sentinel-1 scenes were used with InSAR feature tracking techniques to derive surface
horizontal ice velocity measurements of the GrIS ( 7). Both global-level datasets were parsed using
the geopandas library to focus on the GrIS from 2016-2017 (3).
3.0.2 Inversion Set Up
Our inversion equation is given by:
⃗d=Gm =vInSAR−vGPE
⃗dis our velocity field representing the difference between the InSAR and GPE velocities. To create
our design matrix, G, we partitioned the GrIS into 1000 grid cells (each with size 2 °x 2°) and
generated 3 basis functions ( εxx- Horizontal East and West effective body forces, εyy- Horizontal
North and South effective body-forces, and εxy- Shear effective body-forces) representing the ice’s
viscous thin-sheet responses for each cell. mis our linear-regression inversion model. Our goal to
find best linear combination Gm that predicts ⃗d.
3.0.3 Model
This is a linear inversion task, where the effective body-forces in one grid cell can have effects on its
surrounding cells and beyond. Thus, it requires a regression model. We use the least squares regression
method, shown to perform well in inversion tasks, and also employed Ridge (Tikhonov) and LASSO
regularization with loss functions defined as ||Gm−⃗d2+a2m∥1and||Gm−⃗d2+a2m∥2
2
respectively ( 4;6;11). Trade-off (L-curve) criterion determined our optimal smoothing parameter,
shown in Figures 1 and 2 with Figure 3 displaying performance metrics.
4 Results
Both the Ridge and LASSO regression models achieved a near identical fit to the velocity field,
achieving R2values of 0.999 and 0.985 respectively. The Ridge model predictions (green vectors)

model’s accuracy. Given the unusually high R2score, we are planning on testing this model on larger
datasets to verify model performance. We can now take the model’s coefficients and convert our
strain rate basis functions from Gto basal tractions through the geophysical algorithm described in
Finzel et al. ( 1). The Ridge basal traction predictions are plotted in Figure 5, and indicate that the
largest basal tractions responsible for holding the GrIS together lie on the coastline of the ice sheet.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this work, we developed an inversion algorithm for quantifying the magnitudes and distributions
of basal tractions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This is achieved via a hybrid approach, where our
velocity data trains a linear regression model, and these model coefficients are fed into a geophysical
algorithm to estimate basal tractions. This work has large implications on the ability to quantify basal
tractions and how they are keeping the GrIS together, and serves as a step towards modeling ice loss
and flux in relation to seawater intrusion, friction, and other forces. In the future, we hope to make
this model more accurate and generalizable to other ice sheets so that it can become a helpful tool for
climate scientists modelling rising sea levels. Our approach demonstrates the promise of applying
AI to gain a deeper understanding of ice sheets, giving us valuable insight towards rising sea levels
needed in the fight against climate change.
