Abstract
Streamflow observation data is vital for flood monitoring,
agricultural, and settlement planning. However, such stream-
flow data are commonly plagued with missing observations
due to various causes such as harsh environmental condi-
tions and constrained operational resources. This problem
is often more pervasive in under-resourced areas such as
Sub-Saharan Africa. In this work, we reconstruct streamflow
time series data through bias correction of the GEOGloWS
ECMWF streamflow service (GESS) forecasts at ten river
gauging stations in Benin Republic. We perform bias cor-
rection by fitting Quantile Mapping, Gaussian Process, and
Elastic Net regression in a constrained training period. We
show by simulating missingness in a testing period that GESS
forecasts have a significant bias that results in low predic-
tive skill over the ten Beninese stations. Our findings sug-
gest that overall bias correction by Elastic Net and Gaussian
Process regression achieves superior skill relative to tradi-
tional imputation by Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour,
and GESS lookup. The findings of this work provide a basis
for integrating global GESS streamflow data into operational
early-warning decision-making systems (e.g., flood alert) in
countries vulnerable to drought and flooding due to extreme
weather events.
Introduction
Discharge predictions are critical for decision-making in
many areas of climate change adaptation, including flood
and drought prevention, agricultural planning, and hydro-
electric power system operations (Kratzert et al. 2019). Pre-
dictions can be generated by physical and statistical models
of the hydrological process within the river basin (Adounkpe
et al. 2021). Regardless of the approach, observation data
is required to sufficiently calibrate the localised dynamics
within catchments. Model-based predictions are even more
essential in vulnerable and under-developed regions that are
less resilient to extreme weather events such as drought and
flooding. However, localised observations for hydrological

ure events (Hamzah et al. 2020). Physical sensor systems of-
ten endure harsh environmental conditions, destruction and
power outages (Tencaliec et al. 2015). These phenomena re-
sult in prolonged periods of missing or invalid observation
readings. In developing regions such as Benin Republic, the
effect of such missing data is further complemented by the
already sparse distribution of stream gauging stations (Har-
rigan et al. 2020a). Fitting statistical models based on in-
complete observation data results in inaccurate models that
do not capture the full dynamics of the underlying hydrolog-
ical processes (Hamzah et al. 2020). A more complete set of
streamflow data allows for greater confidence in the outputs
of hydrological models (Pigott 2001). Impuation of miss-
ing data therefore leads to much needed improved flood and
drought predictions in a climate change context where these
events are expected to increase in intensity and frequency
(Kalantari et al. 2018). Thus missing data imputation has be-
come a necessary first step in data preprocessing tasks (Pig-
ott 2001). Moreover, missing observations and the estima-
tion of streamflow at ungauged locations are two of the most
pervasive problems in the field of hydrology (Hamzah et al.
2020). Since the area of missing data imputation commands
a relatively vast amount of statistical literature, a wide va-
riety of techniques have been developed and applied with
different data requirements and accuracy (Little and Rubin
2019).
A simple approach to handling missing data is discarding
records where any missingness arises. Gill et al. (2007) show
that while deletion of missing data is common practice in hy-
drology, it is not necessarily optimal as significant amounts
of predictive information can be lost. On the other hand, sin-
gle imputation methods attempt to replace missing values
one feature at a time with a pre-specified summary statistic
(e.g. mean or median) of the complete data (Baraldi and En-
ders 2010). Regression-based methods such as imputation
by Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbours and Multilayer
perceptrons improve upon single imputation by exploiting
correlations between variables in complete data (Gao 2017;
Pantanowitz and Marwala 2009). Both regression and singleimputation can lead to biases in the resultant analysis when
the assumption that data are missing at random is violated
(Gao 2017). Multiple imputation methods such as Multivari-
ate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) reduce this
bias by replacing missing data points with predictions from
an ensemble of regressors obtained from multiple subsets of
the complete data (Van Buuren 2018).
Each of the imputation techniques above is used exten-
sively in hydrology. Hamzah et al. (2021) compares numer-
ous regression methods to reconstruct streamflow data in the
Malaysian Langat River Basin. Norazizi and Deni (2019)
employs MICE and expectation maximisation (EM) for the
imputation of rainfall data. Adeloye and Rustum (2012) and
Mwale, Adeloye, and Rustum (2012) propose the use of
self-organising maps (SOMs) for infilling streamflow data
at inadequately gauged basins in South West Nigeria and
the Shine river basin in Malawi. In this work, we propose
further augmenting regression imputation with data from
Global streamflow forecasting systems.
Global streamflow prediction systems present a poten-
tial solution to missing data and the sparse distribution of
stream gauge stations in developing countries. The Global
Flood Awareness System (GLoFAS) is one such system
jointly developed by the European Commission’s Joint Re-
search Center (JRC) and the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) (Harrigan et al.
2020b). GloFAS transforms numerical weather predictions
to surface runoff through the hydrology tiled ECMWF
scheme for surface exchanges over land (HTESSEL) model
(Sanchez Lozano et al. 2021). These surface runoff estimates
are then routed to stream networks using the LISFOOD river
routing scheme (Snow 2015; Harrigan et al. 2020b). A lim-
itation of the GloFAS system is that streamflow estimates
are only available at a low resolution of a 0.1-degree grid
cell (10 km2); this limits the applicability of GloFAS to
mainly large watersheds (Snow 2015; Souffront Alcantara
et al. 2019) .
The Group on Earth Observations Global Water and Sus-
tainability Initiative (GEOGloWS) attempts to address the
coarse resolution of GloFAS with the GEOGloWS ECMWF
streamflow service (GESS) (Ashby et al. 2021). The GESS
extends GloFAS to local sites using an updated digital
elevation model (DEM) that allows for increased resolu-
tions in areas of the world with narrow watersheds (Ashby
et al. 2021). Similar to GloFAS, runoff predictions from the
HTESSEL land surface model are further downscaled and
routed through a high-resolution stream network using the
Muskingum algorithm of the routing application for parallel-
discharge computation (RAPID) (Gill 1978).
While GloFAS and GESS provide much-needed stream-
flow data, localised calibration is still a significant challenge.
A global calibration of these systems is biased primarily
to developed regions with dense and complete observations
data (Ashby et al. 2021). Thus, the utility of streamflow fore-
casts from these systems can be significantly enhanced by
bias and variance correction to minimise systemic biases be-
tween model output and gauging station observations. Sta-
tistical Learning methods are broadly popular when learn-
ing transfer functions between global model forecasts andlocal observations (Piani et al. 2010; Rischard, Pillai, and
McKinnon 2018; Wang, Zhang, and Villarini 2021). Vari-
ous statistical learning methods have been put forward for
bias correction tasks, including penalised regression, Quan-
tile Mapping, Artificial Neural Networks and Gaussian Pro-
cesses (Xu and Liang 2021; Past ´en-Zapata et al. 2020; Hunt
et al. 2022).
This paper presents and evaluates the bias correction of
GESS river discharge estimates using statistical learning
methods on ten hydrological gauging stations in Benin Re-
public. The proposed bias correction methods can be utilised
to impute missing observation data with higher accuracy
than standalone GESS and are superior to complete data-
based Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbour imputation.

Methods
Study Area
For the purposes of this study, ten hydrological stations lo-
cated on the outlets of Benin’s major river basins were se-
lected: Athi ´em`e, Beterou, Bonou, Dom `e, Kaboua, Kompon-
gou, Koub ´eri, Lanta, Porga and Yakin. Benin’s basins are
not limited to only Benin’s administrative boundary but ex-
tend to its neighbouring countries: Togo, Burkina Faso andFigure 2: Missing data periods at each hydrological gauging station.
Nigeria. The Kouffo, Mono, Okpara, Ou ´em´e and Zou rivers
originate from central Benin and Togo and generally flow
into the Atlantic Ocean. The Alibori, M ´ekrou and Sota rivers
also originate from the centre of Benin but have their outlet
up north in the Niger river. The Pendjari river (sometimes
referred to as the Oti river) originates from Northern Benin
and flows into the V olta river in Togo and Ghana.
Data
In-situ hydrological data (daily river discharge record at ten
locations from 1980 to 2021) was acquired from Benin’s hy-
drological service, Direction G ´en´erale de l’Eau (DG-Eau).
The percentage of missing data for the selected hydrolog-
ical stations is 27.9%, with the station of Athi ´em`e having
the least and the Kompongou station having the most. Fig-
ure 2 shows in detail the periods of missing data for each
station. On the other hand, the GESS forecasts present no
missing data and provide daily river discharge data ranging
from 1979 to the present at targeted river sections (Ashby
et al. 2021).
Imputation Methods
We investigate streamflow imputation by bias-correcting
GESS forecasts. We propose an imputation scheme where
we replace a missing in-situ observation at time twith:
˜xt=h(x′
t) (1)
where x′the GESS forecast of streamflow at time t.his a
regressor trained on periods where xandx′are both avail-
able. We investigate settings where htakes various forms,
including; a simple lookup from GESS, a quantile mapping,
Elastic Net and Gaussian Process.
Gaussian processes (GPs) are nonparametric probabilis-
tic models, that are well known for regression problems (Co-
hen et al. 2020). A GP is a collection of random variables,where each of its finite subsets is jointly Gaussian (Ras-
mussen and Williams 2006). GPs are sufficiently defined by
a mean function µ(x′)and a kernel function k(x′
i,x′
j).

by maximising the log-marginal likelihood
logp(X|X′) = log N(µx′,Kx′x′+σ2

In this work, we use a multi-output formulation of the GP
where all ten stations share a squared exponential kernel,
thus allowing for implicit inference of connectivity relation-
ships between stations.
Elastic Net The elastic net is a penalised linear regression
model that employs weighted l1andl2norm regularisation
terms. The regularisation terms serve as conservative pri-
ors (bias towards zero) on the coefficients that prevent over-
fitting to training data. Similar to the GP, we utilised a multi-
output formulation of the Elastic Net that allows information
sharing between stations. In our imputation formulation;
˜xt=h(x′
t) =X′β+ϵ (5)
where βis a matrix of coefficients on the GESS predictions

with the hyperparametes λ1andλ2obtained by cross vali-
dation with the constraint λ1+λ2= 1. Given limited in-situ
data, the elastic net has the advantage of limiting over-fitting
the bias correction relative to a regularised regression.
Quantile Mapping Quantile Mapping (QM) is a well-
known method for bias correction of physical model output
(Maraun 2013; Ringard, Seyler, and Linguet 2017). In QM,
we seek to learn a mapping between the empirical cumu-
lative distribution functions (CDF) of the in-situ and GESS
prediction. In this case, the bias correction transfer function
is:
˜xt=h(x′
t) =F−1
XFX′(x′
t) (7)
Where F−1
Xis the inverse empirical CDF of the in-situ data
andFX′is the empirical CDF of the GESS data. Both em-
pirical CDFs are obtained during a specified training period.
Baselines We compare imputation by bias correction us-
ing the abovementioned methods to traditional regression
imputation methods that rely only on complete in-situ data.
We consider regression-based imputation by Random Forest
(RF) (Pantanowitz and Marwala 2009) and k-nearest neigh-
bours Hamzah et al. (2021) as our baselines.
Performance Evaluation
We measure the quality of the imputation using Kling-Gupta
Efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al. 2009), Nash-Sutcliffe Ef-
ficiency (NSE) (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) (Chai and Draxler 2014).
The KGE metric provides a diagnostically informative de-
composition of the NSE and RMSE. It facilitates the anal-
ysis of the relative importance of its different components
(correlation, bias and variability) in the context of hydro-
logical modelling. The NSE measures the ability to predict
variables different from the mean and gives the proportion of
the initial variance accounted for by the model. The RMSE
is frequently used to evaluate how closely the predicted val-
ues match the observed values based on the relative range of
the data.KGE = 1−s

to 1, with values close to 1 indicating good agreement. Sim-
ilarly to the KGE, the NSE values also range from −∞ to 1,
with the perfect model having the value 1. The RMSE values
range from 0 to ∞, with 0 implying the model has a perfect
fit.
Results and Discussion
We partition the data such that 60% of the period (1980/01-
2004/11) is for training and 40% is for (2004/11-2021/06)
testing. We evaluate the performance of the imputation
methods by randomly simulating missingness on the com-
plete testing data at rates of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 50%.
Figure 3 shows the mean KGE, NSE and RMSE of the im-
putation methods across gauging stations and levels of miss-
ingness. It can be seen that a simple lookup of the GESS pre-
dictions yields the worst imputation performance. The low
KGE and high RMSE values detailed in Table 1 suggest that
the GESS predictions have significant bias.
The hypothesis around significant bias in the GESS pre-
dictions is reinforced by the outperformance of the GP andMethodNSE RMSE

Elastic Net bias correction imputation. Importantly the im-
putation by bias correction yields better performance than
simply employing RF, KNN and MLP regressors on the
complete in-situ data. This can be reasonably expected as
there are limited periods where the data is jointly com-
plete for training the multiple imputation regressors. Thus
the GESS data provides the necessary signals regarding dis-
charge seasonality and hydrologic connectivity to enhance
imputation quality significantly.
Table 2 shows the KGE values at each of the stations at
a level 20% missingness. It can be seen that GESS yields
the best performance at Yankin and Kompongou stations.
Yankin and Kompongou had the highest prevalence of miss-
ing data at 47.67% and 59.48%, respectively. A possible rea-
son for this result is that, given the elevated levels of miss-
ingness at these stations, the complete data could not suffi-
ciently calibrate the bias correction. GP and Elastic Net im-
putation methods provide the best performance in eight of
the ten stations with the highest KGE values obtained at sta-
tions with highly complete data in the Athi ´em`e and Bonou
stations. QM as bias correction yields KGEs superior to mul-
tiple imputations by k-NN and RF, suggesting that bias cor-
rection would remain the most efficient approach when con-
strained by computational resources.
Figure 4 depicts the embedded bias in the GESS forecasts
at the Koub ´eri station. Figure 4 shows the resultant time se-
ries by looking up the missing data from the GESS. The pos-
itive bias in the GESS manifest in that GESS lookups lead
to new discharge extremes that are five times the extremes
recorded in the in-situ observations. In operational settings,

such significant positive biases can lead to false flood alerts
and sub-optimal use of already limited resources. The rem-
edy to this extreme bias is seen in Figure 5, where bias cor-
rection removes the significant positive bias while retaining
the seasonal periodicity in discharge.
Conclusion
We evaluated state-of-the-art imputation methods for
streamflow prediction, demonstrating the need and impor-
tance for bias-correcting GEOGloWS ECMWF streamflow
service (GESS) streamflow forecast information. Our find-
ings show that the bias introduced by GESS forecasts can
be significant and result in possible false flooding alerts. We
minimize such bias using QM, GP, and Elastic Net regres-
sions trained in periods where in-situ observations are avail-
able. The resultant imputation under simulated missingness
shows that GESS bias correction outperforms train k-NN
and RF imputation trained on available data alone.
Our findings enhance decision-making based on stream-
flow model-based forecasts, reducing bias introduced by
missing in-situ data. The reliance on such forecasts is high,
particularly in areas where data collection is too costly,
under-resourced, or not possible across Sub-Saharan Africa.
The proposed bias correction methodology integrates into
existing operational GESS forecasting and now enables real-
time flooding and drought monitoring with lead times of up
to 15 days. Continued work aims to enhance and expand
on the operational implementation of our bias-correction-
based methodology. Specifically, we aim to interpolate and
extrapolate the best-performing bias-correction model to un-
gauged areas. This is anticipated to vastly increase the utility
of GESS to large areas across Sub-Saharan Africa and Cen-
tral America that are currently ungauged. The robustness of
our proposed approach will also be further tested at the sea-
sonal scale to ensure that wet seasons and overall seasonal
dynamics are captured accurately.Stations
