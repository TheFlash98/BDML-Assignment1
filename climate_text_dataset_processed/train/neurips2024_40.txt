Abstract
The United States is one of the largest energy consumers per capita, which puts an 1
expectation on households to have adequate energy expenditures to keep up with 2
modern society. This adds additional stress on low-income households that may 3
need to limit energy use due to financial constraints. This paper investigates energy 4
burden, the ratio of household energy bills to household income, within the United 5
States West. Self-Organizing Maps, an unsupervised neural network, is used to 6
learn the indicators attributed to energy burden to inform public policy. This is 7
one of the first studies to consider environmental justice indicators, which include 8
outdoor air quality metrics and health disparities as energy burden indicators. The 9
results show significant ( p < 0.05) differences among high energy burden areas 10
and those with no energy burden for the environmental justice indicators. Thus, 11
beyond the socioeconomic hardships of marginalized communities, counties with 12
high energy burden suffer from environmental and health hazards, which will be 13
amplified under a changing climate. 14
1 Introduction 15
Governing bodies at the local, state, and federal levels have recognized the challenges climate 16
change brings for traditionally marginalized communities. However, how to create equitable and just 17
public policies at the confluence of climate change, energy, and disadvantaged communities remains 18
a complex question [ 1] with a dearth of research [ 2]. When creating public policy, meaningful 19
indicators, including social indicators, are vital to well-informed policies. Well-informed policies 20
are knowledge-influenced, meaning indicators have been thoroughly understood before creating the 21
policy. Otherwise, it is purely a political policy [ 3]. Since energy impacts almost every dimension of 22
modern society, when access to energy is limited, these impacts are compounded through housing, 23
mobility, health, work, education, and other facets of life [ 4]. Energy resource access plays a vital 24
role as compounded climate and electric infrastructure events occur. For example, the 2021 winter 25
blackout in Texas left approximately 10 million people without electricity for as long as multiple 26
days. Many news outlets reported that minority neighborhoods were disproportionately impacted 27
[5]. While there are many constructs regarding inequality in the energy ecosystem, reviewed and 28
compared in [4] and [6], this paper will focus on Energy Burden provided in Eq. 1. 29
Energy Burden (%) =Energy Bills ($)
Income ($)(1)
Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.The United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE) states that households experiencing an energy 30
burden of 6%or greater are considered to have a high energy burden, and households with an energy 31
burden of 10% or higher have a severe energy burden. These metrics were created based on the notion 32
that a household should not spend more than 30% of the income on housing expenses, and utility 33
costs should not exceed 20% of housing expenses, although this often does not include transportation 34
energy or water use [ 7,8]. A high energy burden can result in shutoffs and “bundled burdens” such 35
that economic trade-offs create a cumulative household risk. Trade-offs include living in comprised 36
homes and the “heat or eat” phenomena, which refers to the co-occurrence of food and energy 37
insecurity [ 9]. However, co-occurrences are not limited to energy and food but include medical care, 38
proper shelter, and other life necessities. As global air temperatures continue to rise due to climate 39
change, there is a precedent to predict how household energy use will change. An example is the 2022 40
California Heatwave, which led to the California Independent System Operator setting a new peak 41
demand. The Western Interconnection also set a new peak demand in July 2024 [ 10]. Findings from 42
[11] suggest that many areas will experience an increase in air conditioning (AC) expenditures but a 43
decrease in heating expenditures as year-round temperatures are projected to increase. This creates 44
a continuous need for increased use and adoption of AC in residential buildings [ 12]. However, 45
previous studies have often concentrated on the interconnections of heating energy consumption, 46
poverty, and residential dwellings. As such, this study focuses on the summer season, using summer 47
temperature data and investigating AC types in residential buildings in the U.S. Western Census 48
Region. The contributions of this study include: 49
•Understanding the implications of energy burden beyond energy use, social demographics, 50
and income. These metrics are included in a majority of previous studies. While this paper 51
does include those metrics, it is one of the first studies to include environmental justice 52
indicators and resiliency measures. 53
•The development of a data-driven framework to identify energy burden indicators that are 54
flexible to new inputs or different geographic regions. 55
•Poses to answer the question “What indicators are important in developing well-informed 56
policies for energy burdened areas?" 57
2 Methods 58
The purpose of using unsupervised learning is to form groupings using general patterns and distri- 59
butions related to indicators attributed to energy burden. These groupings could be used to better 60
understand the characteristics linked to energy burden and the individuals most likely to experience 61
a high energy burden. The intent is that through the development of such groups or profiles, poli- 62
cymakers and energy assistance programs can be better informed of the demographics and general 63
characteristics of the individuals who will be impacted. A self-organizing map (SOM) is a form of 64
unsupervised neural network based on competitive learning that has the capability to non-linearly 65
map multi-dimensional data into two dimensions (2D). SOMs partition the data into nodes, which 66
can be thought of as clusters, that are arranged in a 2D rectangular grid. This allows a SOM to 67
embed a topological 2D manifold within a high-dimensional space. With each node, there is an 68
associated weight vector; this corresponds to the node’s position in the input space. Through an 69
iterative process, for each data point, xi, in the input data, the Euclidean distance to each node’s 70
weight vector is computed. The node whose weight vector is most similar to xiis called the Best 71
Matching Unit (BMU). The weights of the BMU and nodes within its neighborhood radius are then 72
adjusted toward the input data while the SOM nodes stay in a fixed position. This naturally preserves 73
and embeds a topological structure. Other clustering algorithms, such as k-means, allow the data to 74
move in clusters with no direct relationship to one another [ 13]. The topological structure of SOMs 75
is important, as counties near each other may have similar characteristics due to local and regional 76
policy implications. 77
To date, SOM’s have been implemented in energy related studies [ 14,15] as well as studies inves- 78
tigating social-demographic disparities [ 16]. This paper aims to integrate both energy and social 79

aspects to better understand energy burden for the first time to the author’s knowledge. For this study, 80
energy burden, latitude, and longitude were the inputs to the SOM, and the corresponding indicators 81
were extracted using the latitude and longitude. The SOM used a 3x4 grid, and nodes were then 82
grouped based on low, medium, and high rankings. Nodes with low energy burden are nodes that 83
have an average energy burden of 4%or lower. Medium rankings have an average of 5%and/or 84
contain a county with a high energy burden, while the high energy burden ranking nodes have an 85
average of 6%or higher. Here, energy burden is rounded to the nearest integer percentage. Each 86
indicator and the partitioned SOM nodes are then subjected to a Kruskal-Wallis test to determine 87
whether that indicator has the same distribution across all SOM nodes. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a 88
nonparametric equivalent to a one-way Analysis of Variance and is used in this study since it does 89
not assume a normal distribution. To test for significance, the resulting p-values are obtained. 90
3 Results 91
Figure 1: U.S. West Self Organizing MapData For a better understanding of indi- 92
cators for energy burden in the U.S. West, 93
states within the West census division are 94
considered. Census regions provide geo- 95
graphic frameworks at larger scales to per- 96
form statistical analysis, summarize data, 97
and offer varying physical and cultural ge- 98
ography [ 17]. This study uses 45 indicators 99
to understand influential indicators regard- 100
ing energy. A full summary of each indi- 101
cator may be found in the Supplemental 102
Material. A brief overview of the data cat- 103
egories used is provided in Table 1. The 104
data used in this study is at the county level, 105
given the constraints of obtaining secure, 106
publicly available data regarding socioe- 107
conomic status, residential dwellings, and 108
power outages. 109
Self-Organizing Maps The results for 110
the SOM are spatially shown in Figure 1. Here, nodes 1 and 2 are the high energy burden nodes 111
while nodes 4 and 11 are the medium nodes. Node 1 contains 18 counties from Montana, Idaho, and 112
Wyoming. Node 2 contains 25 counties from Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Node 4 contains 113
31 counties from Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Utah. Node 11 contains 40 counties 114
and is largely made up of Northern California, Nevada, and Southern Oregon. The nodes provide 115

insight into similar counties being near each other within states, as clusters are typically formed. The 116
spatial patterns are similar to findings in [ 24], which predicts areas in similar regions may experience 117
similar burdens. Overall, the metrics relating to air quality, age, education level, and minority status 118
are disproportionately higher in the nodes that correspond to high energy burden. Figure 2 provides 119
select results while the distribution for all indicators are provided in the Supplemental Material along 120
with the Kruskal-Wallis p-values. 121
Based on the Kruskal-Wallis results, 41 out of 45 indicators showed statistical significance ( p < 0.05) 122
among the SOM nodes, which means there are significant differences in the medians between the 123
SOM nodes. This is important as it could inform policymakers in terms of energy burdened areas and 124
also provides insight into geographic regions that could benefit from policy or aid as household energy 125
demand increases and energy remains an indispensable aspect of life. However, the nexus between 126
environmental justice, socioeconomic factors, housing, community resilience, and power outages 127
are not always independently associated, and results from this study show they disproportionately 128
impact counties that are already experiencing a high energy burden. Thus, results are advisable for 129
creating knowledge-informed policy as shown in Figure 3. Such policies and the knowledge acquired 130
through learning the indicators of energy burden create a path to climate action to avail and eliminate 131
the compounded burdens of climate change on marginalized communities. 132

Figure 3: Path to Knowledge Informed PolicyFor instance, indicators related to 133
air quality had higher values in 134

such as fossil fuel power plants, 141
and replacing those sources with 142
sustainable solutions, such as re- 143
newable energy, could improve 144
air quality and aide in solv- 145
ing other environmental injus- 146
tices such as polluted water from 147
power sources. Additionally, 148
these nodes also show higher percentages of the population in which poverty status is determined, a 149
high population of individuals over 64 years of age, a higher percentage of adults with less than a 150
high school education, and higher percentages of homes built prior to 1960. This further provides 151
insight into the types of policies and programs, such as energy assistance programs, alternative energy 152
rates, and weatherization programs that policy makers should consider. However, they must also 153
consider the influence of age, race, and the traits of those living in such households to maintain 154
equitably. Future studies should consider different methods to determine the SOM grid topology. 155
This framework could additionally be used on different census regions or different geographic regions 156
4such as states, voting districts, or census regions, which would be complementary to the development 157
of publicly available data at more granular geographic scales. 158
