Abstract
The global Biochar Industry has witnessed a surge in biochar production, with a
total of 350k mt/year production in 2023. With the pressing climate goals set and
the potential of Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) as a climate-relevant technology,
scaling up the number of new plants to over 1000 facilities per year by 2030
becomes imperative. However, such a massive scale-up presents not only technical
challenges but also control and regulation issues, ensuring maximal output of plants
while conforming to regulatory requirements.
In this paper, we present a novel method of optimizing the process of a biochar
plant based on machine learning methods. We show how a standard Random Forest
Regressor can be used to model the states of the pyrolysis machine, the physics
of which remains highly complex. This model then serves as a surrogate of the
machine – reproducing several key outcomes of the machine – in a numerical
optimization. This, in turn, could enable us to reduce NOx emissions – a key
regulatory goal in that industry – while achieving maximal output still. In a
preliminary test our approach shows remarkable results, proves to be applicable on
two different machines from different manufacturers, and can be implemented on
standard Internet of Things (IoT) devices more generally.
1 Introduction
The urgency of addressing climate change has led to a global call for innovative solutions that can
effectively mitigate ever-increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) (Anderson & Peters,
2016). In line with this imperative, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies emerged as a crucial
component of the climate action toolkit. CDR encompasses a spectrum of anthropogenic activities
aimed at the removal and durable storage of CO2 in geological, terrestrial, or oceanic reservoirs, as
well as in various products (Board et al., 2019). This approach holds the potential to not only suppress
emissions but also to achieve net-negative CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, essential for
achieving the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Smith et al., 2016). As highlighted

multiple champers so this image only shows a very basic design. For a more detailed representation
we encounter the reader to visit the websites (PYREG, 2024) and (ARTi, 2024).
in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working
Group III (Shukla et al., 2022), CDR strategies are indispensable, especially for counterbalancing
residual emissions that are difficult to eliminate through conventional means (Rogelj et al., 2018).
The deployment of CDR solutions, however, comes with its own set of challenges, particularly with
respect to feasibility and sustainability constraints, especially at larger scales. As outlined in the IPCC
AR6, upscaling CDR deployment necessitates the development of effective approaches, a task that
requires innovative technologies and strategies capable of both removing CO2 from the atmosphere
and ensuring its long-term storage. Among the array of CDR methods discussed in the report, biochar
stands out as a promising yet underexplored avenue.
Given the rapid growth in global biochar production from 95,000 metric tons per year in 2021 to
350,000 metric tons per year in 2023 (Initiative, 2023), this trend aligns with climate action goals,
positioning Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) as a potentially crucial climate-relevant technology. To
meet ambitious climate targets, scaling up the number of new BCR facilities to over 1000 per year by
2030 becomes imperative. The scale-up of BCR facilities, however, brings challenges in terms of
operation modes. Most prominent the emission control of the facilities needs to be under control to
be possible to operate the machine under the given emission limits.
In light of these challenges, this paper seeks to introduce an approach to predict the NOx emissions
of BCR plants, which can be seen as the most critical emission limit. Specifically, our focus lies in
demonstrating how machine learning algorithms can be harnessed to model the intricate states of
highly complex pyrolysis machines, thereby enabling real-time prediction of production values based
on the current operational state.
With this work, we relate to multiple strands of literature. Several papers use machine learning to
model biochar-related processes already, but is primarily interested in yield prediction (Li et al.,
2022; Hai et al., 2023). Similarly, in domains other than biochar, machine learning has successfully
been used to predict NOx emissions during physical and chemical processes, but remains focused
on coal-based power plants (Matsuzaki et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), diesel engines (Samosir et al.,
2024) and ammonia-hydrogen combustion (Chaturvedi et al., 2023) so far.
However, for predicting NOx emissions of biochar plants there is no comparable work yet. Beyond
this research gap, we also go a step further by subsequently using the predictions as surrogates during
an optimization procedure. While we focus on the prediction of NOx emissions here, the machine
learning approach can be easily expanded to predict multiple outcomes of the biochar process, and
potentially adapted to (physical and chemical) processes other than biochar production. Overall, we
thus believe we make a methodologically novel contribution to a timely and pressing issue.
22 Reactors: PRYEG and ARTi
Our approach was employed on two pyrolysis machines, manufactured by PYREG GmbH (PYREG,
2024) and ARTi (ARTi, 2024), exemplarily illustrated in Figure 1. These machines are equipped with
a range of sensors (see sensor symbol in the figure), including those for mass flow, moisture content,
and temperature, among others. Moreover, they offer diverse control settings (see screw symbol in
the figure), such as valve positions, ventilator adjustments, and oxygen flow control. It’s important to
note that in Figure 1, only select components of this machine are depicted. In the following, we refer
to the control settings as “machine states”, which serve as the input features for the model, while the
sensors represent the target values predicted by the model.
The operational process involves introducing various feedstocks (e.g. sewage sludge) from the
left side of the machine, which are subsequently conveyed to the reactor. Within this reactor, the
feedstock undergoes controlled pyrolysis under specific temperatures (from 600to1200◦C) and
different duration times. The resultant biochar is collected, and its moisture content is assessed as
part of the process.
Contrary to what is depicted in the picture, most pyrolysis machines on the market do not continuously
measure NOx values. In the case of the PYREG machine, NOx data was collected over two months
of operation, whereas for the ARTi machine, NOx measurements were only conducted over two days
using an external device. Consequently, predicting NOx values based solely on machine states offers
a viable solution for continuous emission monitoring.

To mitigate NOx emissions in biochar production, our initial strategy involved replicating the
feedstock-to-biochar conversion process. This was accomplished by leveraging sensor data and
machine states to construct a digital twin of the pyrolysis machine.
For this purpose, we employed a Random Forest Regressor (Ho, 1995) to predict various sensor
outputs (target values) based on the machine states (input features). Notably, the choice of Random
Forest was influenced by its documented success in optimizing operational parameters in indus-
trial settings (Alshraideh et al., 2020) and its proficiency in controlling and monitoring industrial
machinery (Chai & Zhao, 2020).
Figure 2a shows our training and evaluation pipeline. At its core is an IoT device integrated with
the machine, capable of altering machine states and capturing sensor data. This data, encompassing
both machine states and sensor readings, is transmitted to a server. The components installed
on the machine are indicated by grey boxes, while the brown boxes depict the server-based pre-
training pipeline. We orchestrated the entire process using Kedro (Alam et al., 2023) and scikit-
learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
Initially, a model pre-trained on the server utilized two years of historical machine operation data.
This data was structured into a flat table format suitable for Random Forest processing (Brownlee,
2020). We conducted data cleaning by removing missing values and normalizing the dataset. Then,
3a five-fold cross-validation (CV) was executed to determine optimal hyperparameters. This phase
involved evaluating various hyperparameters, selecting the combination that best predicted sensor
data from machine states. The hyperparameter tuning focused on the mean squared error, exploring
combinations of a number of estimators (10-100), min_samples_split (2-5) and min_samples_leaf
(1-3). The final model was then stored for subsequent deployment to the IoT device.
Post pre-training, the model was transferred to the IoT device. Due to the device’s limited resources,
we used a simplified Random Forest model (maximum tree depth of 2). In future iterations, we aim
to upgrade to a more robust computing solution.
To evaluate our approach, we conducted an initial testing phase using the PYREG reactor. During
this two-week period of continuous operation, various operational modes were tested to assess
performance under different conditions. The pre-trained model was retrained on the IoT device
every two hours using the most recent data, striking a balance between maintaining strong predictive
performance and not overloading the device’s processing capabilities.
In this initial test phase, our focus was on predicting machine states; for example, Figure 2b illustrates
the predicted reactor temperatures alongside the actual measured values. Since continuous NOx
measurements are not always available for these machines, we first evaluated our model using
consistently available sensor data.

Figure 3: Figure 3a and 3b: Show the prediction of NOx value using historical data from the PYREG
and the ARTi reactor respectively. Figure 3c shows the optimization path for the ARTi data to
minimize NOx and have CO2 and O2 (as two example values) constrained between CO2 0-10 % and
O2 0-20 %.
In the second testing phase, we focused on the primary objective of the study: predicting the NOx
values for the two machines. Figure 3a presents the NOx predictions based on two months of
continuous sensor data from the PYREG machine. This prediction was achieved using the same
pipeline, which was fine-tuned with additional machine states such as temperature data (see Figure 2b).
Similarly, Figure 3b illustrates the NOx predictions based on two days of external NOx measurements
performed on one of the ARTi reactors.
Both tests demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an R2 score of 0.97 for the PYREG
reactor and 0.84 for the ARTi reactor. The lower R2 score for the ARTi reactor is primarily attributed
to the limited amount of data available compared to the PYREG case.
Figure 3c highlights the relationship between O2 and CO2 concentration during the minimization of
NOx based on the ARTi data. The optimization was done by constraining the prediction of O2 and
CO2 of the Random Forest Regressor should be constrained by 0% < O2 < 10 % and 0% < O2 < 20
%. All constrains can be set by the user to obtain an optimization based on its needs.
5 Conclusion & Future Work
In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept approach for modeling the state of a pyrolysis machine
and predicting NOx values using machine learning, thereby enabling machine monitoring without
the need for continuous NOx sensors. We demonstrated the model’s performance on two different
4pyrolysis machines from distinct manufacturers, with both tests yielding promising results for
continuous NOx prediction.
By extending this approach to predict other metrics, such as throughput or biochar yield, it is possible
to develop an optimization model that simultaneously minimizes NOx emissions while maximizing
biochar production.
