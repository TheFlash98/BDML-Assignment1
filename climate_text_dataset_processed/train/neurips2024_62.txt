Abstract
In this work, we present a new unsupervised anomaly (outlier) detection (AD)
methodusingthesliced-Wassersteinmetric. Thisfilteringtechniqueisconceptually
interesting for MLOps pipelines deploying machine learning models in critical
sectors, e.g., energy, as it offers a conservative data selection. Additionally, we
open the first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in
a northern climate. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method on synthetic

1 Introduction
Québec,Canada,standsasanoutlierintheelectricalgriddecarbonizationparadigm. Asthereisa

Québec,whilenottotallystrangertothistrend,isgenerallymostlycarbon-freethankstoitsimpressive
hydroelectric power capacity. One of its main challenges comes from its northern climate, its
reliance on electric baseboard heating systems for residential heating, and its unrestrictive home
insulationpolicies[ 1]. Duringglacialwinterdays,aselectricheatersareallrunningatonce,andpeak

peakpowerneeds,Hydro-Québec,thestate-ownedcompanyinchargeofelectricpowergeneration,
transmission,anddistribution,mustoperateitsonlyon-gridthermalpowerplantandimportelectricity
from neighbouring provinces and states. These imports are usually expensive and produce much
more greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to local energy sources [3].
To remediate this issue without solely relying on the deployment of new generation and transmission
infrastructures, demand response (DR) initiatives have flourished in the province [ 4]. Demand
response can be defined as changes in normal electrical power consumption patterns by end-use
customersinresponsetoasignal,e.g.,financialincentivesorcontrolsetpoints[ 5]. WithQuébec’s
long tradition of fixed electricity rates, one of its main DR mechanisms is critical peak rebates (CPR).
ResidentialcustomersenrolledinaCPRprogramreceivefinancialcompensationduringpre-specified
timeperiods,referredtoaschallenges,forreducingtheirenergyconsumptionwithrespecttotheir
expected baseload [ 6]. CPR programs are purely voluntary and virtually penalty-free. They thus
depend on consumers’ goodwill, motivation, and sensitivity. Yet, as we have seen in our work, CPR
events can be powerful tools for shifting power consumption before and after each event.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024We work with a variation of CPR, viz., localized CPR (LCPR), in which the events are called for
localized relief in the grid instead of being cast for the whole system. LCPR can diversify the
types of services offered by typical CPR programs, e.g., they can alleviate stress on local equipment
like substation transformers [ 7] or they can be paired with generation forecasts of distributed
energy resources (DERs), e.g., roof solar panels and private windfarms, to balance demand and
generation during peak hours. LCPR is highly underexplored in the literature and is a valuable
application to benchmark trustworthy machine learning (ML) models. Indeed, the higher spatial
granularity,thecriticalaspectofthetask,thedependenceonbehaviouraltendencies,andthelower
margin for error require the deployment of forecasting models that offer performance guarantees [ 8],
robustnesstonoise[ 9],interpretability[ 10],physicalconstraintssatisfaction[ 11],asenseofprediction
confidence [ 12,13], or a combination of them [ 14]. Being able to predict and utilize localized
peak-shaving potential in the electrical grid, through programs similar to LCPR, could accelerate the
integrationofDERsand,specificallyforQuébec,phaseoutitsdependenceonfossilenergy-based
imports. To the best of our knowledge, no published open-source datasets are showcasing either
LCPR or CPR schemes, in a northern climate.
As with most smart grid applications, dataset quality can highly influence the performance of ML
models when used for training. The adversarial properties stemming from the amalgam of numerical
errors, noise in sensor readings, telemetry issues, meter outages, and unusual extreme events can
disruptthepredictionqualityofMLmodels. Anomalydetection(AD)andoutlierfilteringarethus
primordial in a reliable ML pipeline [ 15]. Unsupervised AD methods are preferable as they do
not need human-made labels and their hyperparameters can be tuned simultaneously with other
ML models’ included in the loop. Popular unsupervised AD methods [ 16] include local outlier
factor (LOF) [ 17], isolation forest [ 18], k-nearest neighbours (KNN) [ 19], connectivity-based outlier
factor[20],andone-classsupportvectormachine(SVM)[ 21]. Thesemethodseitheruseclusteringor
local density to assign an outlier score. We are interested in optimal transport-based (OT) metrics for
AD. Reference [ 22] proposed a Wasserstein generative adversarial network for AD tasks and authors
from [23] have designed a differentiable training loss function using the Wasserstein metric for deep
classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no unsupervised OT method has been proposed yet for AD.
In this work, we address the lack of open-source datasets showcasing CPR demand response

participating in an LCPR program in Montréal, Québec, Canada2. These customers are spread in
three adjacent distribution substations. With it, we hope to stimulate research on trustworthy ML

2 Localized critical peak rebates in Québec
Québec’s CPR and LCPR programs have been carried out under the banner of Hilo, a division of
Hydro-Québec in charge of DR aggregation. Hilo, calls a DR challenge a day ahead of the event, and
users choose their degree of participation for the next day. Hilo subscribers are equipped with smart
thermostatsandtheirrespectiveheatingsetpointsarecontrolledbyHilo,accordingtoanagreed-upon
strategy, throughout the event. With the Hilo mobile application and different connected objects,
customers can program the response of their house to different scenes. For example, they can choose
theheatingsetpointofeachthermostatwhenthereisaDRevent,orwhennobodyishome. When
notified, smart thermostats pre-heat the house to augment user comfort during events which typically
last 4 hours: either between 6 AM and 10 AM or 5 PM and 9 PM. A maximum of 30 CPR events can

23 Open dataset
Description The dataset we share contains the aggregated hourly consumption of 197 anonymous
LCPR testers located in three substations. Additional hourly weather data and LCPR information are
also present. Table 1 details the features and the label. Note that we also provide cyclical encoding of
temporal features, e.g., month, day of the week, and hour. We remark that outliers and anomalies are
presentinthedatasetbecauseofmeteringandtelemetryissuesorevenblackouts,e.g.,anaberrant
(and impossible) 32.2 MWh energy consumption is registered at some point. We refer readers to
Appendix A for additional analyses and visualizations of the dataset’s features and labels.
Open data initiatives at Hydro-Québec The yearly energy demand in Québec should doubleby
2050,requiringanadditionalproductionof60TWhby2035andtheadditionof8to9GWofpeak
power to Québec’s 38 GW capacity [ 26]. Québec’s energy landscape must evolve rapidly to meet the
increasing demand and DR is a powerful tool to mitigate infrastructure growth.
Hydro-Québec recognizes the importance of sharing data to foster research, innovation, and informed
decision-making. Throughitsplateform3,itprovideshistoricalandreal-timedataonenergyproduction
and consumption in Québec as well as other datasets, e.g., geolocated hydrometeorological data from
its remote weather stations. This new dataset is Hydro-Québec’s first dedicated to DR research.

whereJ(U,V)representsallthepossiblejointdistributions 𝜋between UandV,z1and z2arethe
marginalsof UandV, respectively, andZisthesetofallpossiblevaluesof z1andz2[9]. Ingeneral,
computing the Wasserstein distance is of high computational complexity [ 28] except for some special
cases. For example, the Wasserstein distance for one-dimensional distributions has a closed-form
solution that can beefficientlyapproximated. Thesliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance is ametric that
makesuseofthispropertybycalculatinginfinitelymanylinearprojectionsofthehigh-dimensional
distributionontoone-dimensionaldistributionsandthencomputingtheaverageoftheWasserstein
distancebetweentheseone-dimensionalrepresentations[ 24,28]. Interestingly,itpossessessimilar
theoretical properties to the original Wasserstein distance while being computationally tractable [ 29].
The order-𝑡SW distance’s approximation under a Monte Carlo scheme is defined as:
𝑆𝑊∥·∥,𝑡(U,V)≈

references [24, 28] for in-depth mathematical explanations.
We now utilize this approximation ofthe sliced-Wasserstein distance to formulate a simple outlier
filter. Consider an empirical distribution ˆP𝑁=1

O𝑐⊆Ddenote the sets of outlier and inlier samples, respectively, under the perspective of the filter
and letD=O∪O𝑐⊂R𝑑be the available dataset. A vote is positive if the distance between the two
empirical distributions exceeds the threshold 𝜖 >0. A sample is labelled an outlier if the proportion
of positive votes is greater than the threshold 𝑝.

Thisfilterisinterestingforseveralreasons. Itisunsupervised,purelyanalytical,andusesawell-known
explainable mathematical distance to filter data points that seem out-of-sample under the SW metric.
The intuition is that we remove samples that are costly in the transportation plan when compared
to other random samples of the same distribution. We can use the voting percentage to measure
the algorithm’s confidence in its labelling. It is also parallelizable, as seen in our implementation
provided on our GitHub page4. Numerical results and figures are presented in Appendix B.
This method does not scale with large datasets as is: the SW distance computational burden increases
asbiggerdistributionsarecompared. Weproposeasmartsplittingmethodtoacceleratetheprocedure,
but we remark that the transportation plan between a distribution minus a sample and the same

tofilterout-of-sampledatapoints. But,because( SWAD)and( FEAD)usethesameprinciple,theyshare
similar classification patterns when 𝜖and𝜂are tuned accordingly, as can be seen in Figure 7.
5 Benchmark
We now propose a first benchmark on our LCPR dataset. Our goal is to predict the aggregated hourly
consumption at each substation in winter when peak demand is critical. To follow the literature [ 30],
and propose a simple yet meaningful benchmark, we implement a Gaussian process [ 31] in a rolling
horizonfashion. Samples datingfrom before2023-12-15 areused forhyperparameter tuningwhile
thosebetween2023-12-15and2024-04-15,duringthemostrecentwinterDRseason,areusedfor
testing. We train onemodel per weekand the trainingwindowsize isa hyperparameter tobe tuned.
The SW filter is used to preprocess data in the tuning phase and increase generalization in testing.
Ourmethodisinterestingbecauseitcanfilterclearout-of-samplepointswhileavoidingsparseLCPR
events that other methods could consider as local outliers. We refer interested readers to our GitHub
page for more details. Testing mean average errors (MAE) and root mean squared errors (RMSE) are
presented in Table 2 for each substation. See Appendix C for additional figures.
6 Closing remark
In this work, we present a new unsupervised outlier filter by leveraging the sliced-Wasserstein
metric. This filter is interesting for MLOps integration on applications where global outliers may
be adversarial to the prediction quality of trained models, e.g., smart grid data. We also hope to
stimulate research on trustworthy ML models in critical sectors by releasing the first open dataset
showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response schemes in a northern climate. This
dataset has a strong potential for benchmarking of such models as it opens a window to a real-world
critical application where accuracy and robustness are equally important. To get the ball rolling, we
provide a first benchmark by tuning simultaneously our SW filter and a Gaussian process.

A Detailed analysis of the dataset
In this section, we present some additional insights on the LCPR dataset. Figure 1 presents the
distributioncountofsomekeyfeaturesforeachsubstation. Weobservethatmeteorologicalfeaturesare
identical for each substation as they are geographically adjacent and located in dense neighborhoods.
Figure 1: Distribution of key features for each substation
Figure 2 shows a correlation heatmap of important features and label for each substation. We observe
that each substation follows the same general tendencies. We remark significant correlations between
the energy consumed, the month of the year, the outside temperatures, and the temperature setpoints.
ThisisalsohighlightedinFigure3whichpresentstheSpearmancoefficientsranking[ 32]between
each feature and the label. A positive sign indicates that both the label and the feature grow or
decrease in the same direction while a negative sign indicates an opposite direction. The coefficients
are ranked in decreasing importance from left to right.
To have a more nuanced analysis of the contribution of each feature to the output, we also provide in
Figure 4 an analysis of Shapley values of a trained extreme gradient boosting model ( XGBoost) [33]
for each substation. These analyses were realized with the Python package SHAP[34]. As we see,
some lower-ranked features, viz., the challenge flags, sometimes have a strong impact on the model’s
output even though their general impact is null.

SWfilter. WevarytheradiusoftheWassersteinballtoseehowthefilterbehaves. Theresultsare

filteronlythestatisticaloutliers. With 𝜖=0.05,weonlykeepthemajoritygroup. And,with 𝜖=0.01,
we only keep the samples closest to the barycenter of the majority group. This is very interesting in
a safe ML pipeline as we can tune the conservatism of the training dataset that is used at each run
during hyperparameter optimization.
In Figure 7, we compare different AD algorithms on synthetic datasets provided in scikit-learn ’s

Arrhythmia where the fast Euclidian approximation is underperforming. The SW filter’s strength
is that it considers the global distributional properties of the population to guide its labelling. We
