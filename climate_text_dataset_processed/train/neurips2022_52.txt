Abstract
Climate change is expected to aggravate wildÔ¨Åre activity through the exacerbation
of Ô¨Åre weather. Improving our capabilities to anticipate wildÔ¨Åres on a global scale
is of uttermost importance for mitigating their negative effects. In this work, we
create a global Ô¨Åre dataset and demonstrate a prototype for predicting the presence
of global burned areas on a sub-seasonal scale with the use of segmentation deep
learning models. Particularly, we present an open-access global analysis-ready
datacube, which contains a variety of variables related to the seasonal and sub-
seasonal Ô¨Åre drivers (climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, human-related variables),
as well as the historical burned areas and wildÔ¨Åre emissions for 2001-2021. We
train a deep learning model, which treats global wildÔ¨Åre forecasting as an image
segmentation task and skillfully predicts the presence of burned areas 8, 16, 32
and 64 days ahead of time. Our work motivates the use of deep learning for global
burned area forecasting and paves the way towards improved anticipation of global
wildÔ¨Åre patterns.
1 Introduction
Fire is a fundamental process in the Earth system, having an integral role in shaping the ecosystems
around the globe. Although it has traditionally been considered as a net carbon-neutral process in
the long-term, climate change can alter that with the exacerbation of Ô¨Åre weather, that exerts an
upwards pressure on global Ô¨Åre activity [ 1]. The expansion of Ô¨Åre to regions of evergreen forests
could weaken their status as carbon sinks [ 2,3], releasing the stored carbon into the atmosphere,
which in turn provides a feedback to climate change. Additionally, wildÔ¨Åres pose a major natural
hazard for societies globally causing loss of lives, properties, infrastructures and ecosystem services
[4,5]. With changing climate and human activity increasingly affecting Ô¨Åre regimes around the
world [ 6,7,1], it is crucial to improve our understanding and anticipation capabilities of the wildÔ¨Åre
phenomenon in the Earth system. This could foster the development of strategies to mitigate the
negative effects of wildÔ¨Åres and climate change, with better forestry management, infrastructure
resilience, disaster preparedness and development of more accurate warning systems.
Reichstein et al. [8]and Camps-Valls et al. [9]have argued to leverage the growing availability of
open Earth Observation (EO) data and the advances in Machine Learning (ML) and particularly
Deep Learning (DL) research to tackle Earth system problems. With respect to wildÔ¨Åre modeling,
there is a limited amount of open-access datasets that combine variables related to the Ô¨Åre drivers
and burned areas. Existing datasets are mostly focused on speciÔ¨Åc areas. For example, Kondylatos
Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.arXiv:2211.00534v2  [cs.LG]  6 Nov 2022et al. [10] present a dataset for daily wildÔ¨Åre forecasting in the Eastern Mediterranean, while Singla
et al. [11] and Graff [12] have published Ô¨Åre occurrence prediction datasets that cover the continental
US. Moreover, Huot et al. [13] have made available a Ô¨Åre spread dataset that also covers the US.
The limited number of published datasets, as well as the challenges occurring when framing wildÔ¨Åre
forecasting as an ML task [ 14], can be considered responsible for the limited amount of DL-related
works dealing with the problem. Huot et al. [15] use DL models that treat daily wildÔ¨Åre forecasting
in the US as a segmentation task. Kondylatos et al. [10] use a variety of DL models to forecast
Ô¨Åre danger in the Eastern Mediterranean, Yu et al. [16] predict monthly Ô¨Åre in Africa with multi-
layer perceptrons and highlight the contribution of oceanic indices. Chen et al. [17] predict global
Ô¨Åre emissions on a sub-seasonal to seasonal scale and lastly Zhang et al. [18] predict global Ô¨Åre
susceptibility on a monthly temporal resolution.
In this work, we present the SeasFire Cube, a Ô¨Årst of its kind curated global dataset (0.25x 0.25
x 8-day resolution) for wildÔ¨Åre modeling for years 2001-2021 [19] ; it combines historical burned
areas and carbon emissions from wildÔ¨Åres, which can be used as target variables, along with variables
related to the Ô¨Åre drivers (vegetation status, meteorological data, anthropogenic factors, oceanic
indices). To demonstrate a potential use of the dataset, we frame wildÔ¨Åre forecasting as an image
segmentation task and train UNET++[ 20] DL models to predict the presence of global burned
areas at different temporal horizons (8, 16, 32 and 64 days ahead) . The models demonstrate
forecasting skill that is evident both in the evaluation metrics and the visualisation of global prediction
maps.
2 Data and Methods
2.1 SeasFire Cube: A Datacube for Global WildÔ¨Åre Modeling
We gather global data related to the Ô¨Åre drivers (climate, vegetation, land cover, human presence),
the burned areas from three different datasets and wildÔ¨Åre emissions for years 2001 to 2021, at a
common spatio-temporal grid (0.25x 0.25x 8-day). We harmonize the data to create SeasFire
Cube [19], an analysis-ready, open-access datacube stored in a cloud-friendly Zarr format [21], that
can be equally used by Earth scientists and ML practitioners.
For a given timestep of the datacube, a variable carries information at a temporal resolution of the
next 8 days. For example, a variable on January 1st, contains aggregated values from January 1st to
January 8th. Additional details about the datacube are given in Appendix A.
The SeasFire cube can be used for many downstream tasks related to wildÔ¨Åre modeling, such as
forecasting burned area sizes or carbon emissions. In this study, we demonstrate how it can be used
to forecast the burned area patterns 8 to 64 days ahead of time.
For the modeling experiments that follow in the next sections, we choose a subset of the datacube
variables, and one burned area product, which covers the range of 20 years from Art√©s et al. [22],
resampled to the datacube‚Äôs grid. In total, 8 input variables are used based on their relevance and
usage in burned area prediction tasks from existing literature [ 23]: 2 EO variables from the MODIS
satellite (day land surface temperature [ 24] and the normalized difference vegetation index [ 25]), 6
climatic variables from the ERA5 dataset [ 26] (relative humidity, sea surface temperature, minimum
temperature, total precipitation and vapour pressure deÔ¨Åcit).

2.2 Methods
From the SeasFire cube, we extract a subset of the features for our experiments and treat the burned
area forecasting as a segmentation task where the input, target pairs have spatial dimensions 128 x
2128 pixels, or 32x 32. The 8 input variables, described previously (Section 2.1), are stacked in a
8x128x128 tensor and fed as input to a UNET++ model [ 20]. The target variable is chosen to be a
burnt mask at a future time step. As such, the UNET is trained to predict the presence of burned areas
at time t+husing the input variables at time t. For each pixel, the burned area mask signiÔ¨Åes the
presence or absence of a burned area. This simpliÔ¨Åes the ML task, by not taking into account the
actual burned area size of the cell. A visualization of the input-target variables is shown in Figure 1
and the ML pipeline in Figure 2.
To account for the imbalance between the negative (not burned) and the positive (burned) class, we
train on patches that include at least one burned area pixel. This discards about half of the examples,
mainly on polar regions or in the sea, ending up with 24,012 out of the 48,235 patches. Dealing with
a forecasting task, we do a time split using years from 2001 to 2017 for training (21,426 examples),
2018 for validation (1,275 examples) and 2019 for testing (1,311 examples). Among the total pixels
of those datasets, only about 1.6% are of the positive class (burned).
The forecasting lead time his in multiples of 8 days, which is the temporal resolution of the dataset.
A different model is trained for each of the four different forecast lead times ( h= 8, 16, 32, 64 days).
As evaluation metrics, we use the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) and F1-score,
which are appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic
(AUROC) is also reported to demonstrate that it is not a good Ô¨Åt for the speciÔ¨Åc problem.
Weekly Mean Seasonal Cycle baseline: We calculate the temporal average of burned area sizes for
each one of the weeks in a year, on the training years (2001 - 2018). Each patch on the validation and
test set is compared to an equal dimension patch that contains the average of the respective week of
the historical dataset. The AUPRC and the AUROC of the weekly averages are also reported.
We use the EfÔ¨ÅcientNet-b1 encoder [ 27], and train for 100 epochs with the cross entropy loss, which
is commonly used for segmentation tasks. The model with the best validation loss across the epochs
is kept for testing. Each experiment takes around 1.25 GPU hours on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB).

Figure 2: Pipeline diagram. The dataset is extracted from the datacube and fed to a UNET++ model
that is trained with the Cross Entropy loss (CE loss) with inputs valid at time tto predict the target
(presence of burned areas) on time t+h. The prediction shown is an actual prediction from the
validation set with h= 16 days for an area covering the Eastern Mediterranean and its surroundings.
3 Results
On the test set, we observe that the models achieve an AUPRC larger than 0.52 for all forecasting lead
times (Table 1). SigniÔ¨Åcantly, the models demonstrate a higher predictive skill than the weekly mean
seasonal cycle, which shows that they have learned more than merely the seasonality of burned area
patterns. The F1-score and the AUPRC are larger when the forecasting window is shorter. The high
AUROC, reaching 0.912 for the baseline, inÔ¨Çates the performance on such an imbalanced datasets.
The global predictions in the test year and the equivalent target maps (Figure 3) illustrate that the DL
models capture several large-scale burned area patterns. Notably, the models capture the change of
Ô¨Åre activity in eastern Europe and south-east Asia, as well as the shift in Ô¨Åre pattern from the southern
to the northern African savanna. Although burned area size is not explicitly modelled, Africa, which
accounts for around 70% of the global burned areas [ 16], seems to dominate the focus of the model. It
3is not clear whether regional patterns are captured and it needs further future investigation. Moreover,
we see that the DL models have learned some recognisable patterns, for example the sea, the poles
and the Sahara desert are always predicted to be in low danger zones.

4 Discussion
Our work demonstrates that segmentation DL models can skilfully predict global burned area patterns
from a snapshot of Ô¨Åre driver input data valid from 8 days to more than 2 months in advance. This
does not imply that this is the best architecture or setup for the task, but rather motivates the use of DL
for burned area forecasting and calls for future work that is facilitated by our curated analysis-ready
datacube [ 19]. Future work will enhance the pipeline to take into account time-series of the input
variables. Furthermore, we can use more predictors and measure their contribution. Rather than
predicting the presence of burned area, it could be more insightful to predict the actual burned area
size. Moreover, an extensive evaluation is appropriate; we want to quantify to what degree the DL
models capture the temporal variability of Ô¨Åre, including mega Ô¨Åres due to climate extremes, on
sub-seasonal, seasonal and annual scales and if they can also capture regional patterns in diverse
geographical locations. We can use metrics considering the temporal variability of burned areas [2].
With this demonstration on the SeasFire cube, we hope to spark the interest of the research community
for global wildÔ¨Åre modeling, an immensely complex and important task of our time. The datacube
includes a unique set of variables that will allow for a number of different modeling tasks. Indicatively,
time-series of oceanic indices allow to model spatio-temporal teleconnections. Human-related
variables such as population density and land cover can provide insights in the effects of humans on
wildÔ¨Åre at different temporal scales. Carbon emissions from wildÔ¨Åres are also part of the dataset and
can be used as to study the impact of wildÔ¨Åres on the global carbon cycle.
45 Conclusion
In the context of climate change, we believe it is important to move from measuring regional effects
in isolation to treating the Earth as one interconnected system. We present a versatile global dataset
that includes multiple variables to capture the multiple facets of the wildÔ¨Åres. The open-access
dataset is available to the community to analyse and model global wildÔ¨Åres from 2001 to 2021. As a
demonstration, we have framed the forecasting of burned areas as a segmentation task and showed
how DL models are skilful at forecasting global burned area patterns even 2 months in advance.

8A SeasFire Cube: A Global Dataset for Seasonal Fire Modeling
The SeasFire Cube [ 19] combines a variety of datasets at a common spatiotemporal grid to ease the
analysis of global wildÔ¨Åre activity. Models developed on the dataset may not be of direct operational
use due to the fact that the ERA5 reanalysis dataset is not available in real-time. Due to that, the
dataset is valuable to compare different approaches, but may overestimate their performance. For use
in production, it is suggested to switch to from ERA5 to archived forecasts.
