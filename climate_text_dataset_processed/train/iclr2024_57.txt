ABSTRACT
The power system is undergoing rapid changes to integrate a growing number
of intermittent renewable generators and facilitate the broader transition toward
sustainability. This increases the complexity of the power system in many as-
pects, including the power grid and its dynamics. As millions of consumers and
thousands of (volatile) generators are connected to the same synchronous grid, no
simple bottom-up models describing the dynamics are available on a continental
scale comprising all of these necessary details. Hence, to identify this unknown
power grid dynamics, we propose to leverage the Sparse Identification of Non-
linear Dynamics (SINDy) method. Thereby, we unveil the governing equations
underlying the dynamical system directly from data measurements. Investigating
the power grids of Iceland, Ireland and the Balearic islands as sample systems, we
observe structurally similar dynamics with remarkable differences in both quan-
titative and qualitative behavior. Overall, we show how complex, i.e. non-linear,
noisy, and time-dependent, dynamics can be identified straightforwardly.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Power systems are presently experiencing a swift shift toward a more environmentally sustainable
future, which is crucial in mitigating climate change. The stable functioning of our society relies
heavily on the electrical power system and the maintenance of a stable power grid, transporting
power from distributed generators to consumers. The power grid frequency,is a crucial indicator of
the equilibrium between electricity supply and demand, serving as a vital factor in the reliability
of power systems (Machowski et al., 2020). Power grid frequency typically remains within a few
percentage points of its reference value of 50 Hz or 60 Hz, respectively (Rydin Gorj ˜ao et al., 2020).
Deviations from these respective standard frequencies indicate an imbalance of the system and can
cause additional costs for grid operators as control systems need to be activated. Hence, understand-
ing, modeling, and forecasting power grid frequency dynamics and statistics is crucial (Rydin Gorj ˜ao
et al., 2020).
Power grids are complex systems: They are driven by both stochastic and deterministic influences,
i.e. our modelling has to cope with potentially time-dependent and noisy dynamics. Furthermore,
while many control laws are linear by design (Machowski et al., 2020), their interplay might lead
to non-linear effective equations (Oberhofer et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023). To address these chal-
lenges, we require an accessible, flexible, and data-driven approach, to derive linear and nonlinear
differential models of the power grid frequency.
In the current study, we aim to answer the question: Can Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynam-
ics (SINDy) (Brunton et al., 2016a) identify the complex dynamics of the power grid frequency?
The SINDy methodology estimates the most relevant parameters of the governing equations for
dynamical systems and has seen diverse applications across fields including stochastic dynamics,
physics-informed models, biological networks, control systems, and power system state estimation
(Boninsegna et al., 2018; Callaham et al., 2021; Champion et al., 2020; Mangan et al., 2016; Brunton
1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024
et al., 2016b; Stankovi ´c et al., 2020; Khazaei & Hosseinipour, 2023). However, many previously
considered (power) systems are comparatively simple dynamic systems. The main contribution of
the present paper is the focus on uniquely complex time series from power systems, both synthetic
and empirical. In contrast to dynamic systems such as the Lorenz attractor investigated in Brunton
et al. (2016a), the time series investigated in the present paper are characterized not only by non-
linearity but also include strong noise and time-dependent dynamics (Oberhofer et al., 2023). While
previous studies (Lore et al., 2023; Sch ¨on et al., 2022) only considered time-dependent coefficients
for SINDy, we advance the state of the art by including time as an explicit variable in the model.
This article is structured as follows. We first introduce a mathematical model that we use as a
description of the frequency dynamics and to generate validation data sets, Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, we
analyze data from three different power grids, noting distinct differences in the inferred dynamics.
We close with a discussion and outlook in Sec. 4. App. A provides a short introduction to SINDy
and in App. B we validate the SINDy model on the synthetic time series.
2 D ATA-DRIVEN MODEL
The basis for modeling the grid frequency is the aggregated swing equation Witthaut et al. (2022).
It is given as a linear stochastic differential equation:
dθ
dt=ω,
dω
dt=−cωω−cθθ+ ∆P(t) +ϵξ(t).(1)
The expression θrepresents the bulk angle of the voltage signal which in the following we abbreviate
as angle, and its bulk angular velocity ωis given by ω= 2π(f−fref), with the bulk frequency fand
reference frequency fref= 50 Hz. The power mismatch, i.e. the imbalance between generation and
demand, is given as ∆P. The symbols ϵ, and ξrepresent the noise amplitude and Gaussian white
noise function, respectively, which models the unforeseen influences, such as demand or generation
fluctuations. The terms −cωωand−cθθcombine the effects of damping and control. Specifically,
−cθθmodels an integral component, as often included in secondary control, while −cωωincludes
any proportional control effects (from either primary or secondary control). For simplicity, we refer
to these parameters as primary control parameter cωand secondary control parameter cθ. Typically,
the magnitude of the primary control parameter is much larger than the secondary control parameter,
i.e.,cω≫cθ. Detailed properties and explanations of the swing equation and its approximations,
parameters, and modeling methods are extensively explained in Gorjao et al. (2020) and Oberhofer
et al. (2023). We remark that it is a useful model for high-voltage transmission systems.
In the present paper, we investigate empirical data that has been recorded with electrical data
recorders (Jumar et al., 2021; Rydin Gorj ˜ao et al., 2020). In particular, we consider approximately
90 days of Balearic frequency data from 2019, along with several weeks of data from Ireland and
Iceland obtained at the end of 2021. To conduct a precise analysis, we eliminate any gaps in the
data, utilizing a continuous dataset. For the implementation of the models we use the Python imple-
mentation of SINDy de Silva et al. (2020); Kaptanoglu et al. (2022). See also Fig. 1 for an overview
of the procedure and (Wen, 2024) for code to reproduce our results.
3 SIND Y ON THE EMPIRICAL DATASET
Here, we utilize SINDy to infer the dynamics of empirical data from the Balearic islands, Ireland,
and Iceland with a one-second resolution. For an introduction to SINDy and a structured validation
and justification including noise and explicit time-dependency, see Appendices A and B respectively.
The mean value of the ωterm in thedθ
dtequation consistently converges close to 1across all three
regions, with a relatively narrow standard deviation. Conversely, the mean coefficients associated
with other terms within the equation are relatively small, significantly less than 10−4, which indi-
cates that the contribution of these terms is weaker than the ω-term. This aligns with our stochastic
differential equation, i.e. the inferred dynamics is coherent with the underlying mathematical model,
i.e. we obtaindθ
dt≈ω.
2Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024
Therefore, we focus on thedω
dtequation. In figure 2, we present a comparison of mean coefficients
derived from the SINDy models applied to the Balearic, Iceland and Ireland regions. This reflects the
variability of each coefficient, with longer bars (standard deviation) indicating greater uncertainty
or variability in the model across different datasets. We can see that the coefficient for θranges
from10−4s−2to10−5s−2and the coefficient for ωfalls within the interval of 10−2s−1to10−3s−1,
aligning notably well with the values obtained during our validation process. Hence, if we were
simply interested in estimating primary ( cω) and secondary control ( cθ)amplitudes, we would not
have needed SINDy.
More interesting is the analysis of the remaining terms: The coefficients of θωandω2stand out due
to their relatively high magnitude and significant standard deviation across the Balearic, Iceland and
Ireland regions. This indicates that non-linear relationships could play a critical role in the dynamics
of the power grid. These are not included in previous models (Oberhofer et al., 2023; Gorjao et al.,
2020). In addition, we note substantial impacts of time-dependency: Within a one-hour interval, the
contribution of the T-coefficient reaches an amplitude ranging from 10−3s−3to10−2s−3compared
to the 10−5s−2to10−4s−2range of the 1-coefficient. This means that the power mismatch ∆P
should be modeled as a time-dependent function, potentially including non-linear or mixed ( ωT)
terms as well.
4 D ISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this study, we demonstrate the enhanced capability of a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dy-
namics (SINDy) algorithm to accurately capture the complex behaviors of power grid frequency
dynamics in power systems. To validate this method we use the 1D-L-KM model(1-dimensional
linear Kramers-Moyal model) as a baseline model across three different synthetic datasets, see more
details in App. B.
Each dataset is generated with different conditions to test the robustness of SINDy and partitioned
into chunks corresponding to hourly intervals. Time Tis introduced as an explicit variable in the
modeling process, and the focus on absolute values of time-related coefficients underlines the algo-
rithm’s sensitivity. Upon the successful validation against synthetic datasets, the SINDy algorithm
is applied to real-world datasets obtained from Balearic, Ireland and Iceland. This study identifies
key dynamic relationships and potential weaknesses in the face of real-world data complexity.
The derived system of equations from SINDy reproduces some of the expected relationships between
the variables angle θand angular velocity ω. In particular, we closely approximate the coefficients
cωandcθ, particularly in the noise-free datasets. When noise and time dependence are introduced,
SINDy’s estimation exhibits slight deviations from the exact coefficient values but maintains the
correct sign and order of magnitude. SINDy also reproduces the observed dynamics for the empirical
data sets, allowing us to interpret the estimated coefficients in further detail. SINDy identifies several
nonlinear terms included in ω2andθω. Since ω2also emerges in the validation set with noise, it
is likely not based on a physical process, while θωmight be a nonlinearity present in the empirical
system.
Concluding, we present a version of SINDy that can infer complex (noisy, non-linear, time-
dependent) dynamics in power systems. Thereby, we offer a perspective to refine existing math-
ematical models. The data-driven approach allows flexibility to update models during the energy
transition or to infer models for previously unmodelled systems.
Having established the feasibility of symbolic approaches for power systems, we open up the re-
search field for numerous future activities. On the one hand, we could consider different optimiza-
tion algorithms or further modify the available basis functions in the symbolic regression (library
of functions of SINDy). Additionally, incorporating stochastic elements into the SINDy framework
could significantly improve its applicability, especially in scenarios where randomness and uncer-
tainty are present. Bayesian inference techniques could prove helpful for this (Course & Nair, 2023).
Furthermore, we could extend the SINDy algorithm to other data sets, including other power grids,
higher time resolutions of power grid frequency data or different power systems such as new power
hardware (De Carne et al., 2022).

A I NTRODUCTION TO SIND Y
In contrast to the model-based approach presented so far, SINDy is a procedure for extracting inter-
pretable and generalizable dynamical systems models from time series data. The SINDy algorithm
works by constructing a library of potential functions of the state variables, such as polynomials,
trigonometric functions, or any functions that might be appropriate for the system. It then uses
sparse regression to determine the smallest subset of these functions that most accurately predicts
the time derivatives of the state data. The resulting model is a system of ordinary differential equa-
tions (ODEs) that approximates the dynamics of the system, see Brunton et al. (2016a); Fasela et al.
(2022) for details, thus the stochastic elements in equation 1 cannot be directly assessed.
The optimization problem is formulated as:
Ξ = argmin
ˆΞΘ(X)ˆΞ−dX
dt2
2+λˆΞ
2. (2)
The term Ξrepresents the matrix of coefficients to be determined, Θ(X)is a library of functions
applied to the state variables X,dX
dtis the time derivative of the state variables, and we state
dX
dt=f(X)≈Θ(X)Ξ. The term λˆΞ
2denotes the L2 regularization Hoerl & Kennard (1970),
controlled by the parameter λ, which promotes sparsity in the coefficients Ξ. In our model, we use
λ= 0.05and set the threshold for the coefficients as 1·10−10.
B V ALIDATING SIND Y ON POWER GRID DYNAMICS
Before we infer unknown dynamics, we first demonstrate that SINDy correctly infers complex power
grid dynamics by utilizing synthetic datasets based on realistic parameters, effectively validating the
method. For this purpose, we use a stochastic data-driven model for equation equation 1, which is
created using parameter estimation of a Fokker-Planck equation. This model, denoted as 1D-L-KM
(1-dimensional linear Kramers-Moyal model), is extensively detailed in Gorjao et al. (2020) and
Oberhofer et al. (2023). In these studies, an aggregated swing equation is modeled, see equation
equation 1, which is used to generate synthetic time series with the help of the Euler-Maruyama
algorithm. For the validation of SINDy for power frequency dynamics, we consider three different
adaptions of the 1D-L-KM model.
The three synthetic data sets are characterized as follows:
1. Base case: linear parameters cωandcθ, step function as power mismatch ∆P, no noise
(ϵ= 0), see Sec. B.1,
2. Added noise: linear parameters cωandcθ, step function as power mismatch ∆P, with
Gaussian noise added to the dynamics ( ϵ >0), see Appendix B.2 for details.
3. Added time-dependency: linear parameters cωandcθ, Gaussian noise ( ϵ >0), and time-
dependent power mismatch ∆P(t), see Appendix B.3 for details.
The mean frequency exhibits jumps every hour due to market dispatch (Sch ¨afer et al., 2018). These
jumps arise from a mismatch between step-wise generation and a continuous load curve against the
step-wise generation schedules, ensuring system stability and efficiency Weissbach & Welfonder
(2009). Hence, we systematically partition our dataset into discrete chunks, each spanning a time
scale of one hour.
To include this external driving, we introduce time, denoted as T, as an additional feature in all
datasets. This addition transforms a non-autonomous system into an autonomous one. The power
mismatch ∆Pramps upwards for some hours and downwards for other hours, i.e. the time-
dependent features will have different signs at different hours of the day. To accommodate this
variability and capture the overall magnitude of time’s influence, we report the mean of the absolute
values of these coefficients.

B.1 L INEAR NOISE -FREE VALIDATION MODEL
To validate the SINDy approach for complex power grid data, we initially generate one noise-less
dataset from the 1D-L-KM model. The equation is shown below:
dω
dt=cωω+cθθ+P0, (3)
where P0is a piece-wise constant step function for 1-hour intervals. For creating synthetic time se-
ries we use values that are calculated in Oberhofer et al. (2023) by estimation of the Kramers-Moyal
coefficients (Gorj ˜ao & Meirinhos, 2019) of empirical time series from the Balearic grid. Specifi-
cally, the estimated values that are used as ground truth in our validation of SINDy for frequency
data for cωandcθare−2.95·10−2s−1and−4.52·10−5s−2respectively. For reasons of clarity, we
omit the physical units of all variables and parameters used in the equations of the present paper.
We consider a function library that consists of polynomials up to a degree of 2. Terms proportional
toT,T2,θT, and ωTfluctuate between positive and negative values, likely due to fluctuations in
generation and demand. Thus, we represent these with a ±and indicate their magnitude, which is
small to the other polynomials. The governing equations from SINDy are obtained as follows:

The system of equations derived from the SINDy method reveals a notable correlation between
the variables θandω. Specifically, in the equation fordθ
dt, approximates asdθ
dt≈ω, as ex-
pected. The coefficients cωandcθclosely approximate the true values, with cωbeing approxi-
mately −2.79·10−2s−1andcθas−5.19·10−5s−2. In addition, the constant term in the equation
fordω
dt, specifically 1.11·10−2s−2, corresponds to the mean value of P0as defined in our equation
equation 3.
Moreover, the SINDy algorithm identifies additional terms in the equation, and coefficients asso-
ciated with these discovered terms are comparatively small. Importantly, these coefficients exhibit
magnitudes at least one order of magnitude smaller than the coefficients related to the principal terms
in the equations. Note that the typical range for |ω|is smaller than 1, while for |θ|it is<100. This
suggests that while these terms contribute to the overall model, their influence is relatively subtle
compared to the dominant effects represented by cωandcθ.
The derived governing equations from SINDy successfully capture the system dynamics in the ab-
sence of noise. Unfortunately, we cannot easily derive ”sparse” models as some of the relevant terms
(cθin particular) are small.
We also validate our SINDy algorithm on noisy and time-de-pendent systems, see Appendices B.2
and B.3 for details and Figure 1 for a demonstration. The noisy data is first smoothed with a Gaussian
filter Ito & Xiong (2000) to ensure stable results. Overall, we illustrate that SINDy is applicable for
identifying the relevant parameters of complex time series.

B.2 L INEAR VALIDATION MODEL INCLUDING NOISE
To assess the impact of stochastic elements on the performance of SINDy, we generate a dataset
that includes noise from the 1D-L-KM model. The equation governing this noise-inclusive dataset
is expressed as follows:
dω
dt=cωω+cθθ+P0+ϵξ. (4)
Before applying SINDy, a critical denoising step is undertaken to enhance the accuracy and stability
of the algorithm. In this context, the Gaussian filter method is employed for denoising.
The kernel width parameter σadjusts the smoothness of the filtered signal, with lower values result-
ing in less smoothing and higher values producing more smoothing. To ascertain the most appropri-
ateσvalue for the Gaussian filter, We calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original
ωand the simulated ωfor various σvalues. The MSE indicates the accuracy of the simulations, with
lower values suggesting a closer match to the original data. This analysis aids in determining the
optimal parameter for the Gaussian filter, ensuring an effective denoising process and, consequently,
a more accurate and stable SINDy model, especially for the analysis of the empirical data in Sec. 3.
Figure 3 presents that the MSE value is the smallest for σ= 60 . Therefore, σ= 60 is used to
denoising the synthetic data and empirical data.
The expression for the governing equation derived from the SINDy method is as follows:
dθ
dt= 1.64·10−5s−1−1.65·10−5s−1·θ+ 9.99·10−1·ω± O(10−6)s−2·T
+O(10−9)s−1·θ2+O(10−6)·θω± O(10−8)s−2·θT−1.54·10−4s·ω2
± O(10−6)s−1·ωT± O(10−10)s−3·T2
dω
dt= 3.21·10−5s−2−3.36·10−5s−2·θ−1.28·10−3s−1·ω± O(10−6)s−3·T
+O(10−9)s−2·θ2+O(10−6)s−1·θω± O(10−8)s−3·θT−2.28·10−4·ω2
± O(10−6)s−2·ωT± O(10−10)s−4·T2
dT
dt= 1.00
In the presence of noise, while the coefficient of ωindθ
dtis accurately estimated, there is a slight devi-
ation in the estimated values of cωandcθindω
dtfrom their true coefficients. Specifically, in the noisy
data, the coefficient cωis estimated to be −1.28·10−3s−1, andcθis estimated as −3.36·10−5s−2.
The sign of both cωandcθaligns with their true coefficients, indicating the correct direction of
influence. However, both magnitudes are smaller, particularly for cθ. This suggests that noise and
followed filtering leads to an underestimation of the deterministic dynamics and hence less precise
determination of the coefficients’ true values.
B.3 L INEAR VALIDATION MODEL WITH NOISE AND TIME -DEPENDENT DRIVING
Finally, we examine the performance of SINDy on the linear model including noise and time-
dependent driving. This evaluation allows us to assess how well SINDy performs in capturing
the dynamics of a nonlinear system subjected to stochastic elements. The following equation is
presented:
dω
dt=cωω+cθθ+P0+P1t+ϵξ. (5)
The expression capturing the governing equation within the SINDy framework is given by:

Figure 3: As the smoothing parameter σincreases in the Gaussian filtering process, an upward
trend in Mean Squared Error (MSE) is observed. This suggests a potential divergence in simulation
accuracy with a higher degree of smoothing.

Again, we mostly reproduce the expected dynamics: The coefficient for ωindθ
dtand the correct
sign of cωandcθindω
dtare accurately captured. Further, the coefficient cωis estimated to be
−1.02·10−3s−1, andcθis estimated as −3.05·10−5s−2.
Additionally, we show the presence and significance of the ω2term in thedω
dtequation. In the
linear model with time-dependent data, the coefficient associated with ω2is specifically identified
as−1.72·10−3. The fact that this coefficient is of the same order as the coefficient associated with
the linear term ( ω) indicates that the quadratic term is not negligible and plays a substantial role
in influencing the dynamics ofdω
dt. This may be indicative of more complex, possibly nonlinear
behaviors in power systems.
