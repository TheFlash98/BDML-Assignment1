Abstract
Precipitation extremes are expected to become stronger and more frequent
in response to anthropogenic global warming. Accurately projecting the
ecological and socioeconomic impacts is an urgent task. Impact models are
developed and calibrated with observation-based data but rely on Earth
system model (ESM) output for future scenarios. ESMs, however, exhibit
significant biases in their output because they cannot fully resolve com-
plex cross-scale interactions of processes that produce precipitation can-
not. State-of-the-art bias correction methods only address errors in the
simulated frequency distributions, locally at every individual grid cell. Im-
proving unrealistic spatial patterns of the ESM output, which would re-
quire spatial context, has not been possible so far. Here we show that a
post-processing method based on physically constrained generative adver-
sarial networks (GANs) can correct biases of a state-of-the-art global ESM
both in local frequency distributions and in the spatial patterns at once.
While our method improves local frequency distributions similarly well to
a gold-standard ESM bias-adjustment framework, it strongly outperforms
existing methods in correcting spatial patterns. Our study highlights the
importance of physical constraints in neural networks for out-of-sample pre-
dictions in the context of climate change.
1 Introduction
The accurate projection of precipitation changes due to a warming of the atmosphere is
important for reliably assessing the impacts of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
Precipitation and particularly its extremes have large socio-economic impact (Kotz et al.,
2022). While precipitation and the frequency of extreme events are expected to increase
with the water-holding capacity of the warming atmosphere globally, local trends show
heterogeneous changes (Ali et al., 2018; Traxl et al., 2021).
Impact models are built to assess the hydrological, ecological, or socioeconomic impacts
and are typically developed and tuned using observation-based data as input. For future
projections, impact models rely on simulations from comprehensive Earth system model
(ESM) simulations that integrate the governing physical equations on discretized grid. The
numerical discretization, at comparable coarse grid size of typically 50 −200km is needed
to keep computational costs of global long-term simulations within reasonable bounds. In
turn, ESMs require approximations of processes on the smaller, unresolved spatial scales in
the form of parameterizations (Balaji et al., 2022).
These approximations can lead to systematic errors in the model precipitation, which results
from complex interactions of processes across many scales. The bias often manifests as

overly blurred images that do not resolve the characteristic high-frequency variability of
precipitation both in space and in time, and as an under- or overestimation of extremes.
Statistical post-processing methods, such as quantile mapping (Cannon et al., 2015; Lange,
2019), can adjust biases in the frequency distribution for each model grid cell individually.
Spatial patterns and correlations between grid cells are, however, not taken into account.
Neural networks, on the other hand, can use spatial context and have been successfully
applied to weather prediction and post-processing tasks (Gr¨ onquist et al., 2020; Rasp and
Thuerey, 2021; Ravuri et al., 2021; Pathak et al., 2022). Applying them to climate simula-
tions, however, poses different challenges.
Model simulations and observations diverge rapidly due to the chaotic nature of the atmo-
sphere, which limits weather forecast horizons. Nevertheless, in the context of numerical
weather prediction, forecasts can be directly compared to corresponding ground truth. In
the context of climate projections, however, simulated spatial fields of ESMs are unpaired
with observations. There is no observational ground truth for a given snapshot of an ESM
simulation, and one has to focus on statistical characteristics instead. This is one of the
fundamental differences between weather prediction and climate modelling.
Given these unpaired samples, cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (Zhu et al.,
2017; Hess et al., 2022) have emerged as powerful tools that can translate the “style” (e.g.
the small-scale variability) of precipitation fields from observations to the ESM output. The
ESM output is thereby made more realistic while the large-scale patterns (or “content”) are
preserved (see Fig. A1 for examples).
Our work extends previous studies in two key regards: (i) we apply the GAN-processing
to global high-resolution simulations from an ESM in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) that is used to inform policymakers (IPCC, 2021), (ii) we compare
the performance against a state-of-the-art bias correction framework ISIMIP3BASD (Lange,
2019) based on quantile mapping (QM), which can be considered the operational state-of-
the-art and thus represents a strong baseline.
2 Methodology
2.1 Training data
We use daily global precipitation output from the GFDL-ESM4 (Krasting et al., 2018) with
1◦horizontal spatial resolution. The GFDL-ESM4 model simulates the Earth system with a
general circulation model for the atmosphere and ocean and includes vegetation, biosphere
and ice sheets as model components. The ground truth W5E5v2 reanalysis product (Lange
et al., 2021) combines high-fidelity weather simulations with multiple observation sources
through data assimilation routines. We split the dataset into three periods for training
(1950-2000), validation (2001-2003), and testing (2004-2014).
2.2 Cycle-consistent Generative adversarial networks
We refer to Zhu et al. (2017); Hess et al. (2022) for a detailed description of the CycleGAN
architecture. In a nutshell, the CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) consists of two generator-
discriminator network pairs. The generators GandFlearn inverse transformations of
images between two domains XandY. The discriminators then have to classify whether
images are generated or drawn from a target distribution (see Goodfellow et al. (2014;
2020) for details). The two generators allow defining a cycle-consistency regularization that
constrains the training of the generators to preserve the overall content of the images, i.e.,
with
Lcycle(G, F) =Ex∼px(x)[||F(G(x))−x||1] +Ey∼py(y)[||G(F(y))−y||1]. (1)
It measures the error during a translation cycle of an image to the other domain and back.
The full loss function and training procedure are outlined in appendix B.

2.3 Physical constraints
We constrain the generator network to preserve the global precipitation sum from
the ESM during the CycleGAN-based post-processing. The constraint is imple-
mented as an additional network layer that rescales the generator output with ˜ yi=
yiPNgrid
i=1xi
/PNgrid
i=1yi
, where xiandyiare grid cell values of the generator input
and output, respectively, and Ngridis the number of grid cells. To enforce precipitation
not to have negative values, we additionally apply a ReLU activation function at the final
generator layer.
2.4 Baselines
We compare the CycleGAN performance, with and without the physical constraint, to the
ISIMIP3BASD bias correction framework (Lange, 2019) that is based on quantile mapping
(see Cannon et al. (2015) for more details), on bias-correcting the GFDL-ESM4 model w.r.t.
the W5E5 ground truth. We further construct a combination of the two methods, where
the output of the physically constrained GAN is processed by the ISIMIP3BASD method.
3 Results
We evaluate the model performance on two tasks and time scales: (i) correcting summary
statistics on decadal time scales with focus on frequency distributions and (ii) improving
spatial fields of daily precipitation.
3.1 Correcting summary statistics
We first compare the performances using latitude profiles of precipitation averaged in time
and over longitudes (see Fig. 1a). The analysis shows that the GFDL-ESM4 model exhibits a
pronounced peak at around 7◦S latitude - this double Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
is a well-known bias in many models (Tian and Dong, 2020). All post-processing methods
are able to reduce this bias, with ISIMIP3BASD and the GAN combination achieving the
best results. We further compute global histograms of relative frequencies, which show that
the GFDL-ESM4 model overestimates the occurrence of extreme events (see Fig. 1b); note
that this is relatively uncommon and past models typically underestimated extremes. All
considered post-processing methods can correct the frequencies of extreme events in the tail.
The global mean absolute error for annual and seasonal time series are reported in appendix
C, where the ISIMIP3BASD slightly outperforms the GAN post-processing. The combined
approach achieves the best overall results.
3.2 Improving spatial patterns
For evaluating improvements in spatial patterns, we compute radially averaged power spec-
tral densities (RAPSDs) for each spatial field, and average over the test set following Ravuri
et al. (2021) (see Fig. 2a). The RAPSDs show which spatial scales in the precipitation fields
are represented realistically compared to the ground truth. To highlight the differences,
we compute the absolute error between the logarithmically rescaled spectra (see Fig. 2b).
The GFDL-ESM4 model shows large deviations at wavelengths below 400km. The GANs
clearly outperform the ISIMIP3BASD baseline, the latter exhibiting larger errors towards
smaller wavelengths.
We further compute the fractal dimension using box-counting (Lovejoy et al., 1987; Meisel
et al., 1992) to evaluate the realisticness of the generated images (see Fig. A2). It essentially
characterizes how “wiggly” or fractal the lines are that separate precipitation patterns - a key
property of precipitation patterns. In agreement with the RAPSD analysis and qualitative
comparisons (see Fig. A1), we find that the GAN-based methods strongly outperform the
ISIMIP3BASD framework.

4 Discussion
We apply a novel bias correction method based on physically constrained CycleGANs to
global high-resolution ESM precipitation output. It can improve the simulation in the spatial
dimension on short times scales and in temporal summary statistics over long periods. The
former is not possible with state-of-the-art statistical post-processing methods.
We have introduced a physical constraint to preserve the global precipitation sum in the
ESM model. Enforcing this consistency is motivated by the observation that large-scale av-
erage trends can be expected to be modelled well in GFDL-ESM4. As shown in Fig. A3, the
constraint enables the GAN to generalize to predictions outside the training distribution,
realistically reproducing trends in an extreme warming scenario. Without the constraint,
physically unrealistic trends of decreasing precipitation averages in the tropics are found.
The summary statistics show that the unconstrained GAN performed better over the his-
torical period, perhaps due to the lack of constraint. Overall the combination of GAN and
quantile mapping has been found to perform better than either method alone.

The main advantage of the GAN-based post-processing is that spatial patterns, like the
characteristic small-scale precipitation variability, can be skillfully corrected. This is par-
ticularly important for localized extreme events. We believe there is great potential in
generative methods of unpaired image-to-image translations to very similar tasks of post-
processing Earth system model simulations.

Appendices
A Qualitative comparison
For a qualitative comparison, precipitation fields from the reanalysis ground truth W5E5v2,
GFDL-ESM4 model, CycleGAN and the ISIMIP3BASD baseline are shown in Fig. A1. The
fields are shown for the same date (14th October 2014) to illustrate the unpaired nature of
the training samples. The global fields have been cropped to the shown region to visualize
the small-scale variability. Besides some coincidental overlap of precipitation in central
Africa, the GFDL-ESM4 model precipitation does not agree with the W5E5v2 ground truth
on a grid cell level - as expected. The raw GFDL-ESM4 and the ISIMIP3BASD fields
appear too smooth and blurry compared to the W5E5v2 ground truth. The GAN-processed
precipitation field, on the other hand, shows realistic variability on small scales that is
visually indistinguishable from the observation-based W5E5v2 data.
B CycleGAN training
The generator and discriminator networks are fully convolutional and described in detail in
Zhu et al. (2017). The generator uses ReLU activation functions, instance normalization,
and reflection padding. The discriminator uses leaky ReLU activations with slope 0.2 instead
and instance normalization. We have changed the number of residual layers in the generator
network from 6 to 7.
Besides the cycle-consistency constraint in Eq. 1, another regularization term is added to
the generator loss, in order to enforce an identity mapping with,
Lident(G, F) =Ex∼px(x)[||G(x)−x||1] (2)
+Ey∼py(y)[||F(y)−y||1].
Combining the two regularization terms, the full generator loss then reads
LGenerator =Ex∼px(x)[(DX(G(x))−1)2]
+Ey∼py(y)[(DY(F(y))−1)2] (3)
+λLcycle(G, F) +˜λLident(G, F),
where, DXandDYare the two discriminator networks, and λand ˜λare two hyperpa-
rameters, set to 10 and 5, respectively. The corresponding loss term for the discriminator

We use the ADAM (Kingma and Ba, 2015) optimizer with a learning rate of 2 e−4and
alternatively update the networks. We train the network for 350 epochs and a batch size of
1 (following (Zhu et al., 2017)), saving model checkpoints every other epoch.
C Global error statistics
We evaluate the post-processing methods to improve the mean error bias of the ESM, i.e.,
with
ME(ˆy, y) =1
TTX
t=1ˆyt−1
TTX
t=1yt, (6)
where ˆ ytandytare the modelled and ground truth precipitation values for a single grid
cell at time t. The ME metric can be applied to the unpaired time series since it only
compares long-term averages. The resulting pixel-wise ME bias is summarized in Tab. 1 as
globally averaged absolute mean errors. The constrained GAN can significantly reduce the
ESM bias for annual and seasonal time series. Removing the constraint improves the GAN
performance, achieving result close to the ISIMIP3BASD baseline. The combination of the
two methods outperforms each individual method.
D Fractal dimensions of precipitation fields
Quantifying how realistic generated spatial precipitation fields are is challenging (Ravuri
et al., 2021), especially given their unpaired nature in the climate modelling context of
this study. Typical scores from image generation, such as the Fr´ echet inception distance
(FID) (Salimans et al., 2016; Heusel et al., 2017), cannot straightforwardly be applied to
geospatial data. Here, we use the fractal dimension of binary precipitation fields to measure

the characteristic small-scale variability of the fields. The global precipitation fields are first
converted into binary data using a quantile threshold. The fractal dimension Dfractal is then
computed using the box-counting method (Lovejoy et al., 1987; Meisel et al., 1992), i.e., by
counting the number of squares Nof side length sthat cover the boundary separating the
pattern,
Dfractal =log(Nsquares )
log(1/s). (7)
The results are shown in Fig. A2 for different quantile thresholds. We find that the GANs
accurately capture the fractal dimension across all quantiles, strongly outperforming the
ISIMIP3BASD baseline.

dimension of the W5E5v2 ground truth over all quantile thresholds, clearly outperform-
ing the ISIMIP3BASD baseline. A higher fractal dimension corresponds to more “wiggly”
boundaries of the binary precipitation fields. The mean absolute error w.r.t. the ground
truth W5E5 is shown in the legend.
E Climate non-stationarity
To investigate the ability of the generator network to generalize to new transient climate
states not seen during the training on historical observations, we use the SSP5-8.5 emission
scenario from 2015 to 2100 for the GFDL-ESM4 model. This scenario is one of the most
extreme ones typically considered for future projections.

As seen in Fig. A3, the ESM projects a significant increase in global mean precipitation in
the scenario for this century. This can be expected due to increased water saturation vapour
pressure with higher temperatures (Berg et al., 2013; Guerreiro et al., 2018). By design, the
constraint lets the generator follow the global mean of the ESM. Without the constraint,
on the other hand, the generator is not able to accurately capture the future trend in global
mean precipitation (see Fig. A3a).
On a more regional level in the tropics (from 23◦S to 23◦N), the constrained generator
has the freedom to correct the ESM simulations (see Fig. A3b). As shown in Fig. 1a,
the CycleGAN reduces the mean rainfall in the tropics where the ESM overestimates the
double-ITCZ rainband. The unconstrained network - contrary to the GFDL-ESM4 model -
projects a physically implausible scenario of decreasing precipitation in the tropics.
