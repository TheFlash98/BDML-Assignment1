ABSTRACT
Early detection and management of grapevine diseases are important in pursu-
ing sustainable viticulture. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging
the TabPFN model to forecast blockwise grapevine diseases using climate vari-
ables from multi-sensor remote sensing imagery. By integrating advanced ma-
chine learning techniques with detailed environmental data, our approach sig-
nificantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of disease prediction in vine-
yards. The TabPFN model’s experimental evaluations showcase comparable per-
formance to traditional gradient-boosted decision trees, such as XGBoost, Cat-
Boost, and LightGBM. The model’s capability to process complex data and pro-
vide per-pixel disease-affecting probabilities enables precise, targeted interven-
tions, contributing to more sustainable disease management practices. Our find-
ings underscore the transformative potential of combining Transformer models
with remote sensing data in precision agriculture, offering a scalable solution for
improving crop health and productivity while reducing environmental impact.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Remote sensing technology, with its integration of multisensor image analysis and climate feature
assessment, has become a cornerstone of precision agriculture, particularly in viticulture, where
it offers unparalleled advantages in the early detection of diseases. By leveraging multispectral
Ferro et al. (2023), thermal imaging technologies Fevgas et al. (2023), and climate data, researchers
can monitor the subtle spectral and thermal changes in grapevine foliage-early indicators of phy-
topathological stress. These changes, indicative of disease onset, occur before symptoms are vis-
ibly detectable, providing a critical window for early intervention. Multisensor imagery captures
the vineyard’s detailed spectral profile through various wavelength bands and incorporates climate
variables, enriching the analysis with environmental context. This comprehensive approach, when
further analyzed with indices such as NDVI and NDWI Zhang et al. (2019), transforms complex
datasets into interpretable metrics closely linked to the vines’ health and vitality.
Current disease detection methods in viticulture primarily rely on a combination of manual inspec-
tions, laboratory analysis, and remote sensing technologies. Researchers focus on utilizing high
spatial or spectral resolution images Ferro et al. (2023); Kanaley et al. (2023) to identify vineyard
diseases, with a particular emphasis on detecting individual diseases and analyzing information at
the pixel level Kerkech et al. (2020).
This study explores the benefits of utilizing multi-sensor and multi-scale remote sensing features
to predict grapevine diseases at the block level. We highlight the significant advancements made
possible by these technologies in promoting vineyard health and productivity. A particular challenge
in this field has been the lack of extensive in-situ examples for disease forecasting. The introduction
of the TabPFN method Hollmann et al. (2023) marks a substantial improvement in addressing small-
scale tabular classification challenges. By integrating the TabPFN model with a block-wise disease
database prepared by multi-sensor imagery, we aim to surpass the limitations of current disease
detection methods, setting a new standard for accuracy in vineyard disease management.

2 M ETHODOLOGY
Figure 1: Flowchart of the proposed disease forecasting framework. The TabPFN method Hollmann
et al. (2023); Picard & Ahmed (2024) is used as an example. The TabPFN learns to approximate
the PPD of a given prior in the offline stage to yield predictions on a new dataset in a single forward
pass in the online stage.
This workflow (Fig.1) illustrates our method progression from initial data preparation to the eventual
unknown data classification. The TabPFN, a Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017) based model which
contains 12 layers, is designed for classification tasks on small tabular datasets and trained offline. It
learns to approximate the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) of Bayesian inference on synthetic
datasets, which are drawn from a specified prior. In the Bayesian framework for supervised learning,
the prior defines a space of hypotheses on the relationship of a set of inputs xto the output labels y.
The TabPFN is trained once and can make predictions in less than a second without hyperparameter
tuning. It accepts training and test samples as input and produces predictions in a single forward
pass, making it competitive with state-of-the-art methods while being significantly faster.
Specifically, given a set of training samples Dtrain :={(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)}, the PPD for a test
instance xtestis denoted by p(ytest|xtest, Dtrain). This PPD is calculated by integrating over the
hypothesis space Φ, weighting each hypothesis ϕ∈Φby its prior probability p(ϕ)and the likelihood
p(D|ϕ)of the data Dgiven ϕ: M¨uller et al. (2021):
p(y|x, D)∝Z
Φp(y|x, ϕ)p(D|ϕ)p(ϕ)dϕ (1)
During inference, the trained model is applied to unseen real-world datasets. For a novel dataset
with training samples Dtrain and test features xtest, feeding <Dtrain, xtest>as an input to the
model yields the PPD qθ(y|xtest, Dtrain)in a single forward-pass Hollmann et al. (2023). The PPD
class probabilities are then used to make predictions for the real-world task. To generate synthetic
classification labels for imbalanced multi-class datasets, scalar labels ˆyare transformed into discrete
class labels yby dividing the ˆyvalues into intervals that correspond to class boundaries based on
class labels.
3 E XPERIMENTS
3.1 D ATASET
We compared the proposed method with other approaches using a database of diseases measured
during two seasons in 76 vineyards in Australia, which contain 627 blocks. There were around
nine different kinds of diseases (Fig.5), such as Aspergillus, Bitter Rot, Botrytis, Downy Mildew,
Penicillium, Powdery Mildew, Ripe Rot, Sooty Mould, Sour Rot. The disease data are measured at
the block level. With reference to microbial biogeography for grapevine (Fig. 4), we prepared the
following climate-related features with different remote sensing data Zhao & Efremova (2023):
2Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
• Spectral features and different vegetation indices are provided by Sentinel-2, which were
acquired near the sample time
• Climate features provided by ECMWF and MODIS contains macroclimate and microcli-
mate features. Part of them only captures information from the season start time to the
disease measuring time.
• Soil attributes like Soil type, soil nutrients, soil carbon, pH, bulk density, available water
capacity, etc.
• Terrain attributes like DEM, slope, aspect, etc.
• Block attributes like variety, row direction, geolocation, etc.
The resulting tabular format dataset comprises 1335 samples with around 450 features each.
3.2 E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The data were divided into train (76%) and test (24%) datasets. The total training data is limited
by the TabPFN method Hollmann et al. (2023). Since many diseases happened simultaneously, we
transferred the target to binary values. The number of disease-affecting blocks is much less than
that of healthy blocks. We’ll split the method comparison into two groups, with or without balanced
or weighted targets. The top 25 features are selected with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
values based on the tree-based models.
TabPFN streamlines input preprocessing by implementing feature-wise standardization, heuristic
log-scaling for outliers, and PowerTransform across all attributes for ensemble members. These
steps are vital for aligning real-world data with synthetic training datasets. The tree-based model
preparation is referenced McElfresh et al. (2023). We also prepared two popular deep learning
methods, Transformer and MLP, for comparison.

As shown in Tab.1, the PFNClassifier, when configured with 32 ensembles, shows a competitive
accuracy on the imbalanced dataset, with a slight variation in balanced accuracy and F1-score, illus-
trating the potential of ensemble methods in enhancing prediction reliability. Despite having many
trainable parameters, the MLP and Transformer models lag behind the aforementioned algorithms
in performance across all metrics.
Among the algorithms evaluated, the LGBMClassifier with default parameters on the imbalanced
dataset achieved the highest accuracy, indicating its robustness in handling imbalanced data without
the need for balancing techniques. This is closely followed by the performances of the CatBoost-
Classifier and the XGBClassifier, both also evaluated under default settings. Notably, the CatBoost-
Classifier exhibited superior performance on the balanced dataset, achieving the highest balanced
accuracy and F1-score, underscoring its effectiveness in leveraging the balanced dataset to improve
predictive performance.

In the imbalanced dataset scenario, the TabPFNClassifier achieves an AUC of 0.85 (Fig.2), show-
casing its robustness in dealing with class imbalance. The MLP, however, only attains an AUC of
0.78, indicating potential challenges in handling imbalanced class distributions. For the balanced
dataset, the CatBoostClassifier demonstrates superior performance with the highest AUC of 0.87,
suggesting an exceptional capability to distinguish between classes. Conversely, the Transformer
model shows the least effective performance with an AUC of 0.74, implying room for improvement
in its classification power.
These findings suggest advanced models like MLPs and Transformers have shown remarkable suc-
cess in various domains. However, their application to imbalanced disease datasets without task-
specific tuning might not yield optimal results. In contrast, PFNClassifiers demonstrate a superior
ability to handle imbalanced data effectively, even without explicit balancing techniques. It can
provide comparable results as gradient-boosted decision trees.

Figure 3: Disease probability maps for 10 blocks in early 2021 in Australia. The probability of
disease is displayed as a visual heat map (green = low probability, yellow = high probability).
Given the PFNClassifier’s capability to output both a binary target and probability estimates, it is
suitably applied to detailed, pixel-wise disease forecasting as depicted in Figure 3. This figure
presents a collection of pixel-wise classification heatmaps, each corresponding to a specific vine-
yard block, to visually represent the predicted distribution of disease risk. The gradations of color
within these heatmaps delineate the likelihood of disease occurrence, offering a refined, localized
risk assessment at the level of individual vineyard blocks.

performance to traditional methods like gradient-boosted decision trees. This approach enhances
blockwise disease forecasting in viticulture by incorporating environmental data and advanced ma-
chine learning, offering a nuanced understanding of disease dynamics. Future work will pay more
attention to using phenology and temporal climate features.
