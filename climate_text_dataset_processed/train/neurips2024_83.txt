Abstract
In regions where climate data is scarce, adapting to climate change becomes a 1
significant challenge due to the lack of reliable information. This project addresses 2
this issue by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to generate comprehen- 3
sive climate datasets in a data-scarce region of Choke Mountain Watersheds in 4
Ethiopia. The primary objectives are to fill gaps in existing in-situ precipitation 5
and temperature observations and to create data for areas that are currently unmon- 6
itored. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, we will improve the 7
accuracy and reliability of climate data, and fill gaps in current datasets to ensure 8
completeness. Ensuring availability of a continuous dataset is crucial for informed 9
decision-making in climate change adaptation. 10
1 Introduction 11
Data scarcity significantly hampers research and informed decision-making, particularly in the 12
context of climate change adaptation. In regions with low gauge density, the sparse distribution 13
of weather stations leads to large gaps in spatial data coverage, making it difficult to accurately 14
monitor and predict climate patterns. Poor data quality further exacerbates this issue, as unreliable 15
or inconsistent measurements can skew analyses and lead to incorrect conclusions. Additionally, 16
the inaccessibility of data, whether due to lack of infrastructure, economy, topographic barrier or 17
proprietary restrictions, limits the ability of researchers and policymakers to obtain comprehensive 18
datasets needed for robust climate modeling and risk assessment. Consequently, poor-quality and 19
data inaccessibility undermines efforts to develop effective adaptation strategies, leaving communities 20
more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Addressing these data challenges is crucial for 21
enhancing the resilience of data-scarce regions. This issue is more challenging in the Choke Mountain 22
Watersheds (CMW), Ethiopia. The CMW located in the northwestern part of Ethiopia are vital 23
ecosystems that significantly contribute to the regional hydrology, agriculture, and biodiversity. This 24
mountainous area, characterized by diverse microclimates, significantly influences the climate and 25
the hydrological process of major river systems [ 1]. It is home to numerous major tributaries of 26
the transboundary Blue Nile River. It also inhabits over 150,000 people who rely heavily on mixed 27
farming and livestock for their livelihoods. The diverse ecosystems provide essential resources, 28
making accurate climate data crucial for effective climate change adaptation. Despite its importance, 29
there is a lack of high-resolution, continuous, and accurate climate data for research and development 30
activities. Currently there are about 35 weather stations installed in and around the CMW. The stations 31
are monitored by the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute (https://www.ethiomet.gov.et/). However, this 32

data collection are often limited by the region’s rugged terrain and limited accessibility. 34
To address this gap, this project proposes the development of a comprehensive climate dataset for 35
the CMW region by integrating artificial intelligence (machine learning) techniques with remote 36
sensing and reanalysis data. Some of the promising satellite-based and reanalysis products include 37
the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS; [ 2]), Integrated Multi- 38
satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG; [ 3]) and the Fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis 39
(ERA5; [ 4]). The use of satellite data as input features significantly improves the temperature data 40
imputation or prediction accuracy of Random Forest and XGBoost machine learning algorithms [ 5]. 41
By combining these satellite-based datasets with ground-based observations, this project aims to 42
enhance data accuracy and improve the spatial and temporal coverage of data, thus facilitating 43
more precise modeling, forecasting, and decision-making for environmental management and policy 44
development in the region. In this work, we propose to address data-gaps of in-situ measurement 45
using integrated Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) techniques, new data generation 46
for ungauged locations using Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and forecasting. The 47
integration of these technologies will provide a comprehensive framework for real-time monitoring, 48
predictive analysis of climate change effects, and decision support in various sectors. 49
2 Methods 50
2.1 Integrated Random Forest Regression and k-Nearest Neighbor model development 51
We propose using an integrated Random Forest (RF) regression and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) 52
approach for imputing missing in-situ data of rainfall and temperature. Studies have shown that 53
integrated RF and k-NN are effective methods for imputing missing in-situ data [ 6]. RF regression 54
leverages the ensemble learning technique of random forests to predict missing values by averaging 55
the predictions of multiple decision trees, thus enhancing accuracy and robustness [ 7,8]. On the 56
other hand, k-NN imputes missing values by identifying the k-nearest data points in the feature 57
space and averaging their values, making it particularly useful for datasets with complex, non-linear 58
relationships. Imputations based on k-NN is simple and easy to implement make it popular across 59
various domains [ 9]. The imputation performance of the integrated RF and k-NN methods will be 60
studied and compared with that of individual RF and k-NN performances. This method deploys 61
multiple imputation techniques where datasets of several stations with variable lengths of dataset 62
record periods, will be used simultaneously during the imputation process. The model performance 63
will be evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient 64
of determination (R2). 65
2.2 Integrated k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 66
Networks model development 67
We propose using an integrated k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 68
approach for estimating rainfall and temperature data in unmonitored locations. k-NN identifies 69
the k-nearest data points based on spatial and temporal similarities based on Euclidean distance, 70
providing a robust initial estimate. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, excels at capturing 71
long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in sequential data [ 10]. The model firstly used k-NN 72
algorithm to select the time and space-related meteorological stations, then the daily rainfall and 73
temperature dataset and features sequences of these stations were constructed, and followed by 74
training and testing processes in the LSTM model as it was used in other fields of studies [ 11,12]. 75
By combining these methods, the approach leverages k-NN’s ability to handle spatial variability and 76
LSTM’s strength in modeling temporal dynamics, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions 77
for unmonitored locations. In addition to the above methods, we will also develop baseline models 78
such as the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), 79
and Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to compare the results of the individual 80
and integrated k-NN and LSTM models in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. To train and validate 81

the models, we will split the ground observations into three sets: a training, test and validation set. 82
This approach helps ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting. A few 83
stations will be left for model validation purposes. The proposed workflow is given in figure 1. 84
3 Expected outcome and impact 85
The successful implementation of this project is expected to yield several significant outcomes. 86
Firstly, the development of a high-resolution, continuous, and accurate climate dataset for the Choke 87
Mountain Watersheds will fill critical data gaps, enhancing the understanding of regional climate 88
dynamics. This dataset will be invaluable for researchers and policymakers, providing a reliable 89
foundation for climate modeling, risk assessment, and the formulation of effective climate adaptation 90
strategies. Secondly, the integration of artificial intelligence will demonstrate the potential of advanced 91
technologies in overcoming the limitations of traditional data collection methods. By improving the 92
accuracy and reliability of climate data, this project will set a precedent for similar initiatives in other 93
data-scarce regions, promoting the adoption of AI-driven solutions in environmental monitoring. 94
After completing the data imputation and generation, we plan to host the data and best performing 95
models on our institute’s server so that users can generate data for their desired locations using only 96
coordinates and altitude for their intended time period. The impact of this project extends beyond 97
the immediate region. The insights gained from this project will inform broader efforts to mitigate 98
the impacts of climate change, fostering sustainable development and environmental stewardship in 99
Ethiopia and beyond. 100
4 Pathway to tackle climate change 101
This project will create clear pathways to climate impact by generating high-resolution, accurate 102
climate data for the Choke Mountain Watersheds. By integrating AI methodologies and remote 103
sensing, the project will enhance climate monitoring and predictive capabilities, enabling precise risk 104
assessments (e.g. drought, flood and land slide) and informed decision-making. This improved data 105
will support effective water resource management, agricultural planning, and biodiversity conserva- 106
tion, directly contributing to the resilience of local communities. Additionally, the methodologies 107
developed can be applied to other data-scarce regions, promoting broader adoption of AI-driven 108
climate solutions and fostering global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. 109
