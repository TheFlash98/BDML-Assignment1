Abstract
Europe was hit by several, disastrous heat and drought events in recent summers.
Besides thermodynamic inﬂuences, such hot and dry extremes are driven by certain
atmospheric situations including anticyclonic conditions. Effects of climate change
on atmospheric circulations are complex and many open research questions remain
in this context, e.g., on future trends of anticyclonic conditions. Based on the
combination of a catalog of labeled circulation patterns and spatial atmospheric
variables, we propose a smoothed convolutional neural network classiﬁer for six
types of anticyclonic circulations that are associated with drought and heat. Our
work can help to identify important drivers of hot and dry extremes in climate
simulations, which allows to unveil the impact of climate change on these drivers.
We address various challenges inherent to circulation pattern classiﬁcation that
are also present in other climate patterns, e.g., subjective labels and unambiguous
transition periods.
1 Introduction
In recent summers such as those of 2003, 2010 and 2018, Europe has been subject to particularly
outstanding summer drought and heat events, which caused large economic and societal damage
including heat-related deaths [1, 2]. The frequency and intensity of hot and dry extremes has
recently increased and is projected to further increase due to climate change and rising global mean
temperatures [3, 4].
Drivers of hot and dry extremes There are two key processes leading to drought and heat events:
thermodynamic and dynamic factors. Thermodynamic factors involve, e.g., evaporation and the
feedback between soil moisture and air temperature. Dynamic factors on the other hand describe
the atmospheric drivers of heat and drought, which are mainly anticyclonic conditions and blocking
[3]. While anticyclonic conditions go along with various high-pressure systems, blocking describes
a particular, persistent high-pressure situation that is associated with the displacement of westerly
winds and their accompanying weather systems [3, 5]. These atmospheric drivers of hot and dry
extremes are part of the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the mid-latitudes, which control the
weather and climate over Europe [6, 7]. Changes in the atmospheric circulation are complex with
opposing processes and thus many open research questions remain [5, 8].
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Classiﬁcation of circulation patterns Objectively classifying the circulation patterns that are
associated with hot and dry extremes is an important step towards a better understanding of how
climate change affects the atmospheric drivers of potentially disastrous extreme events. Previous
studies, e.g., [9, 10, 11] have shown that deep learning approaches are powerful tools for the detection
of extreme weather in climate simulations. In this study, we use a subjective catalog of circulation
type classiﬁcations over Europe by Hess & Brezowsky [12, 13]. Our goal is to learn the categorization
of six circulation types with anticyclonic conditions over Europe, which are associated with dry and
hot summer conditions in Central Europe [14]. The classiﬁcation of circulation types comes with
various challenges that need to be addressed with appropriate modeling strategies. Challenges include
noisy labels due to subjective expert choices in ambiguous climate situations [15], an imbalanced
class distribution of labels, undeﬁned transition days between successive circulation patterns, and a
ﬁxed dwell time of a circulation pattern of at least three consecutive days by its deﬁnition [13].
Our contribution In this work we propose a novel modeling procedure to address existing chal-
lenges in classifying anticyclonic circulation patterns. Especially in times of large ensembles of
climate simulations [16] that consist of dozens of model runs and thousands of model years, our study
can help to efﬁciently analyse large climate simulations and be another piece of the puzzle to better
understand changes in the atmospheric drivers of drought and heat.
2 Data
The Hess & Brezowsky catalog contains a subjective categorization of circulation patterns created by
experts manually labelling air pressure patterns over Europe into 29 classes. In this way, daily air
pressure constellations are retrospectively assigned to one of these classes. A circulation pattern is,
by deﬁnition, required to last at least three days. The six circulation patterns associated with heat
and drought are (abbreviations originate from German): Zonal ridge across Central Europe (BM),
Norwegian Sea-Iceland high, anticyclonic (HNA), North-easterly anticyclonic (NEA), Fennoscandian
high, anticyclonic (HFA), Norwegian Sea-Fennoscandian high, anticyclonic (HNFA), and South-
easterly anticyclonic (SEA) [17, 14]. The mean air pressure patterns for the six circulation patterns of
interest are given in Figure 1 for the variables sea level pressure andgeopotential height at 500 hPa
(average values at roughly 5500 meters height). For the analysis of heat and drought, the remaining
23 circulation types are assigned to a residual class. The frequencies of the six anticyclonic patterns
are between 8.5% (BM) and 1.4% (HNFA), whereas the residual class comprises about 80% of the
days.
Figure 1: Mean air pressure patterns of the six anticyclonic circulation types BM, HNA, NEA, HFA,
HNFA, and SEA (columns) averaged over all days in the period between 1900 and 2010. The plots
are shown for the variables (rows) sea level pressure [hPa] and geopotential height at 500 hPa [m].
2Next to the catalog by Hess & Brezowsky, we supplement our data base with the ERA-20C reanalysis
data by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts [18]. The long record ERA-20C
data set contains global spatial information on various climate parameters from 1900 to 2010. In
accordance with the deﬁnition by [13], we use the two atmospheric variables, sea level pressure
and geopotential height at 500 hPa as predictors for circulation patterns. The spatial domain of our
data set is deﬁned over a region covering Europe and the North Atlantic [13] (see Figure 1) with a
spatial resolution of 5 °x 5°resulting in a grid of 16 x 29 pixels. The resulting data set contains daily
information over 111 years, i.e., T = 40541 observations.
3 Methods
Model deﬁnition, training, tuning and evaluation To account for the spatial information and
the speciﬁc characteristics of circulation patterns, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN)
following [19], who propose a network architecture for climate pattern detection problems. Since air
pressure patterns of atmospheric features are comparatively simple, our chosen architecture consists
of only two convolutional layers with larger kernels (5x5-8 and 5x5-16), a dropout layer and two
fully-connected layers as well as individual channels for both climate parameters. The two different
atmospheric variables are included as individual channels in the CNN as in [2, 10]. While there is
reason to believe that accounting for the temporal structure of our data, e.g., through a structured
model [20] or ConvLSTM [21] improves the model, a previous study [22] showed no improvement
in the classiﬁcation of circulation patterns when using a temporal-aware architecture. As explained
in the next paragraph, our approach instead smoothes predicted labels to account for their temporal
nature.
The model is trained using Adam optimization with a batch size of 128 for 35 epochs and early
stopping based on a validation set of size 3650 with patience of 6 epochs. Hyperparameter tuning for
learning rate and dropout rate is performed using Bayesian optimization [23]. We evaluate the model
using overall accuracy and macro F1-score. For class-speciﬁc evaluations, we consider recall and
precision. To obtain performance estimates that are as unbiased as possible, a nested cross-validation
with ten inner and eleven outer folds is used. In order to not leak intra-year information, observations
within the same year are required to belong to the same fold.
Modeling challenges Our approach takes into account several data-speciﬁc characteristics for
circulation pattern data. First, we employ a loss-weighting scheme to account for imbalanced classes
by weighting the classes with their inverse frequencies. Moreover, the assigned categories in the
Hess & Brezowsky catalog can be noisy, in particular for transition days between two subsequent
circulation patterns. This is due to the continuous movement of pressure systems while circulation
types are discrete by deﬁnition and in-between states do not ﬁt in one or the other class. We address
this problem by using label-smoothing [24] for the ﬁrst and last day of each occurrence of a speciﬁc
circulation pattern. Finally, our target variable must adhere to the aforementioned deﬁnition of
a circulation pattern, implying a pattern to last at least three days. A transition-smoothing step
ensures that this three day rule is respected. In this step, the ﬁnal predicted class ~ytat time point
t= 2; :::; T 2, is given by
~yt=8

This guarantees consistency with the required three day rule and systematically replaces isolated
single or two day-type predictions.
34 Results
Taking into account the aforementioned subjectivity of the circulation pattern catalog and the noisy
labels, the overall performance of the proposed model is satisfactory and our proposed smoothing
approaches consistently improve the model across all classes. Our smoothed convolutional neural
network classiﬁer achieves an macro F1-score of 38.4% and an overall accuracy of 59.9% averaged
over the test sets during nested cross-validation. Table 1 shows the corresponding confusion matrix
together with the precision and recall. The best performance in terms of recall is achieved for
the circulation patterns HNA and BM, the lowest performance for NEA. In absolute numbers,
misclassiﬁcations mainly occur for residual class observations. Due to the proposed error weighting
technique, we obtain larger recall than precision values except for the residual class.

Table 2 shows an ablation study of our modeling procedure. Including label- and transition-smoothing
improves the overall accuracy by 4 percentage points and the macro F1-score by 2 percentage points
compared to a model without any smoothing steps. The class speciﬁc F1-scores also considerably
increase for all patterns. A comparison of the networks without label-smoothing and without
transition-smoothing indicates that the label-smoothing step has rather little impact while the proposed
transition-smoothing is the key to our observed performance gains.

5 Conclusion and Outlook
Our results indicate the high potential of deep learning-based methods in classifying the atmospheric
drivers of drought and heat. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our smoothed approach to deal
with typical challenges in circulation type classiﬁcations, e.g., transition-smoothing for historical
4dwell time deﬁnitions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to use air pressure patterns
over Europe to classify circulation patterns associated with drought and heat as given in the Hess &
Brezowsky catalog. While the proposed approach can potentially also be used for other circulation
patterns associated with different kinds of extreme climate events, our goal was to establish a
baseline model for this speciﬁc and highly relevant circulation pattern categorization. Although our
approach relies on a network architecture developed for climate applications [19], there is room for
improvement in modeling the analyzed patterns. As an alternative to the transition-smoothing step,
we will investigate a deep hidden Markov model that accounts for the state dwell times by assuming
a latent process that emulates the data-inherent three day transition rule.
