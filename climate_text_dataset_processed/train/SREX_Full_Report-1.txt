Special Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Extreme weather and climate events, interacting with exposed and vulnerable human and natural systems, can lead to disasters. T his
Special Report explores the challenge of understanding and managing the risks of climate extremes to advance climate change ada ptation.
Weather- and climate-related disasters have social as well as physical dimensions. As a result, changes in the frequency and se verity of
the physical events affect disaster risk, but so do the spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulne rability.
Some types of extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency or magnitude, but populations and assets at risk h ave
also increased, with consequences for disaster risk. Opportunities for managing risks of weather- and climate-related disasters  exist or
can be developed at any scale, local to international. Some strategies for effectively managing risks and adapting to climate c hange
involve adjustments to current activities. Others require transformation or fundamental change. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, in cluding
the physical science of climate; impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; and mitigation of climate change. The IPCC was establi shed by the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with acomprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge of climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomicimpacts.Managing the Risks of Extreme Events

(SREX) has been jointly coordinated by Working Groups I (WGI) and II (WGII) of the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC). The report focuses on the relationship between climate change and extreme weather andclimate events, the impacts of such events, and the strategies to manage the associated risks.
The IPCC was jointly established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), in particular to assess in a comprehensive, objective, and transparent manner all therelevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information to contribute in understanding the scientific basis of riskof human-induced climate change, the potential impacts, and the adaptation and mitigation options. Beginning in1990, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, andother key documents which have since become the standard references for policymakers and scientists.
This Special Report, in particular, contributes to frame the challenge of dealing with extreme weather and climate
events as an issue in decisionmaking under uncertainty, analyzing response in the context of risk management. Thereport consists of nine chapters, covering risk management; observed and projected changes in extreme weather andclimate events; exposure and vulnerability to as well as losses resulting from such events; adaptation options from thelocal to the international scale; the role of sustainable development in modulating risks; and insights from specificcase studies.
Success in developing this report depended foremost on the knowledge, integrity, enthusiasm, and collaboration of
hundreds of experts worldwide, representing a very wide range of disciplines. We would like to express our gratitudeto all the Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors, Contributing Authors, Review Editors, and Expert and GovernmentReviewers who devoted considerable expertise, time, and effort to produce this report. We are extremely grateful fortheir commitment to the IPCC process and we would also like to thank the staff of the WGI and WGII TechnicalSupport Units and the IPCC Secretariat, for their unrestricted commitment to the development of such an ambitiousand highly significant IPCC Special Report.
We are also very grateful to the governments which supported their scientists’ participation in this task, as well as to
all those that contributed to the IPCC Trust Fund, thereby facilitating the essential participation of experts from thedeveloping world. We would also like to express our appreciation, in particular, to the governments of Australia,Panama, Switzerland, and Vietnam for hosting the drafting sessions in their respective countries, as well as to thegovernment of Uganda for hosting in Kampala the First Joint Session of Working Groups I and II which approved thereport. Our thanks are also due to the governments of Switzerland and the United States of America for funding theTechnical Support Units for WGI and WGII, respectively. We also wish to acknowledge the collaboration of the
government of Norway – which also provided critical support for meetings and outreach – and the United Nations
International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), in the preparation of the original report proposal.
We would especially wish to thank the IPCC Chairman, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, for his direction and guidance of the
IPCC process, as well as the Co-Chairs of Working Groups II and I, Professors Vicente Barros, Christopher Field, Qin
Dahe, and Thomas Stocker, for their leadership throughout the development of this Special Report.Foreword

This volume, Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation, is a Special
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report is a collaborative effort of Working Group I(WGI) and Working Group II (WGII). The IPCC leadership team for this report also has responsibility for the IPCC FifthAssessment Report (AR5), scheduled for completion in 2013 and 2014.
The Special Report brings together scientific communities with expertise in three very different aspects of managing
risks of extreme weather and climate events. For this report, specialists in disaster recovery, disaster risk management,and disaster risk reduction, a community mostly new to the IPCC, joined forces with experts in the areas of the physicalscience basis of climate change (WGI) and climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability (WGII). Over thecourse of the two-plus years invested in assessing information and writing the report, scientists from these threecommunities forged shared goals and products.
Extreme weather and climate events have figured prominently in past IPCC assessments. Extremes can contribute to
disasters, but disaster risk is influenced by more than just the physical hazards. Disaster risk emerges from the interactionof weather or climate events, the physical contributors to disaster risk, with exposure and vulnerability, the contributorsto risk from the human side. The combination of severe consequences, rarity, and human as well as physical determinantsmakes disasters difficult to study. Only over the last few years has the science of these events, their impacts, andoptions for dealing with them become mature enough to support a comprehensive assessment. This report provides acareful assessment of scientific, technical, and socioeconomic knowledge as of May 2011, the cut-off date for literatureincluded.
The Special Report introduced some important innovations to the IPCC. One was the integration, in a single Special
Report, of skills and perspectives across the disciplines covered by WGI, WGII, and the disaster risk management com-munity. A second important innovation was the report’s emphasis on adaptation and disaster risk management. Athird innovation was a plan for an ambitious outreach effort. Underlying these innovations and all aspects of thereport is a strong commitment to assessing science in a way that is relevant to policy but not policy prescriptive.
The Process
The Special Report represents the combined efforts of hundreds of leading experts. The Government of Norway andthe United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction submitted a proposal for the report to the IPCC inSeptember 2008. This was followed by a scoping meeting to develop a candidate outline in March 2009. Followingapproval of the outline in April 2009, governments and observer organizations nominated experts for the author team.
The team approved by the WGI and WGII Bureaux consisted of 87 Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors, plus
19 Review Editors. In addition, 140 Contributing Authors submitted draft text and information to the author teams. Thedrafts of the report were circulated twice for formal review, first to experts and second to both experts and governments,resulting in 18,784 review comments. Author teams responded to every comment and, where scientifically appropriate,modified drafts in response to comments, with Review Editors monitoring the process. The revised report was presentedfor consideration at the First Joint Session of WGI and WGII, from 14 to 17 November 2011. At the joint session,
delegates from over 100 countries evaluated and approved, by consensus, the Summary for Policymakers on a
line-by-line basis and accepted the full report.
Structure of the Special Report
This report contains a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) plus nine chapters. References in the SPM point to the
supporting sections of the technical chapters that provide a traceable account of every major finding. The first two
chapters set the stage for the report. Chapter 1 frames the issue of extreme weather and climate events as a challengePrefacexin understanding and managing risk. It characterizes risk as emerging from the overlap of a triggering physical event
with exposure of people and assets and their vulnerability. Chapter 2 explores the determinants of exposure andvulnerability in detail, concluding that every disaster has social as well as physical dimensions. Chapter 3, the majorcontribution of WGI, is an assessment of the scientific literature on observed and projected changes in extreme weatherand climate events, and their attribution to causes where possible. Chapter 4 assesses observed and projectedimpacts, considering patterns by sector as well as region. Chapters 5 through 7 assess experience and theory inadaptation to extremes and disasters, focusing on issues and opportunities at the local scale (Chapter 5), the nationalscale (Chapter 6), and the international scale (Chapter 7). Chapter 8 assesses the interactions among sustainabledevelopment, vulnerability reduction, and disaster risk, considering both opportunities and constraints, as well as thekinds of transformations relevant to overcoming the constraints. Chapter 9 develops a series of case studies thatillustrate the role of real life complexity but also document examples of important progress in managing risk.

Context
This Summary for Policymakers presents key findings from the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme
Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). The SREX approaches the topic by assessing thescientific literature on issues that range from the relationship between climate change and extreme weather andclimate events (‘climate extremes’) to the implications of these events for society and sustainable development. Theassessment concerns the interaction of climatic, environmental, and human factors that can lead to impacts anddisasters, options for managing the risks posed by impacts and disasters, and the important role that non-climaticfactors play in determining impacts. Box SPM.1 defines concepts central to the SREX.
The character and severity of impacts from climate extremes depend not only on the extremes themselves but also on
exposure and vulnerability. In this report, adverse impacts are considered disasters when they produce widespreaddamage and cause severe alterations in the normal functioning of communities or societies. Climate extremes,exposure, and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of factors, including anthropogenic climate change, naturalclimate variability, and socioeconomic development (Figure SPM.1). Disaster risk management and adaptation toclimate change focus on reducing exposure and vulnerability and increasing resilience to the potential adverse impactsof climate extremes, even though risks cannot fully be eliminated (Figure SPM.2). Although mitigation of climatechange is not the focus of this report, adaptation and mitigation can complement each other and together cansignificantly reduce the risks of climate change. [SYR AR4, 5.3]
Figure SPM.1 | Illustration of the core concepts of SREX. The report assesses how exposure and vulnerability to weather and climate events det ermine impacts and the likelihood
of disasters (disaster risk). It evaluates the influence of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on cli mate extremes and other weather and climate events
that can contribute to disasters, as well as the exposure and vulnerability of human society and natural ecosystems. It also co nsiders the role of development in trends in exposure
and vulnerability, implications for disaster risk, and interactions between disasters and development. The report examines how disaster risk management and adaptation to climate
change can reduce exposure and vulnerability to weather and climate events and thus reduce disaster risk, as well as increase r esilience to the risks that cannot be eliminated.
Other important processes are largely outside the scope of this report, including the influence of development on greenhouse ga s emissions and anthropogenic climate change,
and the potential for mitigation of anthropogenic climate change. [1.1.2, Figure 1-1]5Summary for Policymakers
Box SPM.1 | Definitions Central to SREX
Core concepts defined in the SREX glossary1and used throughout the report include: 
Climate Change: A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean
and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due
to natural internal processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere  or in
land use.2
Climate Extreme (extreme weather or climate event): The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (or below)
a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed values of the variable. For simplicity, both extreme weather
events and extreme climate events are referred to collectively as ‘climate extremes.’ The full definition is provided in Sectio n 3.1.2.
Exposure: The presence of people; livelihoods; environmental services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social, or cultural
assets in places that could be adversely affected.
Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected.
Disaster: Severe alterations in the normal functioning of a community or a society due to hazardous physical events interacting with
vulnerable social conditions, leading to widespread adverse human, material, economic, or environmental effects that require im mediate
emergency response to satisfy critical human needs and that may require external support for recovery.
Disaster Risk: The likelihood over a specified time period of severe alterations in the normal functioning of a community or a society
due to hazardous physical events interacting with vulnerable social conditions, leading to widespread adverse human, material,economic, or environmental effects that require immediate emergency response to satisfy critical human needs and that may requi re
external support for recovery.
Disaster Risk Management: Processes for designing, implementing, and evaluating strategies, policies, and measures to improve the
understanding of disaster risk, foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and promote continuous improvement in disaster pre paredness,
response, and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of increasing human security, well-being, quality of life, resilien ce, and
sustainable development.
Adaptation: In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or
exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human interv ention may
facilitate adjustment to expected climate.
Resilience: The ability of a system and its component parts to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of a
hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner, including through ensuring the preservation, restoration, or improvement of i ts
essential basic structures and functions.
Transformation: The altering of fundamental attributes of a system (including value systems; regulatory, legislative, or bureaucratic
regimes; financial institutions; and technological or biological systems).
____________
1Reflecting the diversity of the communities involved in this assessment and progress in science, several of the definitions use d in this Special Report differ in breadth or
focus from those used in the Fourth Assessment Report and other IPCC reports.
2This definition differs from that in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where climate change i s defined as: “a change of climate
which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time period s.” The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric
composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.6Summary for Policymakers
This report integrates perspectives from several historically distinct research communities studying climate science,
climate impacts, adaptation to climate change, and disaster risk management. Each community brings differentviewpoints, vocabularies, approaches, and goals, and all provide important insights into the status of the knowledgebase and its gaps. Many of the key assessment findings come from the interfaces among these communities. These
interfaces are also illustrated in Table SPM.1. To accurately convey the degree of certainty in key findings, the report
relies on the consistent use of calibrated uncertainty language, introduced in Box SPM.2. The basis for substantive
paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections specified in square brackets.
Exposure and vulnerability are key determinants of disaster risk and of impacts when risk is realized.
[1.1.2, 1.2.3, 1.3, 2.2.1, 2.3, 2.5] For example, a tropical cyclone can have very different impacts depending on whereand when it makes landfall. [2.5.1, 3.1, 4.4.6] Similarly, a heat wave can have very different impacts on different
populations depending on their vulnerability. [Box 4-4, 9.2.1] Extreme impacts on human, ecological, or physical
systems can result from individual extreme weather or climate events. Extreme impacts can also result from non-
extreme events where exposure and vulnerability are high [2.2.1, 2.3, 2.5] or from a compounding of events or their
impacts. [1.1.2, 1.2.3, 3.1.3] For example, drought, coupled with extreme heat and low humidity, can increase the riskof wildfire. [Box 4-1, 9.2.2] 
Extreme and non-extreme weather or climate events affect vulnerability to future extreme events by modifying
resilience, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity. [2.4.3] In particular, the cumulative effects of disasters at local
Figure SPM.2 | Adaptation and disaster risk management approaches for reducing and managing disaster risk in a changing climate. This report a ssesses a wide range of
complementary adaptation and disaster risk management approaches that can reduce the risks of climate extremes and disasters an d increase resilience to remaining risks as they
change over time. These approaches can be overlapping and can be pursued simultaneously. [6.5, Figure 6-3, 8.6]7B.or sub-national levels can substantially affect
livelihood options and resources and the capacityof societies and communities to prepare for andrespond to future disasters. [2.2, 2.7] 
A changing climate leads to changes in the
frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration,and timing of extreme weather and climateevents, and can result in unprecedentedextreme weather and climate events. Changes
in extremes can be linked to changes in the mean,variance, or shape of probability distributions, or allof these (Figure SPM.3). Some climate extremes (e.g.,droughts) may be the result of an accumulation ofweather or climate events that are not extremewhen considered independently. Many extremeweather and climate events continue to be theresult of natural climate variability. Natural variabilitywill be an important factor in shaping futureextremes in addition to the effect of anthropogenicchanges in climate. [3.1]
Observations of
Exposure, Vulnerability,Climate Extremes,Impacts, and DisasterLosses
The impacts of climate extremes and the potential
for disasters result from the climate extremesthemselves and from the exposure and vulnerabilityof human and natural systems. Observed changesin climate extremes reflect the influence of
anthropogenic climate change in addition to naturalclimate variability, with changes in exposure andvulnerability influenced by both climatic and non-
climatic factors.
Exposure and Vulnerability
Exposure and vulnerability are dynamic, varying across temporal and spatial scales, and depend on
economic, social, geographic, demographic, cultural, institutional, governance, and environmental factors
(high confidence ). [2.2, 2.3, 2.5] Individuals and communities are differentially exposed and vulnerable based on
inequalities expressed through levels of wealth and education, disability, and health status, as well as gender, age,
class, and other social and cultural characteristics. [2.5]
Settlement patterns, urbanization, and changes in socioeconomic conditions have all influenced observed
trends in exposure and vulnerability to climate extremes ( high confidence ). [4.2, 4.3.5] For example, coastalSummary for Policymakers

settlements, including in small islands and megadeltas, and mountain settlements are exposed and vulnerable to
climate extremes in both developed and developing countries, but with differences among regions and countries.[4.3.5, 4.4.3, 4.4.6, 4.4.9, 4.4.10] Rapid urbanization and the growth of megacities, especially in developing countries,have led to the emergence of highly vulnerable urban communities, particularly through informal settlements andinadequate land management ( high agreement, robust evidence ). [5.5.1] See also Case Studies 9.2.8 and 9.2.9.
Vulnerable populations also include refugees, internally displaced people, and those living in marginal areas. [4.2, 4.3.5] 
Climate Extremes and Impacts
There is evidence from observations gathered since 1950 of change in some extremes. Confidence inobserved changes in extremes depends on the quality and quantity of data and the availability of studiesanalyzing these data, which vary across regions and for different extremes. Assigning ‘low confidence’ inobserved changes in a specific extreme on regional or global scales neither implies nor excludes thepossibility of changes in this extreme. Extreme events are rare, which means there are few data available to make
assessments regarding changes in their frequency or intensity. The more rare the event the more difficult it is to identifylong-term changes. Global-scale trends in a specific extreme may be either more reliable (e.g., for temperatureextremes) or less reliable (e.g., for droughts) than some regional-scale trends, depending on the geographical uniformityof the trends in the specific extreme. The following paragraphs provide further details for specific climate extremesfrom observations since 1950. [3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.2.1]
It is very likely that there has been an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights,
3and an overall increase
in the number of warm days and nights,3at the global scale, that is, for most land areas with sufficient data. It is likely
that these changes have also occurred at the continental scale in North America, Europe, and Australia. There is medium
confidence in a warming trend in daily temperature extremes in much of Asia. Confidence in observed trends in daily
temperature extremes in Africa and South America generally varies from lowto medium depending on the region. In
many (but not all) regions over the globe with sufficient data, there is medium confidence that the length or number
of warm spells or heat waves3has increased. [3.3.1, Table 3-2]
There have been statistically significant trends in the number of heavy precipitation events in some regions. It is likely
that more of these regions have experienced increases than decreases, although there are strong regional andsubregional variations in these trends. [3.3.2]
There is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e.,
intensity, frequency, duration), after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. It is likely that there has been
a poleward shift in the main Northern and Southern Hemisphere extratropical storm tracks. There is low confidence in
observed trends in small spatial-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail because of data inhomogeneities and
inadequacies in monitoring systems. [3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5]
There is medium confidence that some regions of the world have experienced more intense and longer droughts, in
particular in southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions droughts have become less frequent, less intense,
or shorter, for example, in central North America and northwestern Australia. [3.5.1]
There is limited to medium evidence available to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and
frequency of floods at regional scales because the available instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are
limited in space and time, and because of confounding effects of changes in land use and engineering. Furthermore,
there is low agreement in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of
these changes. [3.5.2]
____________
3See SREX Glossary for definition of these terms: cold days / cold nights, warm days / warm nights, and warm spell – heat wave.9Summary for Policymakers
It is likely that there has been an increase in extreme coastal high water related to increases in mean sea level.
[3.5.3]
There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including
increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. It is likely that anthropogenic influences have led
to warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale. There is medium confidence
that anthropogenic influences have contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation at the global scale. It islikely that there has been an anthropogenic influence on increasing extreme coastal high water due to an increase in
mean sea level. The uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, the incomplete understanding of the physicalmechanisms linking tropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree of tropical cyclone variability provide
only low confidence for the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic
influences. Attribution of single extreme events to anthropogenic climate change is challenging. [3.2.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2,3.4.4, 3.5.3, Table 3-1]
Disaster Losses
Economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters have increased, but with large spatial andinterannual variability ( high confidence , based on high agreement , medium evidence ).Global weather- and
climate-related disaster losses reported over the last few decades reflect mainly monetized direct damages to assets,and are unequally distributed. Estimates of annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few US$ billion to above200 billion (in 2010 dollars), with the highest value for 2005 (the year of Hurricane Katrina). Loss estimates are lower-bound estimates because many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, aredifficult to value and monetize, and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses. Impacts on the informal orundocumented economy as well as indirect economic effects can be very important in some areas and sectors, but aregenerally not counted in reported estimates of losses. [4.5.1, 4.5.3, 4.5.4]
Economic, including insured, disaster losses associated with weather, climate, and geophysical events
4are
higher in developed countries. Fatality rates and economic losses expressed as a proportion of grossdomestic product (GDP) are higher in developing countries ( high confidence ). During the period from 1970 to
2008, over 95% of deaths from natural disasters occurred in developing countries. Middle-income countries with rapidlyexpanding asset bases have borne the largest burden. During the period from 2001 to 2006, losses amounted to about1% of GDP for middle-income countries, while this ratio has been about 0.3% of GDP for low-income countries andless than 0.1% of GDP for high-income countries, based on limited evidence . In small exposed countries, particularly
small island developing states, losses expressed as a percentage of GDP have been particularly high, exceeding 1% inmany cases and 8% in the most extreme cases, averaged over both disaster and non-disaster years for the period from1970 to 2010. [4.5.2, 4.5.4]
Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in
economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters ( high confidence ). Long-term trends in economic
disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate change,but a role for climate change has not been excluded ( high agreement, medium evidence ). These conclusions
are subject to a number of limitations in studies to date. Vulnerability is a key factor in disaster losses, yet it is not well
accounted for. Other limitations are: (i) data availability, as most data are available for standard economic sectors in
developed countries; and (ii) type of hazards studied, as most studies focus on cyclones, where confidence in observed
trends and attribution of changes to human influence is low. The second conclusion is subject to additional limitations:
(iii) the processes used to adjust loss data over time, and (iv) record length. [4.5.3]

Disaster Risk Management and Adaptation to Climate
Change: Past Experience with Climate Extremes
Past experience with climate extremes contributes to understanding of effective disaster risk management and
adaptation approaches to manage risks.
The severity of the impacts of climate extremes depends strongly on the level of the exposure and
vulnerability to these extremes ( high confidence ). [2.1.1, 2.3, 2.5] 
Trends in exposure and vulnerability are major drivers of changes in disaster risk ( high confidence ). [2.5]
Understanding the multi-faceted nature of both exposure and vulnerability is a prerequisite for determining howweather and climate events contribute to the occurrence of disasters, and for designing and implementing effectiveadaptation and disaster risk management strategies. [2.2, 2.6] Vulnerability reduction is a core common element ofadaptation and disaster risk management. [2.2, 2.3]
Development practice, policy, and outcomes are critical to shaping disaster risk, which may be increased
by shortcomings in development ( high confidence ). [1.1.2, 1.1.3] High exposure and vulnerability are generally
the outcome of skewed development processes such as those associated with environmental degradation, rapid andunplanned urbanization in hazardous areas, failures of governance, and the scarcity of livelihood options for the poor.[2.2.2, 2.5] Increasing global interconnectivity and the mutual interdependence of economic and ecological systemscan have sometimes contrasting effects, reducing or amplifying vulnerability and disaster risk. [7.2.1] Countries moreeffectively manage disaster risk if they include considerations of disaster risk in national development and sector plansand if they adopt climate change adaptation strategies, translating these plans and strategies into actions targetingvulnerable areas and groups. [6.2, 6.5.2]
Data on disasters and disaster risk reduction are lacking at the local level, which can constrain improvements
in local vulnerability reduction ( high agreement, medium evidence ). [5.7] There are few examples of national
disaster risk management systems and associated risk management measures explicitly integrating knowledge of anduncertainties in projected changes in exposure, vulnerability, and climate extremes. [6.6.2, 6.6.4]
Inequalities influence local coping and adaptive capacity, and pose disaster risk management and adaptation
challenges from the local to national levels ( high agreement, robust evidence ).These inequalities reflect
socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related differences and differences in governance, access to livelihoods,entitlements, and other factors. [5.5.1, 6.2] Inequalities also exist across countries: developed countries are often betterequipped financially and institutionally to adopt explicit measures to effectively respond and adapt to projected
changes in exposure, vulnerability, and climate extremes than are developing countries. Nonetheless, all countries face
challenges in assessing, understanding, and responding to such projected changes. [6.3.2, 6.6]
Humanitarian relief is often required when disaster risk reduction measures are absent or inadequate
(high agreement, robust evidence ). [5.2.1] Smaller or economically less-diversified countries face particular
challenges in providing the public goods associated with disaster risk management, in absorbing the losses caused byclimate extremes and disasters, and in providing relief and reconstruction assistance. [6.4.3] 
Post-disaster recovery and reconstruction provide an opportunity for reducing weather- and climate-related
disaster risk and for improving adaptive capacity ( high agreement, robust evidence ). An emphasis on rapidly
rebuilding houses, reconstructing infrastructure, and rehabilitating livelihoods often leads to recovering in ways that
recreate or even increase existing vulnerabilities, and that preclude longer-term planning and policy changes for
enhancing resilience and sustainable development. [5.2.3] See also assessment in Sections 8.4.1 and 8.5.2.
Risk sharing and transfer mechanisms at local, national, regional, and global scales can increase resilience
to climate extremes ( medium confidence ). Mechanisms include informal and traditional risk sharing mechanisms,11micro-insurance, insurance, reinsurance, and national, regional, and global risk pools. [5.6.3, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 7.4] These
mechanisms are linked to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation by providing means to finance relief,recovery of livelihoods, and reconstruction; reducing vulnerability; and providing knowledge and incentives for reducingrisk. [5.5.2, 6.2.2] Under certain conditions, however, such mechanisms can provide disincentives for reducing disasterrisk. [5.6.3, 6.5.3, 7.4.4] Uptake of formal risk sharing and transfer mechanisms is unequally distributed across regionsand hazards. [6.5.3] See also Case Study 9.2.13.
Attention to the temporal and spatial dynamics of exposure and vulnerability is particularly important
given that the design and implementation of adaptation and disaster risk management strategies andpolicies can reduce risk in the short term, but may increase exposure and vulnerability over the longer
term ( high agreement, medium evidence ). For instance, dike systems can reduce flood exposure by offering
immediate protection, but also encourage settlement patterns that may increase risk in the long term. [2.4.2, 2.5.4,2.6.2] See also assessment in Sections 1.4.3, 5.3.2, and 8.3.1.
National systems are at the core of countries’ capacity to meet the challenges of observed and projected
trends in exposure, vulnerability, and weather and climate extremes ( high agreement, robust evidence ).
Effective national systems comprise multiple actors from national and sub-national governments, the private sector,research bodies, and civil society including community-based organizations, playing differential but complementaryroles to manage risk, according to their accepted functions and capacities. [6.2]
Closer integration of disaster risk management and climate change adaptation, along with the incorporation
of both into local, sub-national, national, and international development policies and practices, could providebenefits at all scales ( high agreement, medium evidence ). [5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 6.4.2, 6.6, 7.4] Addressing
social welfare, quality of life, infrastructure, and livelihoods, and incorporating a multi-hazards approach into planningand action for disasters in the short term, facilitates adaptation to climate extremes in the longer term, as is increasinglyrecognized internationally. [5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.3] Strategies and policies are more effective when they acknowledge multiplestressors, different prioritized values, and competing policy goals. [8.2, 8.3, 8.7]
Future Climate Extremes, Impacts, and Disaster Losses
Future changes in exposure, vulnerability, and climate extremes resulting from natural climate variability, anthropogenicclimate change, and socioeconomic development can alter the impacts of climate extremes on natural and humansystems and the potential for disasters.
Climate Extremes and Impacts
Confidence in projecting changes in the direction and magnitude of climate extremes depends on many
factors, including the type of extreme, the region and season, the amount and quality of observational
data, the level of understanding of the underlying processes, and the reliability of their simulation in
models. Projected changes in climate extremes under different emissions scenarios5generally do not strongly diverge
in the coming two to three decades, but these signals are relatively small compared to natural climate variability over
this time frame. Even the sign of projected changes in some climate extremes over this time frame is uncertain. For
projected changes by the end of the 21st century, either model uncertainty or uncertainties associated with emissions
scenarios used becomes dominant, depending on the extreme. Low-probability, high-impact changes associated withSummary for Policymakers

Figure SPM.4A | Projected return periods for the maximum daily temperature that was exceeded on average once during a 20-year period in the lat e 20th century (1981–2000). A decrease in return period implies more
frequent extreme temperature events (i.e., less time between events on average). The box plots show results for regionally aver aged projections for two time horizons, 2046 to 2065 and 2081 to 2100, as compared to the late
20th century, and for three different SRES emissions scenarios (B1, A1B, A2) (see legend). Results are based on 12 global clima te models (GCMs) contributing to the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP3). The level of agreement among the models is indicated by the size of the colored boxes (in which 50% of the model proje ctions are contained), and the length of the whiskers (indicating the maximum and minimum
projections from all models). See legend for defined extent of regions. Values are computed for land points only. The ‘Globe’ i nset box displays the values computed using all land grid points. [3.3.1, Figure 3-1, Figure 3-5]13the crossing of poorly understood climate thresholds cannot be excluded, given the transient and complex nature of
the climate system. Assigning ‘low confidence’ for projections of a specific extreme neither implies nor excludes thepossibility of changes in this extreme. The following assessments of the likelihood and/or confidence of projections aregenerally for the end of the 21st century and relative to the climate at the end of the 20th century. [3.1.5, 3.1.7, 3.2.3,Box 3-2]
Models project substantial warming in temperature extremes by the end of the 21st century. It is virtually
certain that increases in the frequency and magnitude of warm daily temperature extremes and decreases in cold
extremes will occur in the 21st century at the global scale. It is very likely that the length, frequency, and/or intensity
of warm spells or heat waves will increase over most land areas. Based on the A1B and A2 emissions scenarios, a1-in-20 year hottest day is likely to become a 1-in-2 year event by the end of the 21st century in most regions, except
in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is likely to become a 1-in-5 year event (see Figure SPM.4A).
Under the B1 scenario, a 1-in-20 year event would likely become a 1-in-5 year event (and a 1-in-10 year event in
Northern Hemisphere high latitudes). The 1-in-20 year extreme daily maximum temperature (i.e., a value that wasexceeded on average only once during the period 1981–2000) will likely increase by about 1°C to 3°C by the mid-21st
century and by about 2°C to 5°C by the late 21st century, depending on the region and emissions scenario (based onthe B1, A1B, and A2 scenarios). [3.3.1, 3.1.6, Table 3-3, Figure 3-5]
It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls will
increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe. This is particularly the case in the high latitudes and
tropical regions, and in winter in the northern mid-latitudes. Heavy rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones are likely
to increase with continued warming. There is medium confidence that, in some regions, increases in heavy precipitation
will occur despite projected decreases in total precipitation in those regions. Based on a range of emissions scenarios(B1, A1B, A2), a 1-in-20 year annual maximum daily precipitation amount is likely to become a 1-in-5 to 1-in-15 year
event by the end of the 21st century in many regions, and in most regions the higher emissions scenarios (A1B and A2)lead to a stronger projected decrease in return period. See Figure SPM.4B. [3.3.2, 3.4.4, Table 3-3, Figure 3-7]
Average tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is likely to increase, although increases may not occur in
all ocean basins. It is likely that the global frequency of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain
essentially unchanged. [3.4.4]
There is medium confidence that there will be a reduction in the number of extratropical cyclones averaged
over each hemisphere. While there is low confidence in the detailed geographical projections of extratropical
cyclone activity, there is medium confidence in a projected poleward shift of extratropical storm tracks .There is low
confidence in projections of small spatial-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail because competing physical
processes may affect future trends and because current climate models do not simulate such phenomena. [3.3.2, 3.3.3,
3.4.5]
There is medium confidence that droughts will intensify in the 21st century in some seasons and areas, due
to reduced precipitation and/or increased evapotranspiration. This applies to regions including southern Europe
and the Mediterranean region, central Europe, central North America, Central America and Mexico, northeast Brazil,
and southern Africa. Elsewhere there is overall low confidence because of inconsistent projections of drought changes
(dependent both on model and dryness index). Definitional issues, lack of observational data, and the inability of modelsto include all the factors that influence droughts preclude stronger confidence than medium in drought projections.
See Figure SPM.5. [3.5.1, Table 3-3, Box 3-3]
Projected precipitation and temperature changes imply possible changes in floods, although overall there
is low confidence in projections of changes in fluvial floods. Confidence is lowdue to limited evidence and
because the causes of regional changes are complex, although there are exceptions to this statement. There is medium
confidence (based on physical reasoning) that projected increases in heavy rainfall would contribute to increases in
local flooding in some catchments or regions. [3.5.2]Summary for Policymakers14Summary for Policymakers

It is very likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to upward trends in extreme coastal high water
levels in the future. There is high confidence that locations currently experiencing adverse impacts such as coastal
erosion and inundation will continue to do so in the future due to increasing sea levels, all other contributing factorsbeing equal. The very likely contribution of mean sea level rise to increased extreme coastal high water levels, coupled
with the likely increase in tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, is a specific issue for tropical small island states.
[3.5.3, 3.5.5, Box 3-4]
There is high confidence that changes in heat waves, glacial retreat, and/or permafrost degradation will
affect high mountain phenomena such as slope instabilities, movements of mass, and glacial lake outburstfloods. There is also high confidence that changes in heavy precipitation will affect landslides in some regions. [3.5.6]
There is low confidence in projections of changes in large-scale patterns of natural climate variability.
Confidence is low in projections of changes in monsoons (rainfall, circulation) because there is little consensus in climate
models regarding the sign of future change in the monsoons. Model projections of changes in El Niño–Southern

[3.5.1, Figure 3-9]E.
16Summary for Policymakers
Oscillation variability and the frequency of El Niño episodes are not consistent, and so there is low confidence in
projections of changes in this phenomenon. [3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3]
Human Impacts and Disaster Losses
Extreme events will have greater impacts on sectors with closer links to climate, such as water, agricultureand food security, forestry, health, and tourism. For example, while it is not currently possible to reliably project
specific changes at the catchment scale, there is high confidence that changes in climate have the potential to seriously
affect water management systems. However, climate change is in many instances only one of the drivers of futurechanges, and is not necessarily the most important driver at the local scale. Climate-related extremes are also expectedto produce large impacts on infrastructure, although detailed analysis of potential and projected damages are limitedto a few countries, infrastructure types, and sectors. [4.3.2, 4.3.5]
In many regions, the main drivers of future increases in economic losses due to some climate extremes will
be socioeconomic in nature ( medium confidence , based on medium agreement , limited evidence ). Climate
extremes are only one of the factors that affect risks, but few studies have specifically quantified the effects ofchanges in population, exposure of people and assets, and vulnerability as determinants of loss. However, the fewstudies available generally underline the important role of projected changes (increases) in population and capital atrisk. [4.5.4]
Increases in exposure will result in higher direct economic losses from tropical cyclones. Losses will also
depend on future changes in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity ( high confidence ). Overall losses due to
extratropical cyclones will also increase, with possible decreases or no change in some areas ( medium confidence ).
Although future flood losses in many locations will increase in the absence of additional protection measures ( high
agreement, medium evidence ), the size of the estimated change is highly variable, depending on location, climate
scenarios used, and methods used to assess impacts on river flow and flood occurrence. [4.5.4]
Disasters associated with climate extremes influence population mobility and relocation, affecting host and
origin communities ( medium agreement, medium evidence ). If disasters occur more frequently and/or with greater
magnitude, some local areas will become increasingly marginal as places to live or in which to maintain livelihoods. Insuch cases, migration and displacement could become permanent and could introduce new pressures in areas ofrelocation. For locations such as atolls, in some cases it is possible that many residents will have to relocate. [5.2.2]
Managing Changing Risks
of Climate Extremes and Disasters
Adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management provide a range of complementary approaches for
managing the risks of climate extremes and disasters (Figure SPM.2). Effectively applying and combining approaches
may benefit from considering the broader challenge of sustainable development.
Measures that provide benefits under current climate and a range of future climate change scenarios,
called low-regrets measures, are available starting points for addressing projected trends in exposure,
vulnerability, and climate extremes. They have the potential to offer benefits now and lay the foundation
for addressing projected changes ( high agreement, medium evidence ). Many of these low-regrets strategies
produce co-benefits, help address other development goals, such as improvements in livelihoods, human well-being,
and biodiversity conservation, and help minimize the scope for maladaptation. [6.3.1, Table 6-1] 
Potential low-regrets measures include early warning systems; risk communication between decisionmakers and local
citizens; sustainable land management, including land use planning; and ecosystem management and restoration.17Other low-regrets measures include improvements to health surveillance, water supply, sanitation, and irrigation and
drainage systems; climate-proofing of infrastructure; development and enforcement of building codes; and bettereducation and awareness. [5.3.1, 5.3.3, 6.3.1, 6.5.1, 6.5.2] See also Case Studies 9.2.11 and 9.2.14, and assessment inSection 7.4.3.
Effective risk management generally involves a portfolio of actions to reduce and transfer risk and to
respond to events and disasters, as opposed to a singular focus on any one action or type of action ( high
confidence ). [1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.3.3] Such integrated approaches are more effective when they are informed by and
customized to specific local circumstances ( high agreement, robust evidence ). [5.1] Successful strategies include a
combination of hard infrastructure-based responses and soft solutions such as individual and institutional capacitybuilding and ecosystem-based responses. [6.5.2] 
Multi-hazard risk management approaches provide opportunities to reduce complex and compound hazards
(high agreement, robust evidence ). Considering multiple types of hazards reduces the likelihood that risk reduction
efforts targeting one type of hazard will increase exposure and vulnerability to other hazards, in the present andfuture. [8.2.5, 8.5.2, 8.7]
Opportunities exist to create synergies in international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation
to climate change, but these have not yet been fully realized ( high confidence ). International funding for
disaster risk reduction remains relatively low as compared to the scale of spending on international humanitarianresponse. [7.4.2] Technology transfer and cooperation to advance disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptationare important. Coordination on technology transfer and cooperation between these two fields has been lacking, whichhas led to fragmented implementation. [7.4.3]
Stronger efforts at the international level do not necessarily lead to substantive and rapid results at the
local level ( high confidence ). There is room for improved integration across scales from international to local. [7.6]
Integration of local knowledge with additional scientific and technical knowledge can improve disaster
risk reduction and climate change adaptation ( high agreement, robust evidence ).Local populations document
their experiences with the changing climate, particularly extreme weather events, in many different ways, and this self-generated knowledge can uncover existing capacity within the community and important current shortcomings. [5.4.4]Local participation supports community-based adaptation to benefit management of disaster risk and climateextremes. However, improvements in the availability of human and financial capital and of disaster risk and climateinformation customized for local stakeholders can enhance community-based adaptation ( medium agreement, medium
evidence) . [5.6]
Appropriate and timely risk communication is critical for effective adaptation and disaster risk management
(high confidence ). Explicit characterization of uncertainty and complexity strengthens risk communication. [2.6.3]
Effective risk communication builds on exchanging, sharing, and integrating knowledge about climate-related risks
among all stakeholder groups. Among individual stakeholders and groups, perceptions of risk are driven by psychologicaland cultural factors, values, and beliefs. [1.1.4, 1.3.1, 1.4.2] See also assessment in Section 7.4.5.
An iterative process of monitoring, research, evaluation, learning, and innovation can reduce disaster risk
and promote adaptive management in the context of climate extremes ( high agreement , robust evidence ).
[8.6.3, 8.7] Adaptation efforts benefit from iterative risk management strategies because of the complexity, uncertainties,and long time frame associated with climate change ( high confidence ). [1.3.2] Addressing knowledge gaps through
enhanced observation and research can reduce uncertainty and help in designing effective adaptation and risk
management strategies. [3.2, 6.2.5, Table 6-3, 7.5, 8.6.3] See also assessment in Section 6.6.
Table SPM.1 presents examples of how observed and projected trends in exposure, vulnerability, and
climate extremes can inform risk management and adaptation strategies, policies, and measures. TheSummary for Policymakers18Summary for Policymakers
Table SPM.1 | Illustrative examples of options for risk management and adaptation in the context of changes in exposure, vulnerability, and c limate extremes. In each example, information is characterized at the
scale directly relevant to decisionmaking. Observed and projected changes in climate extremes at global and regional scales ill ustrate that the direction of, magnitude of, and/or degree of certainty for changes may
differ across scales.
The examples were selected based on availability of evidence in the underlying chapters, including on exposure, vulnerability, climate information, and risk management and adaptation options. They are intended
to reflect relevant risk management themes and scales, rather than to provide comprehensive information by region. The examples  are not intended to reflect any regional differences in exposure and vulnerability, or in
experience in risk management.
The confidence in projected changes in climate extremes at local scales is often more limited than the confidence in projected regional and global changes. This limited confidence in changes places a focus on
low-regrets risk management options that aim to reduce exposure and vulnerability and to increase resilience and preparedness f or risks that cannot be entirely eliminated. Higher-confidence projected changes in
climate extremes, at a scale relevant to adaptation and risk management decisions, can inform more targeted adjustments in stra tegies, policies, and measures. [3.1.6, Box 3-2, 6.3.1, 6.5.2]
Observed:  Low conﬁdence at global scale 
regarding (climate-driven) observed changes in 
the magnitude and frequency of ﬂoods.
Projected:  Low conﬁdence  in projections of 
changes in ﬂoods because of limited evidence 
and because the causes of regional changes are complex. However, medium conﬁdence  (based on 
physical reasoning) that projected increases in heavy precipitation will contribute to 
rain-generated local ﬂooding in some 
catchments or regions.
[Table 3-1, 3.5.2]Rapid expansion of poor people living 
in informal settlements around 
Nairobi has led to houses of weak building materials being constructed immediately adjacent to rivers and to blockage of natural drainage areas, increasing exposure and vulnerability.
[6.4.2, Box 6-2] Observed:  Low conﬁdence  regarding 
trends in heavy precipitation in East 
Africa, because of insufﬁcient evidence.
Projected:  Likely  increase in heavy 
precipitation indicators in East Africa. 
[Table 3-2, Table 3-3, 3.3.2]Limited ability to provide local ﬂash 
ﬂood projections.
[3.5.2]Low-regrets options that reduce exposure and 
vulnerability across a range of hazard trends:
• Strengthening building design and regulation
• Poverty reduction schemes 
• City-wide drainage and sewerage improvements
The Nairobi Rivers Rehabilitation and Restoration 
Programme includes installation of riparian buffers, canals, and drainage channels and clearance of existing channels; attention to climate variability and change in 
the location and design of wastewater infrastructure; and 
environmental monitoring for ﬂood early warning.
[6.3, 6.4.2, Box 6-2, Box 6-6]Observed:  Likely increase in extreme coastal 
high water worldwide related to increases in 
mean sea level.
Projected:  Very likely  that mean sea level rise 
will contribute to upward trends in extreme 
coastal high water levels. High conﬁdence that locations currently 
experiencing coastal erosion and inundation will 
continue to do so due to increasing sea level, in 
the absence of changes in other contributing factors. Likely  that the global frequency of tropical 
cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged.Likely increase in average tropical cyclone 
maximum wind speed, although increases may 
not occur in all ocean basins.
[Table 3-1, 3.4.4, 3.5.3, 3.5.5]Sparse regional and temporal coverage 
of terrestrial-based observation networks and limited in situ ocean 
observing network, but with improved 
satellite-based observations in recent decades.
While changes in storminess may 
contribute to changes in extreme coastal high water levels, the limited geographical coverage of studies to date and the uncertainties associated with 
storminess changes overall mean that a 
general assessment of the effects of storminess changes on storm surge is not possible at this time.
[Box 3-4, 3.5.3]Low-regrets options that reduce exposure and 
vulnerability across a range of hazard trends:• Maintenance of drainage systems
• Well technologies to limit saltwater contamination of 
groundwater
• Improved early warning systems
• Regional risk pooling
• Mangrove conservation, restoration, and replanting
Speciﬁc adaptation options include, for instance, 
rendering national economies more climate-independent and adaptive management involving iterative learning. In 
some cases there may be a need to consider relocation, 
for example, for atolls where storm surges may completely inundate them.
[4.3.5, 4.4.10, 5.2.2, 6.3.2, 6.5.2, 6.6.2, 7.4.4, 9.2.9, 
9.2.11, 9.2.13]Observed:  Tides and El Niño–Southern 
Oscillation have contributed to the more 
frequent occurrence of extreme coastal high water levels and associated ﬂooding experienced on some Paciﬁc Islands in recent years. 
Projected:  The very likely  contribution 
of mean sea level rise to increased 
extreme coastal high water levels, coupled with the likely  increase in 
tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, is 
a speciﬁc issue for tropical small island states. See global changes column for information on global projections for tropical cyclones. 
[Box 3-4, 3.4.4, 3.5.3]Small island states in the Paciﬁc, 
Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, often with low elevation, are particularly 
vulnerable to rising sea levels and 
impacts such as erosion, inundation, shoreline change, and saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. These impacts can result in ecosystem disruption, decreased agricultural productivity, changes in disease patterns, economic losses such as in 
tourism industries, and population 
displacement – all of which reinforce vulnerability to extreme weather events.

Observed:  Medium conﬁdence that the length

increased since the middle of the 20th century, in 
many (but not all) regions over the globe.Very likely  increase in number of warm days and 
nights at the global scale.
Projected:  Very likely  increase in length,

Virtually certain  increase in frequency and 
magnitude of warm days and nights at the global scale.
[Table 3-1, 3.3.1]Observations and projections can

areas in the region, with increased heat

[3.3.1, 4.4.5]Low-regrets options that reduce exposure and 
vulnerability across a range of hazard trends:
• Early warning systems that reach particularly 
vulnerable groups (e.g., the elderly)
• Vulnerability mapping and corresponding measures
• Public information on what to do during heat waves, 
including behavioral advice 
• Use of social care networks to reach vulnerable 
groups
Speciﬁc adjustments in strategies, policies, and measures 
informed by trends in heat waves include awareness raising of heat waves as a public health concern; changes in urban infrastructure and land use planning, for 
example, increasing urban green space; changes in 
approaches to cooling for public facilities; and adjustments in energy generation and transmission infrastructure.
[Table 6-1, 9.2.1]Observed:  Medium conﬁdence  in 
increase in heat waves or warm spells in 
Europe.Likely  overall increase in warm days and 
nights over most of the continent.
Projected:  Likely more frequent, longer, 
and/or more intense heat waves or 
warm spells in Europe.Very likely increase in warm days and 
nights.
[Table 3-2, Table 3-3, 3.3.1]Factors affecting exposure and 
vulnerability include age, pre-existing 
health status, level of outdoor 
activity, socioeconomic factors including poverty and social isolation, access to and use of cooling, 
physiological and behavioral 
adaptation of the population, and 
urban infrastructure.
[2.5.2, 4.3.5, 4.3.6, 4.4.5, 9.2.1]
Observed:  Low conﬁdence in any observed 
long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in 
tropical cyclone activity, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities.
Projected:  Likely  that the global frequency of 
tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain 
essentially unchanged.Likely  increase in average tropical cyclone 
maximum wind speed, although increases may 
not occur in all ocean basins.Heavy rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones are likely  to increase.
Projected sea level rise is expected to further 
compound tropical cyclone surge impacts.
[Table 3-1, 3.4.4]Limited model capability to project 
changes relevant to speciﬁc settlements 
or other locations, due to the inability of global models to accurately simulate factors relevant to tropical cyclone 
genesis, track, and intensity evolution.
[3.4.4]Low-regrets options that reduce exposure and 
vulnerability across a range of hazard trends:
• Adoption and enforcement of improved building 
codes
• Improved forecasting capacity and implementation of 
improved early warning systems (including 
evacuation plans and infrastructures)
• Regional risk pooling
In the context of high underlying variability and 
uncertainty regarding trends, options can include 
emphasizing adaptive management involving learning and ﬂexibility (e.g., Cayman Islands National Hurricane Committee).
[5.5.3, 6.5.2, 6.6.2, Box 6-7, Table 6-1, 7.4.4, 9.2.5, 
9.2.11, 9.2.13]See global changes column for global 
projections.Exposure and vulnerability are 
increasing due to growth in 
population and increase in property 
values, particularly along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States. Some of this increase has been offset 
by improved building codes.

importance of these trends for decisionmaking depends on their magnitude and degree of certainty at the temporal
and spatial scale of the risk being managed and on the available capacity to implement risk management options(see Table SPM.1).
Implications for Sustainable Development
Actions that range from incremental steps to transformational changes are essential for reducing risk fromclimate extremes ( high agreement, robust evidence ).Incremental steps aim to improve efficiency within existing
technological, governance, and value systems, whereas transformation may involve alterations of fundamental attributesof those systems. Transformations, where they are required, are also facilitated through increased emphasis on adaptivemanagement and learning. Where vulnerability is high and adaptive capacity low, changes in climate extremes canmake it difficult for systems to adapt sustainably without transformational changes. Vulnerability is often concentratedin lower-income countries or groups, although higher-income countries or groups can also be vulnerable to climateextremes. [8.6, 8.6.3, 8.7] 
Social, economic, and environmental sustainability can be enhanced by disaster risk management and
adaptation approaches. A prerequisite for sustainability in the context of climate change is addressing theunderlying causes of vulnerability, including the structural inequalities that create and sustain poverty andconstrain access to resources ( medium agreement, robust evidence ).This involves integrating disaster risk
management and adaptation into all social, economic, and environmental policy domains. [8.6.2, 8.7]
The most effective adaptation and disaster risk reduction actions are those that offer development benefits
in the relatively near term, as well as reductions in vulnerability over the longer term ( high agreement,
medium evidence ).There are tradeoffs between current decisions and long-term goals linked to diverse values,
interests, and priorities for the future. Short- and long-term perspectives on disaster risk management and adaptationto climate change thus can be difficult to reconcile. Such reconciliation involves overcoming the disconnect betweenlocal risk management practices and national institutional and legal frameworks, policy, and planning. [8.2.1, 8.3.1,8.3.2, 8.6.1]
Progress toward resilient and sustainable development in the context of changing climate extremes can
benefit from questioning assumptions and paradigms and stimulating innovation to encourage newpatterns of response ( medium agreement, robust evidence ).Successfully addressing disaster risk, climate
change, and other stressors often involves embracing broad participation in strategy development, the capacity tocombine multiple perspectives, and contrasting ways of organizing social relations. [8.2.5, 8.6.3, 8.7] 
The interactions among climate change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk management may have a
major influence on resilient and sustainable pathways ( high agreement, limited evidence ). Interactions
between the goals of mitigation and adaptation in particular will play out locally, but have global consequences.
[8.2.5, 8.5.2]
There are many approaches and pathways to a sustainable and resilient future. [8.2.3, 8.4.1, 8.6.1, 8.7] However, limits
to resilience are faced when thresholds or tipping points associated with social and/or natural systems are exceeded,
posing severe challenges for adaptation. [8.5.1] Choices and outcomes for adaptive actions to climate events must
reflect divergent capacities and resources and multiple interacting processes. Actions are framed by tradeoffs between
competing prioritized values and objectives, and different visions of development that can change over time. Iterative
approaches allow development pathways to integrate risk management so that diverse policy solutions can be
considered, as risk and its measurement, perception, and understanding evolve over time. [8.2.3, 8.4.1, 8.6.1, 8.7]21Summary for Policymakers
Box SPM.2 | Treatment of Uncertainty
Based on the Guidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties,6this
Summary for Policymakers relies on two metrics for communicating the degree of certainty in key findings, which is based on aut hor
teams’ evaluations of underlying scientific understanding: • Confidence in the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., mechanistic
understanding, theory, data, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement. Confidence is expressed qualitatively.
• Quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding expressed probabilistically (based on statistical analysis of observations or model
results, or expert judgment).
This Guidance Note refines the guidance provided to support the IPCC Third and Fourth Assessment Reports. Direct comparisons be tween
assessment of uncertainties in findings in this report and those in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report are difficult if not impo ssible,
because of the application of the revised guidance note on uncertainties, as well as the availability of new information, impro ved
scientific understanding, continued analyses of data and models, and specific differences in methodologies applied in the asses sed
studies. For some extremes, different aspects have been assessed and therefore a direct comparison would be inappropriate.
Each key finding is based on an author team’s evaluation of associated evidence and agreement. The confidence metric provides a
qualitative synthesis of an author team’s judgment about the validity of a finding, as determined through evaluation of evidenc e and
agreement. If uncertainties can be quantified probabilistically, an author team can characterize a finding using the calibrated  likelihood
language or a more precise presentation of probability. Unless otherwise indicated, high or very high confidence is associated with
findings for which an author team has assigned a likelihood term.
The following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited , medium , or robust ; and for the degree of
agreement: low, medium , or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low , low, medium , high, and very high . The
accompanying figure depicts summary statements for evidence and agreement and their relationship to confidence. There is flexib ility in
this relationship; for a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing le vels of
evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence.
The following terms indicate the assessed likelihood:
Term* Likelihood of the Outcome
Virtually certain 99–100% probability
Very likely 90–100% probability
Likely 66–100% probability
About as likely as not 33–66% probability
Unlikely 0–33% probability
Very unlikely 0–10% probability
Exceptionally unlikely 0–1% probability
* Additional terms that were used in limited circumstances in the Fourth
Assessment Report ( extremely likely: 95–100% probability, more likely than
not:>50–100% probability, and extremely unlikely: 0–5% probability) may
also be used when appropriate.

Table of Contents27Disaster signifies extreme impacts suffered when hazardous physical events interact with vulnerable social
conditions to severely alter the normal functioning of a community or a society ( high confidence) . Social
vulnerability and exposure are key determinants of disaster risk and help explain why non-extreme physical eventsand chronic hazards can also lead to extreme impacts and disasters, while some extreme events do not. Extremeimpacts on human, ecological, or physical systems derive from individual extreme or non-extreme events, or acompounding of events or their impacts (for example, drought creating the conditions for wildfire, followed by heavyrain leading to landslides and soil erosion). [1.1.2.1, 1.1.2.3, 1.2.3.1, 1.3] 
Management strategies based on the reduction of everyday or chronic risk factors and on the reduction of
risk associated with non-extreme events, as opposed to strategies based solely on the exceptional orextreme, provide a mechanism that facilitates the reduction of disaster risk and the preparation for andresponse to extremes and disasters ( high confidence) . Effective adaptation to climate change requires an
understanding of the diverse ways in which social processes and development pathways shape disaster risk. Disasterrisk is often causally related to ongoing, chronic, or persistent environmental, economic, or social risk factors. [1.1.2.2,1.1.3, 1.1.4.1, 1.3.2] 
Development practice, policy, and outcomes are critical to shaping disaster risk ( high confidence ). Disaster
risk may be increased by shortcomings in development. Reductions in the rate of depletion of ecosystem services,improvements in urban land use and territorial organization processes, the strengthening of rural livelihoods, andgeneral and specific advances in urban and rural governance advance the composite agenda of poverty reduction,disaster risk reduction, and adaptation to climate change. [1.1.2.1, 1.1.2.2, 1.1.3, 1.3.2, 1.3.3] 
Climate change will pose added challenges for the appropriate allocation of efforts to manage disaster
risk ( high confidence ). The potential for changes in all characteristics of climate will complicate the evaluation,
communication, and management of the resulting risk. [1.1.3.1, 1.1.3.2, 1.2.2.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.4.3] 
Risk assessment is one starting point, within the broader risk governance framework, for adaptation to
climate change and disaster risk reduction and transfer ( high confidence ). The assessment and analysis process
may employ a variety of tools according to management context, access to data and technology, and stakeholdersinvolved. These tools will vary from formalized probabilistic risk analysis to local level, participatory risk and contextanalysis methodologies. [1.3, 1.3.1.2, 1.3.3, Box 1-2] 
Risk assessment encounters difficulties in estimating the likelihood and magnitude of extreme events and
their impacts ( high confidence ). Furthermore, among individual stakeholders and groups, perceptions of risk are
driven by psychological and cultural factors, values, and beliefs. Effective risk communication requires exchanging,
sharing, and integrating knowledge about climate-related risks among all stakeholder groups. [Box 1-1, 1.1.4.1,1.2.2.1, 1.3.1.1, 1.3.1.2, Box 1-2, Box 1-3, 1.4.2] 
Management of the risk associated with climate extremes, extreme impacts, and disasters benefits from
an integrated systems approach, as opposed to separately managing individual types of risk or risk in
particular locations ( high confidence ). Effective risk management generally involves a portfolio of actions to
reduce and transfer risk and to respond to events and disasters, as opposed to a singular focus on any one action ortype of action. [1.1.2.2, 1.1.4.1, 1.3, 1.3.3, 1.4.2]
Learning is central to adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the concepts, goals, and processes of
adaptation share much in common with disaster risk management, particularly its disaster risk reductioncomponent ( high confidence ). Disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change offer frameworks for, and
examples of, advanced learning processes that may help reduce or avoid barriers that undermine planned adaptationefforts or lead to implementation of maladaptive measures. Due to the deep uncertainty, dynamic complexity, andChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
Executive Summary28long timeframe associated with climate change, robust adaptation efforts would require iterative risk management
strategies. [1.1.3, 1.3.2, 1.4.1.2, 1.4.2, 1.4.5, Box 1-4] 
Projected trends and uncertainty in hazards, exposure, and vulnerability associated with climate change
and development make return to the status quo, coping, or static resilience increasingly insufficient goalsfor disaster risk management and adaptation ( high confidence ). Recent approaches to resilience of social-
ecological systems expand beyond these concepts to include the ability to self-organize, learn, and adapt over time.[1.1.2.1, 1.1.2.2, 1.4.1.2, 1.4.2, 1.4.4] 
Given shortcomings of past disaster risk management and the new dimension of climate change, greatly
improved and strengthened disaster risk management and adaptation will be needed, as part ofdevelopment processes, in order to reduce future risk ( high confidence ). Efforts will be more effective when
informed by the experience and success with disaster risk management in different regions during recent decades, andappropriate approaches for risk identification, reduction, transfer, and disaster management. In the future, thepractices of disaster risk management and adaptation can each greatly benefit from far greater synergy and linkage ininstitutional, financial, policy, strategic, and practical terms. [1.1.1, 1.1.2.2, 1.1.3, 1.3.3, 1.4.2] 
Community participation in planning, the determined use of local and community knowledge and capacities,
and the decentralization of decisionmaking, supported by and in synergy with national and internationalpolicies and actions, are critical for disaster risk reduction ( high confidence ). The use of local level risk and
context analysis methodologies, inspired by disaster risk management and now strongly accepted by many civil societyand government agencies in work on adaptation at the local levels, would foster greater integration between, andgreater effectiveness of, both adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management. [1.1.2.2, 1.1.4.2, 1.3.3, 1.4.2] Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience291.1. Introduction 
1.1.1. Purpose and Scope of the Special Report
Climate change , an alteration in the state of the climate that can be
identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties,and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer, isa fundamental reference point for framing the different management
themes and challenges dealt with in this Special Report. 
Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external
forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition ofthe atmosphere or in land use (see Chapter 3 for greater detail).Anthropogenic climate change is projected to continue during thiscentury and beyond. This conclusion is robust under a wide range ofscenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions, including some thatanticipate a reduction in emissions (IPCC, 2007a). 
While specific, local outcomes of climate change are uncertain, recent
assessments project alteration in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent,or duration of weather and climate extremes, including climate andhydrometeorological events such as heat waves, heavy precipitationevents, drought, and tropical cyclones (see Chapter 3). Such change, ina context of increasing vulnerability, will lead to increased stress onhuman and natural systems and a propensity for serious adverse effectsin many places around the world (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). At the sametime, climate change is also expected to bring benefits to certain placesand communities at particular times.
New, improved or strengthened processes for anticipating and dealing
with the adverse effects associated with weather and climate eventswill be needed in many areas. This conclusion is supported by the factthat despite increasing knowledge and understanding of the factorsthat lead to adverse effects, and despite important advances overrecent decades in the reduction of loss of life with the occurrence ofhydrometeorological events (mainly attributable to important advanceswith early warning systems, e.g., Section 9.2.11), social intervention inthe face of historical climate variability has not kept pace with the rapidincreases in other adverse economic and social effects suffered during
this period (ICSU, 2008) (high confidence) . Instead, a rapid growth in
real economic losses and livelihood disruption has occurred in many
parts of the world (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). In regard to losses associated
with tropical cyclones, recent analysis has shown that, with the exceptionof the East Asian and Pacific and South Asian regions, “both exposureand the estimated risk of economic loss are growing faster than GDP
per capita. Thus the risk of losing wealth in disasters associated with
tropical cyclones is increasing faster than wealth itself is increasing”(UNISDR, 2011, p. 33).
The Hyogo Framework for Action (UNISDR, 2005), adopted by 168
governments, provides a point of reference for disaster risk managementand its practical implementation (see Glossary and Section 1.1.2.2 for a
definition of this practice). Subsequent United Nations statementssuggest the need for closer integration of disaster risk management and
adaptation with climate change concerns and goals, all in the context ofdevelopment and development planning (UNISDR, 2008a, 2009a,b,c).Such a concern led to the agreement between the IPCC and the UnitedNations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), withthe support of the Norwegian government, to undertake this SpecialReport on “Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters toAdvance Climate Change Adaptation” (IPCC, 2009).
This Special Report responds to that concern by considering climate
change and its effects on extreme (weather and climate) events, disaster,and disaster risk management; how human responses to extremeevents and disasters (based on historical experience and evolution inpractice) could contribute to adaptation objectives and processes; andhow adaptation to climate change could be more closely integratedwith disaster risk management practice. 
The report draws on current scientific knowledge to address three
specific goals:
1)To assess the relevance and utility of the concepts, methods,strategies, instruments, and experience gained from the managementof climate-associated disaster risk under conditions of historicalclimate patterns, in order to advance adaptation to climate changeand the management of extreme events and disasters in thefuture.
2)To assess the new perspectives and challenges that climate changebrings to the disaster risk management field.
3)To assess the mutual implications of the evolution of the disasterrisk management and adaptation to climate change fields,particularly with respect to the desired increases in social resilienceand sustainability that adaptation implies.
The principal audience for this Special Report comprises decisionmakers
and professional and technical personnel from local through to nationalgovernments, international development agencies, nongovernmentalorganizations, and civil society organizations. The report also has relevancefor the academic community and interested laypeople.
The first section of this chapter briefly introduces the more important
concepts, definitions, contexts, and management concerns needed toframe the content of this report. Later sections of the chapter expand onthe subjects of extreme events and extreme impacts; disaster riskmanagement, reduction, and transfer and their integration withclimate change and adaptation processes; and the notions of coping andadaptation. The level of detail and discussion presented in this chapteris commensurate with its status as a ‘scene setting’ initiative. Thefollowing eight chapters provide more detailed and specific analysis. 
Chapter 2 assesses the key determinants of risk, namely exposure and
vulnerability in the context of climate-related hazards. A particular focus isthe connection between near-term experience and long-term adaptation.Key questions addressed include whether reducing vulnerability tocurrent hazards improves adaptation to longer-term climate change,Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience30and how near-term risk management decisions and adjustments
constrain future vulnerability and enable adaptation.
Chapter 3 focuses on changes in extremes of atmospheric weather and
climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation), large-scalephenomena that are related to these extremes or are themselvesextremes (e.g., tropical and extratropical cyclones, El Niño, and monsoons),and collateral effects on the physical environment (e.g., droughts,floods, coastal impacts, landslides). The chapter builds on and updatesthe Fourth Assessment Report, which in some instances, due to newliterature, leads to revisions of that assessment. 
Chapter 4 explores how changes in climate, particularly weather and
climate extremes assessed in Chapter 3, translate into extreme impactson human and ecological systems. A key issue is the nature of bothobserved and expected trends in impacts, the latter resulting fromtrends in both physical and social conditions. The chapter assessesthese questions from both a regional and a sectoral perspective, and
examines the direct and indirect economic costs of such changes andtheir relation to development.
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 assess approaches to disaster risk management and
adaptation to climate change from the perspectives of local, national,and international governance institutions, taking into consideration theroles of government, individuals, nongovernmental organizations, theprivate sector, and other civil society institutions and arrangements.Each chapter reviews the efficacy of current disaster risk reduction,preparedness, and response and risk transfer strategies and previousapproaches to extremes and disasters in order to extract lessons for thefuture. Impacts, adaptation, and the cost of risk management areassessed through the prism of diverse social aggregations and meansfor cooperation, as well as a variety of institutional arrangements.
Chapter 5 focuses on the highly variable local contexts resulting from
differences in place, social groupings, experience, management,institutions, conditions, and sets of knowledge, highlighting riskmanagement strategies involving housing, buildings, and land use.Chapter 6 explores similar issues at the national level, wheremechanisms including national budgets, development goals, planning,warning systems, and building codes may be employed to manage, forexample, food security and agriculture, water resources, forests,fisheries, building practice, and public health. Chapter 7 carries thisanalysis to the international level, where the emphasis is on institutions,
organizations, knowledge generation and sharing, legal frameworks andpractices, and funding arrangements that characterize internationalagencies and collaborative arrangements. This chapter also discusses
integration of responsibilities across all governmental scales, emphasizingthe linkages among disaster risk management, climate change adaptation,and development.
Chapter 8 assesses how disaster risk reduction strategies, ranging from
incremental to transformational, can advance adaptation to climate
change and promote a more sustainable and resilient future. Keyquestions include whether an improved alignment between climate
change responses and sustainable development strategies may beachieved, and whether short- and long-term perspectives may bereconciled.
Chapter 9 closes this report by presenting case studies in order to
identify lessons and best practices from past responses to extremeclimate-related events and extreme impacts. Cases illustrate concreteand diverse examples of disaster types as well as risk managementmethodologies and responses discussed in the other chapters, providinga key reference point for the entire report.
1.1.2. Key Concepts and Definitions
The concepts and definitions presented in this chapter and employedthroughout the Special Report take into account a number of existingsources (IPCC, 2007c; UNISDR, 2009d; ISO, 2009) but also reflect the factthat concepts and definitions evolve as knowledge, needs, and contextsvary. Disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change aredynamic fields, and have in the past exhibited and will necessarilycontinue in the future to exhibit such evolution.
This chapter presents ‘skeleton’ definitions that are generic rather than
specific. In subsequent chapters, the definitions provided here are oftenexpanded in more detail and variants among these definitions will beexamined and explained where necessary. 
A glossary of the fundamental definitions used in this assessment is
provided at the end of this study. Figure 1-1 provides a schematicof the relationships among many of the key concepts defined here.
1.1.2.1. Definitions Related to General Concepts
In order to delimit the central concerns of this Special Report, a distinctionis made between those concepts and definitions that relate to disasterrisk and adaptation to climate change generally; and, on the otherhand, those that relate in particular to the options and forms of socialintervention relevant to these fields. In Section 1.1.2.1, consideration isgiven to general concepts. In Section 1.1.2.2, key concepts relating tosocial intervention through ‘Disaster Risk Management’ and ‘ClimateChange Adaptation’ are considered.
Extreme (weather and climate) events and disasters comprise the two
central risk management concerns of this Special Report.
Extreme events comprise a facet of climate variability under stable or
changing climate conditions. They are defined as the occurrence of avalue of a weather or climate variable above (or below) a thresholdvalue near the upper (or lower) ends (‘tails’) of the range of observedvalues of the variable. This definition is further discussed and amplifiedin Sections 1.2.2, 3.1.1, and 3.1.2.Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience31Disasters are defined in this report as severe alterations in the normal
functioning of a community or a society due to hazardous physical eventsinteracting with vulnerable social conditions, leading to widespreadadverse human, material, economic, or environmental effects thatrequire immediate emergency response to satisfy critical human needsand that may require external support for recovery.
The hazardous physical events referred to in the definition of disaster
may be of natural, socio-natural (originating in the human degradationor transformation of the physical environment), or purely anthropogenicorigins (see Lavell, 1996, 1999; Smith, 1996; Tobin and Montz, 1997;Wisner et al., 2004). This Special Report emphasizes hydrometeorologicaland oceanographic events; a subset of a broader spectrum of physical
events that may acquire the characteristic of a hazard if conditions of
exposure and vulnerability convert them into a threat. These include
earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis, among others. Any one geographicarea may be affected by one, or a combination of, such events at thesame or different times. Both in this report and in the wider literature,
some events (e.g., floods and droughts) are at times referred to asphysical impacts (see Section 3.1.1).
Extreme events are often but not always associated with disaster. This
association will depend on the particular physical, geographic, and social
conditions that prevail (see this section and Chapter 2 for discussion of
the conditioning circumstances associated with so-called ‘exposure’
and ‘vulnerability’) (Ball, 1975; O’Keefe et al., 1976; Timmerman, 1981;Hewitt, 1983; Maskrey, 1989; Mileti, 1999; Wisner et al., 2004).Non-extreme physical events also can and do lead to disasters where
physical or societal conditions foster such a result. In fact, a significantnumber of disasters registered annually in most disaster databasesare associated with physical events that are not extreme as defined
probabilistically, yet have important social and economic impacts onlocal communities and governments, both individually and in aggregate(UNISDR, 2009e, 2011) ( high confidence ).
For example, many of the ‘disasters’ registered in the widely consulted
University of Louvaine EM-DAT database (CRED, 2010) are not initiatedby statistically extreme events, but rather exhibit extreme propertiesexpressed as severe interruptions in the functioning of local social andeconomic systems. This lack of connection is even more obvious in theDesInventar database (Corporación OSSO, 2010), developed first inLatin America in order to specifically register the occurrence of small-and medium-scale disasters, and which has registered tens and tens ofthousands of these during the last 30 years in the 29 countries it coversto date. This database has been used by the UNISDR, the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, and others to examine disaster occurrence, scale,and impacts in Latin America and Asia, in particular (Cardona 2005,2008; IDEA, 2005; UNISDR, 2009e, 2011; ERN-AL, 2011). In any oneplace, the range of disaster-inducing events can increase if socialconditions deteriorate (Wisner et al., 2004, 2011). 
The occurrence of disaster is always preceded by the existence of
specific physical and social conditions that are generally referred toas disaster risk (Hewitt, 1983; Lewis, 1999, 2009; Bankoff, 2001;Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience

Figure 1-1 | The key concepts and scope of this report. The figure indicates schematically key concepts involved in disaster risk management  and climate change adaptation, and
the interaction of these with sustainable development.32Wisner et al., 2004, 2011; ICSU, 2008; UNISDR, 2009e, 2011; ICSU-LAC,
2009). 
Disaster risk is defined for the purposes of this study as the likelihood
over a specified time period of severe alterations in the normalfunctioning of a community or a society due to hazardous physicalevents interacting with vulnerable social conditions, leading towidespread adverse human, material, economic, or environmentaleffects that require immediate emergency response to satisfy criticalhuman needs and that may require external support for recovery.Disaster risk derives from a combination of physical hazards and thevulnerabilities of exposed elements and will signify the potential forsevere interruption of the normal functioning of the affected society onceit materializes as disaster. This qualitative statement will be expressedformally later in this assessment (Section 1.3 and Chapter 2). 
The definitions of disaster risk and disaster posited above do not include
the potential or actual impacts of climate and hydrological events onecosystems or the physical Earth system per se. In this assessment, suchimpacts are considered relevant to disaster if, as is often the case, theycomprise one or more of the following, at times interrelated, situations:i) they impact livelihoods negatively by seriously affecting ecosystemservices and the natural resource base of communities; ii) they haveconsequences for food security; and/or iii) they have impacts on humanhealth.
Extreme impacts on the physical environment are addressed in Section
3.5 and extreme impacts on ecosystems are considered in detail inChapter 4. In excluding such impacts from the definition of ‘disaster’ asemployed here, this chapter is in no way underestimating their broadersignificance (e.g., in regard to existence value) or suggesting theyshould not be dealt with under the rubric of adaptation concerns andmanagement needs. Rather, we are establishing their relative positionwithin the conceptual framework of climate-related, socially-defined‘disaster’ and ‘disaster risk’ and the management options that areavailable for promoting disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climatechange (see Section 1.1.2.2 and the Glossary for definitions of theseterms). Thus this report draws a distinction between ‘social disaster,’
where extreme impacts on the physical and ecological systems may or
may not play a part, and so-called ‘environmental disaster,’ where directphysical impacts of human activity and natural physical processes onthe environment are fundamental causes (with possible direct feedback
impacts on social systems). 
Disaster risk cannot exist without the threat of potentially damaging
physical events. However, such events, once they occur, are not in and of
themselves sufficient to explain disaster or its magnitude. In the searchto better understand the concept of disaster risk (thus disaster) it is
important to consider the notions of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure.
When extreme and non-extreme physical events, such as tropical
cyclones, floods, and drought, can affect elements of human systems inan adverse manner, they assume the characteristic of a hazard. Hazardis defined here as the potential occurrence of a natural or human-
induced physical event that may cause loss of life, injury, or otherhealth impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure,livelihoods, service provision, and environmental resources. Physicalevents become hazards where social elements (or environmentalresources that support human welfare and security) are exposed totheir potentially adverse impacts and exist under conditions that couldpredispose them to such effects. Thus, hazard is used in this study todenote a threat or potential for adverse effects, not the physical eventitself (Cardona, 1986, 1996, 2011; Smith, 1996; Tobin and Montz, 1997;Lavell, 2003; Hewitt, 2007; Wisner et al., 2004). 
Exposure is employed to refer to the presence (location) of people,
livelihoods, environmental services and resources, infrastructure, oreconomic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adverselyaffected by physical events and which, thereby, are subject to potentialfuture harm, loss, or damage. This definition subsumes physical andbiological systems under the concept of ‘environmental services andresources,’ accepting that these are fundamental for human welfare andsecurity (Crichton, 1999; Gasper, 2010). 
Exposure may also be dictated by mediating social structures (e.g.,
economic and regulatory) and institutions (Sen, 1983). For example,food insecurity may result from global market changes driven bydrought or flood impacts on crop production in another location. Otherrelevant and important interpretations and uses of exposure arediscussed in Chapter 2.
Under exposed conditions, the levels and types of adverse impacts will
be the result of a physical event (or events) interacting with sociallyconstructed conditions denoted as vulnerability. 
Vulnerability is defined generically in this report as the propensity or
predisposition to be adversely affected. Such predisposition constitutesan internal characteristic of the affected element. In the field of disasterrisk, this includes the characteristics of a person or group and theirsituation that influences their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist, andrecover from the adverse effects of physical events (Wisner et al., 2004). 
Vulnerability is a result of diverse historical, social, economic, political,
cultural, institutional, natural resource, and environmental conditionsand processes. 
The concept has been developed as a theme in disaster work since the
1970s (Baird et al., 1975; O’Keefe et al., 1976; Wisner et al., 1977; Lewis,1979, 1984, 1999, 2009; Timmerman, 1981; Hewitt, 1983, 1997, 2007;Cutter, 1996; Weichselgartner, 2001; Cannon, 2006; Gaillard, 2010) andvariously modified in different fields and applications in the interim(Adger, 2006; Eakin and Luers, 2006; Füssel, 2007). Vulnerability hasbeen evaluated according to a variety of quantitative and qualitativemetrics (Coburn and Spence, 2002; Schneider et al., 2007; Cardona,2011). A detailed discussion of this notion and the drivers or rootcauses of vulnerability are provided in Chapter 2.
Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience33The importance of vulnerability to the disaster risk management
community may be appreciated in the way it has helped to highlight therole of social factors in the constitution of risk, moving away from purelyphysical explanations and attributions of loss and damage (see Hewitt,1983 for an early critique of what he denominated the ‘physicalist’interpretation of disaster). Differential levels of vulnerability will leadto differential levels of damage and loss under similar conditions ofexposure to physical events of a given magnitude (Dow, 1992; Wisneret al., 2011). 
The fundamentally social connotation and ‘predictive’ value of
vulnerability is emphasized in the definition used here. The earlierIPCC definition of vulnerability refers, however, to “the degree to whicha system is susceptible to and unable to cope with adverse effects ofclimate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerabilityis a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change andvariation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptivecapacity” (IPCC, 2007c, p. 883). This definition makes physical causes andtheir effects an explicit aspect of vulnerability while the social contextis encompassed by the notions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity(these notions are defined later). In the definition used in this report, thesocial context is emphasized explicitly, and vulnerability is consideredindependent of physical events (Hewitt, 1983, 1997, 2007;Weichselgartner, 2001; Cannon, 2006; O’Brien et al., 2007).
Vulnerability has been contrasted and complimented with the notion of
capacity . 
Capacity refers to the combination of all the strengths, attributes, and
resources available to an individual, community, society, or organizationthat can be used to achieve established goals. This includes the conditionsand characteristics that permit society at large (institutions, local groups,individuals, etc.) access to and use of social, economic, psychological,cultural, and livelihood-related natural resources, as well as access tothe information and the institutions of governance necessary to reduce
vulnerability and deal with the consequences of disaster. This definitionextends the definition of capabilities referred to in Sen’s ‘capabilitiesapproach to development’ (Sen, 1983). 
The lack of capacity may be seen as being one dimension of overall
vulnerability, while it is also seen as a separate notion that, althoughcontributing to an increase in vulnerability, is not part of vulnerabilityper se. The existence of vulnerability does not mean an absolute, butrather a relative lack of capacity. 
Promoted in disaster recovery work by Anderson and Woodrow (1989)
as a means, among other objectives, to shift the analytical balance fromthe negative aspects of vulnerability to the positive actions by people,
the notion of capacity is fundamental to imagining and designing a
conceptual shift favoring disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climatechange. Effective capacity building , the notion of stimulating and
providing for growth in capacity ,requires a clear image of the future
with clearly established goals. 
Adaptive capacity comprises a specific usage of the notion of capacity
and is dealt with in detail in later sections of this chapter and Chapters2 and 8 in particular.
The existence of vulnerability and capacity and their importance for
understanding the nature and extent of the adverse effects that mayoccur with the impact of physical events can be complemented with aconsideration of the characteristics or conditions that help ameliorate ormitigate negative impacts once disaster materializes. The notions ofresilience and coping are fundamental in this sense.
Coping (elaborated upon in detail in Section 1.4 and Chapter 2) is
defined here generically as the use of available skills, resources, andopportunities to address, manage, and overcome adverse conditionsChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
FAQ 1.1 | Is there a one-to-one relationship between extreme events and disasters?
No. Disaster entails social, economic, or environmental impacts that severely disrupt the normal functioning of affected commun ities.
Extreme weather and climate events will lead to disaster if: 1) communities are exposed to those events; and 2) exposure to pot entially
damaging extreme events is accompanied by a high level of vulnerability (a predisposition for loss and damage). On the other ha nd,
disasters are also triggered by events that are not extreme in a statistical sense. High exposure and vulnerability levels will  transform
even some small-scale events into disasters for some affected communities. Recurrent small- or medium-scale events affecting th e same
communities may lead to serious erosion of its development base and livelihood options, thus increasing vulnerability. The timi ng (when
they occur during the day, month, or year) and sequence (similar events in succession or different events contemporaneously) of  such
events is often critical to their human impact. The relative importance of the underlying physical and social determinants of d isaster risk
varies with the scale of the event and the levels of exposure and vulnerability. Because the impact of lesser events is exacerb ated by
physical, ecological, and social conditions that increase exposure and vulnerability, these events disproportionately affect re source-poor
communities with little access to alternatives for reducing hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The potential negative consequ ences of
extreme events can be moderated in important ways (but rarely eliminated completely) by implementing corrective disaster risk
management strategies that are reactive, adaptive, and anticipatory, and by sustainable development.34with the aim of achieving basic functioning in the short to medium
terms.
Resilience is defined as the ability of a system and its component parts
to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of apotentially hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner, includingthrough ensuring the preservation, restoration, or improvement of itsessential basic structures and functions. As Gaillard (2010) points out,this term has been used in disaster studies since the 1970s (Torry, 1979)and has its origins in engineering (Gordon, 1978), ecology (Holling,1973) and child psychology (Werner et al., 1971). 
Although now widely employed in the fields of disaster risk management
and adaptation, resilience has been subject to a wide range ofinterpretations and levels of acceptance as a concept (Timmerman,1981; Adger, 2000; Klein et al., 2003; Berkes et al., 2004; Fol ke, 2006;
Gallopín, 2006; Manyena, 2006; Brand and Jax, 2007; Gaillard 2007;Bosher, 2008; Cutter et al., 2008; Kelman, 2008; Lewis and Kelman,2009; Bahadur et al., 2010; Aven, 2011). Thus, for example, the term isused by some in reference to situations at any point along the risk‘cycle’ or ‘continuum’, that is, before, during, or after the impact of thephysical event. And, in a different vein, some consider the notions of‘vulnerability’ and ‘capacity’ as being sufficient for explaining the rangesof success or failure that are found in different recovery scenarios andare thus averse to the use of the term at all (Wisner et al., 2004, 2011).Under this latter formulation, vulnerability both potentiates original lossand damage and also impedes recovery, while capacity building canchange this adverse balance and contribute to greater sustainabilityand reduced disaster risk. 
Older conceptions of resilience, as ‘bouncing back,’ and its conceptual
cousin, coping (see Section 1.4), have implicitly emphasized a return toa previous status quo or some other marginally acceptable level, suchas ‘surviving,’ as opposed to generating a cyclical process that leadsto continually improving conditions, as in ‘bouncing forward’ and/oreventually ‘thriving’ (Davies, 1993; Manyena, 2006). However, thedynamic and often uncertain consequences of climate change (as well asongoing, now longstanding, development trends such as urbanization)
for hazard and vulnerability profiles underscore the fact that ‘bouncing
back’ is an increasingly insufficient goal for disaster risk management
(Pelling, 2003; Vale and Campanella, 2005; Pendalla et al., 2010)(high confidence ). Recent conceptions of resilience of social-ecological
systems focus more on process than outcomes (e.g., Norris et al., 2008),
including the ability to self-organize, learn, and adapt over time (seeChapter 8). Some definitions of resilience, such as that used in this
report, now also include the idea of anticipation and ‘improvement’ of
essential basic structures and functions. Section 1.4 examines the
importance of learning that is emphasized within this more forward-
looking application of resilience. Chapter 8 builds on the importance of
learning by drawing also from literature that has explored the scope forinnovation, leadership, and adaptive management. Together thesestrategies offer potential pathways for transforming existing developmentvisions, goals, and practices into more sustainable and resilient futures.Chapters 2 and 8 address the notion of resilience and its importance in
discussions on sustainability, disaster risk reduction, and adaptation ingreater detail.
1.1.2.2. Concepts and Definitions Relating to Disaster Risk
Management and Adaptation to Climate Change
Disaster risk management is defined in this report as the processes
for designing, implementing, and evaluating strategies, policies, andmeasures to improve the understanding of disaster risk, foster disasterrisk reduction and  transfer, and promote continuous improvement in
disaster preparedness, response, and recovery practices, with the explicit
purpose of increasing human security, well-being, quality of life,  andsustainable development. 
Disaster risk management is concerned with both disaster and disaster
risk of differing levels and intensities. In other words, it is not restrictedto a ‘manual’ for the management of the risk or disasters associated withextreme events, but rather includes the conceptual framework thatdescribes and anticipates intervention in the overall and diverse patterns,scales, and levels of interaction of exposure, hazard, and vulnerabilitythat can lead to disaster. A major recent concern of disaster riskmanagement has been that disasters are associated more and more withlesser-scale physical phenomena that are not extreme in a physical sense
(see Section 1.1.1). This is principally attributed to increases in exposureand associated vulnerability (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). 
Where the term risk management is employed in this chapter and
report, it should be interpreted as being a synonym for disaster riskmanagement, unless otherwise made explicit.
Disaster Risk Management can be divided to comprise two related but
discrete subareas or components: disaster risk reduction and disaster
management . 
Disaster risk reduction denotes both a policy goal or objective, and
the strategic and instrumental measures employed for anticipatingfuture disaster risk, reducing existing exposure, hazard, or vulnerability,and improving resilience. This includes lessening the vulnerability ofpeople, livelihoods, and assets and ensuring the appropriate sustainablemanagement of land, water, and other components of the environment.Emphasis is on universal concepts and strategies involved in theconsideration of reducing disaster risks, including actions and activitiesenacted pre-impact, and when recovery and reconstruction call forthe anticipation of new disaster risk scenarios or conditions. A strongrelationship between disaster risk and disaster risk reduction, anddevelopment and development planning has been established andvalidated, particularly, but not exclusively, in developing countrycontexts (UNEP , 1972; Cuny, 1983; Sen, 1983; Hagman, 1984; Wijkmanand Timberla ke, 1988; Lavell, 1999, 2003, 2009; Wisner et al., 2004,
2011; UNDP , 2004; van Niekerk, 2007; Dulal et al., 2009; UNISDR,2009e, 2011) ( high confidence ).Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience35Disaster management refers to social processes for designing,
implementing, and evaluating strategies, policies, and measuresthat promote and improve disaster preparedness, response, and recoverypractices at different organizational  and societal levels. Disastermanagement processes are enacted once the immediacy of the disasterevent has become evident and resources and capacities are put in placewith which to respond prior to and following impact. These include theactivation of early warning systems, contingency planning, emergencyresponse (immediate post-impact support to satisfy critical humanneeds under conditions of severe stress), and, eventually, recovery(Alexander, 2000; Wisner et al., 2011). Disaster management is requireddue to the existence of ‘residual’ disaster risk that ongoing disasterrisk reduction processes have not mitigated or reduced sufficiently oreliminated or prevented completely (IDB, 2007). 
Growing disaster losses have led to rapidly increasing concerns for post-
impact financing of response and recovery (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). In thiscontext, the concept and practice of disaster risk transfer has receivedincreased interest and achieved greater salience. Risk transfer refers to
the process of formally or informally shifting the financial consequencesof particular risks from one party to another, whereby a household,community, enterprise, or state authority will obtain resources fromthe other party after a disaster occurs, in exchange for ongoing orcompensatory social or financial benefits provided to that other party.Disaster risk transfer mechanisms comprise a component of both disastermanagement and disaster risk reduction. In the former case, financialprovision is made to face up to the impacts and consequences of disasteronce this materializes. In the latter case, the adequate use of insurancepremiums, for example, can promote and encourage the use of disasterrisk reduction measures in the insured elements. Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 9discuss risk transfer in some detail.
Over the last two decades, the more integral notion of disaster risk
management and its risk reduction and disaster management components
has tended to replace the unique conception and terminology of ‘disasterand emergency management’ that prevailed almost unilaterally up tothe beginning of the 1990s and that emphasized disaster as opposed todisaster risk as the central issue to be confronted. Disaster as such
ordered the thinking on required intervention processes, whereas with
disaster risk management, disaster risk now tends to assume anincreasingly dominant position in thought and action in this field (see
Hewitt, 1983; Blaikie et al., 1994; Smith, 1996; Hewitt, 1997; Tobin andMontz, 1997; Lavell, 2003; Wisner et al., 2004, 2011; van Niekerk, 2007;Gaillard, 2010 for background and review of some of the historical
changes in favor of disaster risk management).
The notion of disaster or disaster management cycle was introduced
and popularized in the earlier context dominated by disaster or emergencymanagement concerns and viewpoints. The cycle, and the later ‘disaster
continuum’ notion, depicted the sequences and components of so-called
disaster management. In addition to considering preparedness, emergencyresponse, rehabilitation, and reconstruction, it also included disaster
prevention and mitigation as stated components of ‘disaster management’and utilized the temporal notions of before, during, and after disaster to
classify the different types of action (Lavell and Franco, 1996; vanNiekerk, 2007).
The cycle notion, criticized for its mechanistic depiction of the intervention
process, for insufficient consideration of the ways different componentsand actions merge and can act synergistically with and influence eachother, and for its incorporation of disaster risk reduction considerationsunder the rubric of ‘disaster management’ (Lavell and Franco, 1996;Lewis, 1999; Wisner et al., 2004; Balamir, 2005; van Niekerk, 2007), hastended to give way over time, in many parts of the world, to the morecomprehensive approach and concept of disaster risk management withits consideration of distinct risk reduction and disaster interventioncomponents. The move toward a conception oriented in terms of disasterrisk and not disaster per se has led to initiatives to develop the notionof a ‘ disaster risk continuum ’ whereby risk is seen to evolve and
change constantly, requiring different modalities of intervention overtime, from pre-impact risk reduction through response to new riskconditions following disaster impacts and the need for control of newrisk factors in reconstruction (see Lavell, 2003).
With regard to the influence of actions taken at one stage of the ‘cycle’
on other stages, much has been written, for example, on how the formand method of response to disaster itself may affect future disaster riskreduction efforts. The fostering of active community involvement, theuse of existing local and community capacities and resources, andthe decentralization of decisionmaking to the local level in disasterpreparedness and response, among other factors, have been consideredcritical for also improving understanding of disaster risk and thedevelopment of future disaster risk reduction efforts (Anderson andWoodrow, 1989; Alexander, 2000; Lavell, 2003; Wisner et al., 2004)(high confidence ). And, the methods used for, and achievements with,
reconstruction clearly have important impacts on future disaster riskand on the future needs for preparedness and response.
In the following subsection, some of the major reasons that explain
the transition from disaster management, with its emphasis on disaster,
to disaster risk management, with its emphasis on disaster risk, arepresented as a background for an introduction to the links and optionsfor closer integration of the adaptation and disaster risk managementfields. 
The gradual evolution of policies that favor disaster risk reduction
objectives as a component of development planning procedures (asopposed to disaster management seen as a function of civil protection,civil defense, emergency services, and ministries of public works) hasinevitably placed the preexisting emergency or disaster-response-orientedinstitutional and organizational arrangements for disaster managementunder scrutiny. The prior dominance of response-based and infrastructureorganizations has been complemented with the increasing incorporationof economic and social sector and territorial development agencies ororganizations, as well as planning and finance ministries. Systemic, asopposed to single agency, approaches are now evolving in many places.
Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience36Synergy, collaboration, coordination, and development of multidisciplinary
and multiagency schemes are increasingly seen as positive attributes forguaranteeing implementation of disaster risk reduction and disaster riskmanagement in a sustainable development framework (see Lavell andFranco, 1996; Ramírez and Cardona, 1996; Wisner et al., 2004, 2011).Under these circumstances the notion of national disaster risk
management systems or structures has emerged strongly. Such
notions are discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
Adaptation to climate change , the second policy, strategic, and
instrumental aspect of importance for this Special Report, is a notionthat refers to both human and natural systems. Adaptation in humansystems is defined here as the process of adjustment to actual orexpected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploitbeneficial opportunities. In natural systems, it is defined as the processof adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention mayfacilitate adjustment to expected climate.
These definitions modify the IPCC (2007c) definition that generically
speaks of the “adjustment in natural and human systems in response toactual and expected climatic stimuli, such as to moderate harm orexploit beneficial opportunities.” The objective of the redefinition usedin this report is to avoid the implication present in the prior IPCCdefinition that natural systems can adjust to expected climate stimuli.At the same time, it accepts that some forms of human intervention mayprovide opportunities for supporting natural system adjustment tofuture climate stimuli that have been anticipated by humans.
Adaptation is a key aspect of the present report and is dealt with in
greater detail in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 and later chapters. The moreample introduction to disaster risk management offered above derivesfrom the particular perspective of the present report: that adaptation isa goal to be advanced and extreme event and disaster risk managementare methods for supporting and advancing that goal.
The notion of adaptation is counterposed to the notion of mitigation
in the climate change literature and practice. Mitigation there refers to
the reduction of the rate of climate change via the management of
its causal factors (the emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel
combustion, agriculture, land use changes, cement production, etc.)(IPCC, 2007c). However, in disaster risk reduction practice, ‘mitigation’refers to the amelioration of disaster risk through the reduction of existinghazards, exposure, or vulnerability, including the use of different disaster
preparedness measures.
Disaster preparedness measures, including early warning and the
development of contingency or emergency plans, may be considered a
component of, and a bridge between, disaster risk reduction and disastermanagement. Preparedness accepts the existence of residual, unmitigatedrisk, and attempts to aid society in eliminating certain of the adverse
effects that could be experienced once a physical event(s) occurs (for
example, by the evacuation of persons and livestock from exposed and
vulnerable circumstances). At the same time, it provides for betterresponse to adverse effects that do materialize (for example, by
planning for adequate shelter and potable water supplies for the affectedor destitute persons or food supplies for affected animal populations).
In order to accommodate the two differing definitions of mitigation, this
report presumes that mitigation is a substantive action that can be
applied in different contexts where attenuation of existing specifiedconditions is required. 
Disaster mitigation is used to refer to actions that attempt to limit
further adverse conditions once disaster has materialized. This refers tothe avoidance of what has sometimes been called the ‘second disaster’following the initial physical impacts (Alexander, 2000; Wisner et al.,2011). The ‘second disaster’ may be characterized, among other things,by adverse effects on health (Noji, 1997; Wisner et al., 2011) andlivelihoods due to inadequate disaster response and rehabilitation plans,inadequate enactment of existing plans, or unforeseen or unforeseeablecircumstances.
Disaster risk prevention and disaster prevention refer, in a strict sense,
to the elimination or avoidance of the underlying causes and conditionsthat lead to disaster, thus precluding the possibility of either disasterrisk or disaster materializing. The notion serves to concentrate attentionon the fact that disaster risk is manageable and its materialization ispreventable to an extent (which varies depending on the context).Prospective (proactive) disaster risk management and adaptation
can contribute in important ways to avoiding future, and not just reducingexisting, risk and disaster once they have become manifest, as is the casewith corrective orreactive management (Lavell, 2003; UNISDR, 2011). 
1.1.2.3. The Social Construction of Disaster Risk
The notions of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, disaster risk, capacity,
resilience, and coping, and their social origins and bases, as presentedabove, reflect an emerging understanding that disaster risk and disaster,while potentiated by an objective, physical condition, are fundamentallya ‘social construction,’ the result of social choice, social constraints, andsocietal action and inaction ( high confidence ). The notion of social
construction of risk implies that management can take into account thesocial variables involved and to the best of its ability work toward risk reduction, disaster management, or risk transfer through sociallysustainable decisions and concerted human action (ICSU-LAC, 2009).This of course does not mean that there are not risks that may be toogreat to reduce significantly through human intervention, or othersthat the very social construction process may in fact exacerbate (seeSections 1.3.1.2 and 1.4.3). But in contrast with, for example, manynatural physical events and their contribution to disaster risk, thecomponent of risk that is socially constructed is subject to interventionin favor of risk reduction.
The contribution of physical events to disaster risk is characterized by
statistical distributions in order to elucidate the options for risk reductionChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience37and adaptation (Section 1.2 and Chapter 3). But, the explicit recognition
of the political, economic, social, cultural, physical, and psychologicalelements or determinants of risk leads to a spectrum of potential outcomesof physical events, including those captured under the notion ofextreme impacts (Section 1.2 and Chapter 4). Accordingly, risk
assessment (see Section 1.3) using both quantitative and qualitative(social and psychological) measures is required to render a morecomplete description of risk and risk causation processes (Section 1.3;Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982; Cardona, 2004; Wisner et al., 2004; Weber,2006). Climate change may introduce a break with past environmentalsystem functioning so that forecasting physical events becomes lessdetermined by past trends. Under these conditions, the processes thatcause, and the established indicators of, human vulnerability need to bereconsidered in order for risk assessment to remain an effective tool.The essential nature and structure of the characteristics that typifyvulnerability can of course change without climate changing.
1.1.3. Framing the Relation between Adaptation to
Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management
Adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management both seek
to reduce factors and modify environmental and human contexts thatcontribute to climate-related risk, thus supporting and promotingsustainability in social and economic development. The promotion ofadequate preparedness for disaster is also a function of disaster riskmanagement and adaptation to climate change. And, both practices areseen to involve learning (see Section 1.4), having a corrective andprospective component dealing with existing and projected future risk.
However, the two practices have tended to follow independent paths of
advance and development and have on many occasions employeddifferent interpretations of concepts, methods, strategies, and institutionalframeworks to achieve their ends. These differences should clearly betaken into account in the search for achieving greater synergy betweenthem and will be examined in an introductory fashion in Section 1.3 andin greater detail in following chapters of this report.
Public policy and professional concepts of disaster and their approaches
to disaster and disaster risk management have undergone very significant
changes over the last 30 years, so that challenges that are now anexplicit focus of the adaptation field are very much part of current disasterrisk reduction as opposed to mainstream historical disaster managementconcerns (Lavell, 2010; Mercer, 2010).These changes have occurred underthe stimuli of changing concepts, multidisciplinary involvement, social
and economic demands, and impacts of disasters, as well as institutionalchanges reflected in international accords and policies such as the UNDeclaration of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
in the 1990s, the 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action, as well as the workof the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction since 2000.
Particularly in developing countries, this transition has been stimulated
by the documented relationship between disaster risk and ‘skewed’development processes (UNEP , 1972; Cuny, 1983; Sen, 1983; Hagman,
1984; Wijkman and Timberla ke, 1988; Lavell, 1999, 2003; UNDP , 2004;
Wisner et al., 2004, 2011; Dulal et al., 2009; UNISDR, 2009e, 2011).Significant differentiation in the distribution or allocation of gains fromdevelopment and thus in the incidence of chronic or everyday risk,which disproportionately affect poorer persons and families, is a majorcontributor to the more specific existence of disaster risk (Hewitt, 1983,1997; Wisner et al., 2004). Reductions in the rate of ecosystem servicesdepletion, improvements in urban land use and territorial organizationprocesses, the strengthening of rural livelihoods, and general and specificadvances in urban and rural governance are viewed as indispensable toachieving the composite agenda of poverty reduction, disaster riskreduction, and adaptation to climate change (UNISDR, 2009e, 2011)(high confidence ).
Climate change is at once a problem of development and also a symptom
of ‘skewed’ development. In this context, pathways toward resilienceinclude both incremental and transformational approaches to development(Chapter 8). Transformational strategies place emphasis on addressingrisk that stems from social structures as well as social behavior andhave a broader scope extending from disaster risk management intodevelopment goals, policy, and practice (Nelson et al., 2007). In thisway transformation builds on a legacy of progressive, socially informeddisaster risk research that has applied critical methods, including that ofHewitt (1983), Watts (1983), Maskrey (1989, 2011), Blaikie et al. (1994),and Wisner et al. (2004). 
However, while there is a longstanding awareness of the role of
development policy and practice in shaping disaster risk, advances inthe reduction of the underlying causes – the social, political, economic,and environmental drivers of disaster risk – remain insufficient toreduce hazard, exposure, and vulnerability in many regions (UNISDR,2009e, 2011) ( high confidence ).
The difficult transition to more comprehensive disaster risk management
raises challenges for the proper allocation of efforts among disaster riskreduction, risk transfer, and disaster management efforts. Countriesexhibit a wide range of acceptance or resistance to the various challengesof risk management as seen from a development perspective, due todifferential access to information and education, varying levels ofdebate and discussion, as well as contextual, ideological, institutional,and other related factors. The introduction of disaster risk reductionconcerns in established disaster response agencies may in some caseshave led to a downgrading of efforts to improve disaster response,diverting scarce resources in favor of risk reduction aspects (Alexander,2000; DFID, 2004, 2005; Twigg, 2004).
The increasing emphasis placed on considering disaster risk management
as a dimension of development, and thus of development planning, asopposed to strict post-impact disaster response efforts, has beenaccompanied by increasing emphasis and calls for proactive, prospective
disaster risk prevention as opposed to reactive, corrective disaster riskmitigation (Lavell, 2003, 2010; UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience38The more recent emergence of integrated disaster risk management
reflects a shift from the notion of disaster to the notion of disaster riskas a central concept and planning concern. Disaster risk managementplaces increased emphasis on comprehensive disaster risk reduction.This shifting emphasis to risk reduction can be seen in the increasingimportance placed on developing resistance to the potential impacts
of physical events at various social or territorial scales, and in differenttemporal dimensions (such as those required for corrective or prospectiverisk management), and to increasing the resilience of affected communities.Resistance refers to the ability to avoid suffering significant adverse
effects. 
Within this context, disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate
change are undoubtedly far closer practically than when emergency ordisaster management objectives dominated the discourse and practice. Thefact that many in the climate change and disaster fields have associateddisaster risk management principally with disaster preparedness andresponse, and not with disaster risk reduction per se, contributed to theview that the two practices are essentially different, if complementary(Lavell, 2010; Mercer, 2010). Once the developmental basis of adaptationto climate change and disaster risk management are considered, alongwith the role of vulnerability in the constitution of risk, the temporalscale of concerns, and the corrective as well as prospective nature ofdisaster risk reduction, the similarities between and options for mergingof concerns and practices increases commensurately.
Section 1.3 examines the current status of adaptation to climate
change, as a prelude to examining in more detail the barriers andoptions for greater integration of the two practices. The historical frameoffered in this subsection comprises an introduction to that discussion.
1.1.4. Framing the Processes of Disaster Risk
Management and Adaptation to Climate Change
In this section, we explore two of the key issues that should be considered
in attempting to establish the overlap or distinction between thephenomena and social processes that concern disaster risk managementon the one hand, and adaptation to climate change on the other, and
that influence their successful practice: 1) the degree to which the focus
is on extreme events (instead of a more inclusive approach that considersthe full continuum of physical events with potential for damage, the social
contexts in which they occur, and the potential for such events to generate‘extreme impacts’ or disasters); and 2) consideration of the appropriatesocial-territorial scale that should be examined (i.e., aggregations, see
Schneider et al., 2007) in order to foster a deeper understanding of the
causes and effects of the different actors and processes at work.
1.1.4.1. Exceptionality, Routine, and Everyday Life
Explanations of loss and damage resulting from extreme events thatfocus primarily or exclusively on the physical event have been referredto as ‘physicalist’ (Hewitt, 1983). By contrast, notions developed around
the continuum of normal, everyday-life risk factors through to a linkedconsideration of physical and social extremes have been defined as‘comprehensive,’ ‘integral,’ or ‘holistic’ insofar as they embrace the socialas well as physical aspects of disaster risk and take into consideration theevolution of experience over time (Cardona, 2001; ICSU-LAC, 2009). Thelatter perspective has been a major contributing factor in the developmentof the so-called ‘vulnerability paradigm’ as a basis for understandingdisaster (Timmerman, 1981; Hewitt, 1983, 1997; Wisner et al., 2004;Eakin and Luers, 2006; NRC, 2006). 
Additionally, attention to the role of small- and medium-scale disasters
(UNISDR, 2009e, 2011) highlights the need to deal integrally with theproblem of cumulative disaster loss and damage, looking across thedifferent scales of experience both in human and physical worlds,in order to advance the efficacy of disaster risk management andadaptation. The design of mechanisms and strategies based on thereduction and elimination of everyday or chronic risk factors (Sen, 1983;World Bank, 2001), as opposed to actions based solely on the‘exceptional’ or ‘extreme’ events, is one obvious corollary of thisapproach. The ability to deal with risk, crisis, and change is closelyrelated to an individual’s life experience with smaller-scale, moreregular physical and social occurrences (Maskrey, 1989, 2011; Lavell,2003; Wisner et al., 2004) ( high confidence ). These concepts point
toward the possibility of reducing vulnerability and increasing resilienceto climate-related disaster by broadly focusing on exposure, vulnerability,and socially-determined propensity or predisposition to adverse effectsacross a range of risks.
As illustrated in Box 1-1, many of the extreme impacts associated with
climate change, and their attendant additional risks and opportunities,will inevitably need to be understood and responded to principally atthe scale of the individual, the individual household, and the community,in the framework of localities and nations and their organizational andmanagement options, and in the context of the many other day-to-daychanges, including those of an economic, political, technological, andcultural nature. As this real example illustrates, everyday life, history, anda sequence of crises can affect attitudes and ways of approaching moreextreme or complex problems. In contrast, many agents and institutionsof disaster risk management and climate change adaptation activitiesnecessarily operate from a different perspective, given the still highlycentralized and hierarchical authority approaches found in many partsof the world today. 
Whereas disaster risk management has been modified based on the
experiences of the past 30 years or more, adaptation to anthropogenicclimate change is a more recent issue on most decisionmakers’ policyagendas and is not informed by such a long tradition of immediateexperience. However, human adaptation to prevailing climate variabilityand change, and climate and weather extremes in past centuries andmillennia, provides a wealth of experience from which the field ofadaptation to climate change, and individuals and governments, candraw.Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience39The ethnographic vignette in Box 1-1 suggests the way some individuals
may respond to climate change in the context of previous experience,illustrating both the possibility of drawing successfully on past experiencein adapting to climate variability, or, on the other hand, failing tocomprehend the nature of novel risks.
1.1.4.2. Territorial Scale, Disaster Risk, and Adaptation
Climate-related disaster risk is most adequately depicted, measured, andmonitored at the local or micro level (families, communities, individualbuildings or production units, etc.) where the actual interaction of hazardand vulnerability are worked out in situ (Hewitt, 1983, 1997; Lavell,
2003; Wisner et al., 2004; Cannon, 2006; Maskrey, 2011). At the sametime, it is accepted that disaster risk construction processes are notlimited to specifically local or micro processes but, rather, to diverse
environmental, economic, social, and ideological influences whose
sources are to be found at scales from the international through to the
national, sub-national and local, each potentially in constant flux (Lavell,
2002, 2003; Wisner et al., 2004, 2011).
Changing commodity prices in international trading markets and their
impacts on food security and the welfare of agricultural workers, decisionson location and cessation of agricultural production by international
corporations, deforestation in the upper reaches of river basins, and landuse changes in urban hinterlands are but a few of these ‘extra-territorial’influences on local risk. Moreover, disasters, once materialized, have rippleeffects that many times go well beyond the directly affected zones (Wisneret al., 2004; Chapter 5) Disaster risk management and adaptation policy,strategies, and institutions will only be successful where understandingand intervention is based on multi-territorial and social-scale principlesand where phenomena and actions at local, sub-national, national, andinternational scales are construed in interacting, concatenated ways(Lavell, 2002; UNISDR, 2009e, 2011; Chapters 5 through 9).
1.2. Extreme Events, Extreme Impacts,
and Disasters
1.2.1. Distinguishing Extreme Events,
Extreme Impacts, and Disasters
Both the disaster risk management and climate change adaptation
literature define ‘extreme weather’ and ‘extreme climate’ events anddiscuss their relationship with ‘extreme impacts’ and ‘disasters.’Classification of extreme events, extreme impacts, and disasters isinfluenced by the measured physical attributes of weather or climaticvariables (see Section 3.1.2) or the vulnerability of social systems (seeSection 2.4.1).
This section explores the quantitative definitions of different classes of
extreme weather events, what characteristics determine that an impactis extreme, and how climate change affects the understanding ofextreme climate events and impacts.Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
Box 1-1 | One Person’s Experience with Climate Variability in the Context of Other Changes
Joseph is 80 years old. He and his father and his grandfather have witnessed many changes. Their homes have shifted back and fo rth
from the steep slopes of the South Pare Mountains at 1,500 m to the plains 20 km away, near the Pangani River at 600 m, in Tanz ania.
What do ‘changes’ (mabadiliko) mean to someone whose father saw the Germans and British fight during the First World War andwhose grandfather defended against Maasai cattle raids when Victoria was still Queen?
Joseph outlived the British time. He saw African Socialism come and go after Independence. A road was constructed parallel to t he old
German rail line. Successions of commercial crops were dominant during his long life, some grown in the lowlands on plantations  (sisal,
kapok, and sugar), and some in the mountains (coffee, cardamom, ginger). He has seen staple foods change as maize became morepopular than cassava and bananas. Land cover has also changed. Forest retreated, but new trees were grown on farms. Pasture gra sses
changed as the government banned seasonal burning. The Pangani River was dammed, and the electricity company decides how muchwater people can take for irrigation. Hospitals and schools have been built. Insecticide-treated bed nets recently arrived for the children
and pregnant mothers.
Joseph has nine plots of land at different altitudes spanning the distance from mountain to plain, and he keeps in touch with h is children
who work them by mobile phone. What is ‘climate change’ (mabadiliko ya tabia nchi) to Joseph? He has suffered and benefited fro m
many changes. He has lived through many droughts with periods of hunger, witnessed floods, and also seen landslides in the moun tains.
He is skilled at seizing opportunities from changes – small and large: “Mabadiliko bora kuliko mapumziko” (Change is better tha n resting).
The provenance of this story is an original field work interview undertaken by Ben Wisner in November 2009 in Same District, Ki limanjaro
Region, Tanzania in the context of the U.S. National Science Foundation-funded research project “Linking Local Knowledge and Lo cal
Institutions for the Study of Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change: Participatory GIS in Northern Tanzania.”401.2.2. Extreme Events Defined in Physical Terms
1.2.2.1. Definitions of Extremes
Some literature reserve the term ‘extreme event’ for initial meteorological
phenomena (Easterling et al., 2000; Jentsch et al., 2007), some includethe consequential physical impacts, like flooding (Young, 2002), and somethe entire spectrum of outcomes for humans, society, and ecosystems
(Rich et al., 2008). In this report, we use ‘extreme (weather or climate)event’ to refer solely to the initial and consequent physical phenomena
including some (e.g., flooding) that may have human components tocausation other than that related to the climate (e.g., land use or landcover change or changes in water management; see Section 3.1.2 andGlossary). The spectrum of outcomes for humans, society, and physicalsystems, including ecosystems, are considered ‘impacts’ rather than partof the definition of ‘events’ (see Sections 1.1.2.1 and 3.1.2 and theGlossary).
In addition to providing a long-term mean of weather, ‘climate’
characterizes the full spectrum of means and exceptionality associatedwith ‘unusual’ and unusually persistent weather. The World MeteorologicalOrganization (WMO, 2010) differentiates the terms in the following way(see also FAQ 6.1): “ At the simplest level the weather is what is happeningto the atmosphere at any given time. Climate in a narrow sense isusually defined as the ‘average weather,’ or more rigorously, as thestatistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevantquantities over a period of tim e.” 
Weather and climate phenomena reflect the interaction of dynamic and
thermodynamic processes over a very wide range of space and temporalscales. This complexity results in highly variable atmospheric conditions,including temperatures, motions, and precipitation, a component ofwhich is referred to as ‘extreme events.’ Extreme events include thepassage of an intense tornado lasting minutes and the persistence ofdrought conditions over decades – a span of at least seven orders ofmagnitude of timescales. An imprecise distinction between extreme‘weather’ and ‘climate’ events, based on their characteristic timescales,is drawn in Section 3.1.2. Similarly, the spatial scale of extreme climateor weather varies from local to continental.
Where there is sufficient long-term recorded data to develop a statistical
distribution of a key weather or climate variable, it is possible to find theprobability of experiencing a value above or below different thresholds
of that distribution as is required in engineering design (trends may be
sought in such data to see if there is evidence that the climate has notbeen stationary over the sample period; Milly et al., 2008). The extremity
of a weather or climate event of a given magnitude depends on
geographic context (see Section 3.1.2 and Box 3-1): a month of dailytemperatures corresponding to the expected spring climatological dailymaximum in Chennai, India, would be termed a heat wave in France; a
snow storm expected every year in New York, USA, might initiate a
disaster when it occurs in southern China. Furthermore, according to thelocation and social context, a 1-in-10 or 1-in-20 annual probabilityevent may not be sufficient to result in unusual consequences.
Nonetheless, universal thresholds can exist – for example, a reductionin the incidence or intensity of freezing days may allow certain diseasevectors to thrive (e.g., Epstein et al., 1998). These various aspects areconsidered in the definition of ‘extreme (weather and climate) events.’
The availability of observational data is of central relevance for defining
climate characteristics and for disaster risk management; and, while datafor temperature and precipitation are widely available, some associatedvariables, such as soil moisture, are poorly monitored, or, like extremewind speeds and other low frequency occurrences, not monitored withsufficient spatial resolution or temporal continuity (Section 3.2.1).
1.2.2.2. Extremes in a Changing Climate
An extreme event in the present climate may become more common, ormore rare, under future climate conditions. When the overall distributionof the climate variable changes, what happens to mean climate maybe different from what happens to the extremes at either end of thedistribution (see Figure 1-2). 
For example, a warmer mean climate could result from fewer cold days,
leading to a reduction in the variance of temperatures, or more hot days,leading to an expansion in the variance of the temperature distribution,or both. The issue of the scaling of changes in extreme events with respectto changes in mean temperatures is addressed further in Section 3.1.6.
In general, single extreme events cannot be simply and directly attributed
to anthropogenic climate change, as there is always a possibility the
event in question might have occurred without this contribution (Hegerlet al., 2007; Section 3.2.2; FAQ 3.2). However, for certain classes ofregional, long-duration extremes (of heat and rainfall) it has provedpossible to argue from climate model outputs that the probability ofsuch an extreme has changed due to anthropogenic climate forcing(Stott et al., 2004; Pall et al., 2011). 
Extremes sometimes result from the interactions between two unrelated
geophysical phenomena such as a moderate storm surge coincidingwith an extreme spring tide, as in the most catastrophic UK storm surgeflood of the past 500 years in 1607 (Horsburgh and Horritt, 2006).Climate change may alter both the frequency of extreme surges andcause gradual sea level rise, compounding such future extreme floods(see Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.5).
1.2.2.3. The Diversity and Range of Extremes
The specification of weather and climate extremes relevant to theconcerns of individuals, communities, and governments depends on theaffected stakeholder, whether in agriculture, disease control, urbandesign, infrastructure maintenance, etc. Accordingly, the range of suchextremes is very diverse and varies widely. For example, whether it fallsChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience41as rain, freezing rain (rain falling through a surface layer below freezing),
snow, or hail, extreme precipitation can cause significant damage(Peters et al., 2001). The absence of precipitation (McKee et al., 1993) aswell as excess evapotranspiration from the soil (see Box 3-3) can beclimate extremes, and lead to drought. Extreme surface winds arechiefly associated with structured storm circulations (Emanuel, 2003;Zipser et al., 2006; Leckebusch et al., 2008). Each storm type, includingthe most damaging tropical cyclones and mid-latitude extratropicalcyclones, as well as intense convective thunderstorms, presents aspectrum of size, forward speed, and intensity. A single intense stormcan combine extreme wind and extreme rainfall. The prolonged absence of winds is a climate extreme that can also be a
hazard, leading to the accumulation of urban pollution and disruptivefog (McBean, 2006).
The behavior of the atmosphere is also highly interlinked with that of
the hydrosphere, cryosphere, and terrestrial environment so that extreme(or sometimes non-extreme) atmospheric events may cause (or contributeto) other rare physical events. Among the more widely documentedhydroclimatic extremes are:
•Large cyclonic storms that generate wind and pressure anomaliescausing coastal flooding and severe wave action (Xie et al., 2004). 
•Floods, reflecting river flows in excess of the capacity of the normalchannel, often influenced by human intervention and watermanagement, resulting from intense precipitation; rapid thaw ofaccumulated winter snowfall; rain falling on previous snowfall (Sui
and Koehler, 2001); or an outburst from an ice, landslide, moraine,
or artificially dammed lake (de Jong et al., 2005). According to thescale of the catchment, river systems have characteristic responsetimes with steep short mountain streams, desert wadis, and urbandrainage systems responding to rainfall totals over a few hours, whilepeak flows in major continental rivers reflect regional precipitationextremes lasting weeks (Wheater, 2002).
•Long-term reductions in precipitation, or dwindling of residualsummer snow and ice melt (Rees and Collins, 2006), or increasedevapotranspiration from higher temperatures, often exacerbatedby human groundwater extraction, reducing ground water levelsand causing spring-fed rivers to disappear (Konikow and Kendy,2005), and contributing to drought.
•Landslides (Dhakal and Sidle, 2004) when triggered by raisedgroundwater levels after excess rainfall or active layer detachmentsin thawing slopes of permafrost (Lewcowicz and Harris, 2005). 
1.2.3. Extreme Impacts
1.2.3.1. Three Classes of Impacts
In this subsection we consider three classes of ‘impacts’: 1) changes in
the natural physical environment, like beach erosion from storms andmudslides; 2) changes in ecosystems, such as the blow-down of forestsin hurricanes, and 3) adverse effects (according to a variety of metrics)on human or societal conditions and assets. However, impacts are notalways negative: flood-inducing rains can have beneficial effects on thefollowing season’s crops (Khan, 2011), while an intense freeze mayreduce insect pests at the subsequent year’s harvest (Butts et al., 1997).
An extreme impact reflects highly significant and typically long-lasting
consequences to society, the natural physical environment, or ecosystems.Extreme impacts can be the result of a single extreme event, successiveextreme or non-extreme events, including non-climatic events (e.g.,wildfire, followed by heavy rain leading to landslides and soil erosion),or simply the persistence of conditions, such as those that lead todrought (see Sections 3.5.1 and 9.2.3 for discussion and examples).Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience

Figure 1-2 | The effect of changes in temperature distribution on extremes. Different
changes in temperature distributions between present and future climate and their
effects on extreme values of the distributions: a) effects of a simple shift of the entire
distribution toward a warmer climate; b) effects of an increased temperature variability
with no shift of the mean; and c) effects of an altered shape of the distribution, in this
example an increased asymmetry toward the hotter part of the distribution.42Whether an extreme event results in extreme impacts on humans and
social systems depends on the degree of exposure and vulnerability tothat extreme, in addition to the magnitude of the physical event ( high
confidence ). Extreme impacts on human systems may be associated
with non-extreme events where vulnerability and exposure are high(Sections 1.1.2.1 and 9.2.3). A key weather parameter may cross some
critical value at that location (such as that associated with heat wave-induced mortality, or frost damage to crops), so that the distribution ofthe impact shifts in a way that is disproportionate to physical changes(see Section 4.2). A comprehensive assessment of projected impacts ofclimate changes would consider how changes in atmospheric conditions(temperature, precipitation) translate to impacts on physical (e.g.,droughts and floods, erosion of beaches and slopes, sea level rise),ecological (e.g., forest fires), and human systems (e.g., casualties,infrastructure damages). For example, an extreme event with a largespatial scale (as in an ice storm or windstorm) can have an exaggerated,disruptive impact due to the systemic societal dependence on electricitytransmission and distribution networks (Peters et al., 2006). Links betweenclimate events and physical impacts are addressed in Section 3.5, while
links to ecosystems and human systems impacts are addressed in 4.3.
Disaster signifies extreme impacts suffered by society, which may also
be associated with extreme impacts on the physical environment andon ecosystems. Building on the definition set out in Section 1.1.2.1,extreme impacts resulting from weather, climate, or hydrological eventscan become disasters once they surpass thresholds in at least one ofthree dimensions: spatial – so that damages cannot be easily restoredfrom neighboring capacity; temporal – so that recovery becomesfrustrated by further damages; and intensity of impact on the affectedpopulation – thereby undermining, although not necessarily eliminating,the capacity of the society or community to repair itself (Alexander,1993). However, for the purposes of tabulating occurrences, someagencies only list ‘disasters’ when they exceed certain numbers of killedor injured or total repair costs (Below et al., 2009; CRED, 2010).
1.2.3.2. Complex Nature of an Extreme ‘Event’
In considering the range of weather and climate extremes, along withtheir impacts, the term ‘event’ as used in the literature does not
adequately capture the compounding of outcomes from successive
physical phenomena, for example, a procession of serial storms tracking
across the same region (as in January and February 1990 and December1999 across Western Europe, Ulbrich et al., 2001). In focusing on the socialcontext of disasters, Quarantelli (1986) proposed the use of the notion of‘disaster occurrences or occasions’ in place of ‘events’ due to the abrupt
and circumstantial nature of the connotation commonly attributed tothe word ‘event,’ which belies the complexity and temporality of disaster,in particular because social context may precondition and extend the
duration over which impacts are felt. 
Sometimes locations affected by extremes within the ‘same’ large-scale
stable atmospheric circulation can be far apart, as for example theRussian heat wave and Indus valley floods in Pakistan in the summer of
2010 (Lau and Kim, 2011). Extreme events can also be interrelatedthrough the atmospheric teleconnections that characterize the principaldrivers of oceanic equatorial sea surface temperatures and winds in theEl Niño–Southern Oscillation. The relationship between modes of climatevariability and extremes is discussed in greater detail in Section 3.1.1.
The aftermath of one extreme event may precondition the physical
impact of successor events. High groundwater levels and river flows can
persist for months, increasing the probability of a later storm causingflooding, as on the Rhine in 1995 (Fink et al., 1996). A thickness reduction
in Arctic sea ice preconditions more extreme reductions in the summerice extent (Holland et al., 2006). A variety of feedbacks and otherinteractions connect extreme events and physical system and ecologicalresponses in a way that may amplify physical impacts (Sections 3.1.4and 4.3.5). For example, reductions in soil moisture can intensify heatwaves (Seneviratne et al., 2006), while droughts following rainy seasonsturn vegetation into fuel that can be consumed in wildfires (Westerlingand Swetman, 2003), which in turn promote soil runoff and landslideswhen the rains return (Cannon et al., 2001). However, extremes can alsointeract to reduce disaster risk. The wind-driven waves in a hurricanebring colder waters to the surface from beneath the thermocline; for thenext month, any cyclone whose path follows too closely will have areduced potential maximum intensity (Emanuel, 2001). Intense rainfallaccompanying monsoons and hurricanes also brings great benefits tosociety and ecosystems; on many occasions it helps to fill reservoirs,sustain seasonal agriculture, and alleviate summer dry conditions in aridzones (e.g., Cavazos et al., 2008).
1.2.3.3. Metrics to Quantify Social Impacts
and the Management of Extremes
Metrics to quantify social and economic impacts (thus used to define
extreme impacts) may include, among others (Below et al., 2009):
•Human casualties and injuries
•Number of permanently or temporarily displaced people
•Number of directly and indirectly affected persons 
•Impacts on properties, measured in terms of numbers of buildingsdamaged or destroyed
•Impacts on infrastructure and lifelines
•Impacts on ecosystem services
•Impacts on crops and agricultural systems
•Impacts on disease vectors
•Impacts on psychological well being and sense of security
•Financial or economic loss (including insurance loss)
•Impacts on coping capacity and need for external assistance.
All of these may be calibrated according to the magnitude, rate, duration,
and degree of irreversibility of the effects (Schneider et al., 2007).These metrics may be quantified and implemented in the context ofprobabilistic risk analysis in order to inform policies in a variety ofcontexts (see Box 1-2).Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience43Information on direct, indirect, and collateral impacts is generally
available for many large-scale disasters and is systematized and providedby organizations such as the Economic Commission for Latin America,
large reinsurers, and the EM-DAT database (CRED, 2010). Information
on impacts of smaller, more recurrent events is far less accessible and
more restricted in the number of robust variables it provides. TheDesinventar database (Corporación OSSO, 2010), now available for 29
countries worldwide, and the Spatial Hazard Events and LossesDatabase for the United States (SHELDUS; HVRI, 2010), are attempts tosatisfy this need. However, the lack of data on many impacts impedes
complete knowledge of the global social and economic impacts ofsmaller-scale disasters (UNISDR, 2009e).
1.2.3.4. Traditional Adjustment to Extremes
Disaster risk management and climate change adaptation may be seenas attempts to duplicate, promote, or improve upon adjustments thatChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
Box 1-2 | Probabilistic Risk Analysis
In its simplest form, probabilistic risk analysis defines risk as the product of the probability that some event (or sequence) will occur and
the adverse consequences of that event.
Risk = Probability x Consequence (1)
For instance, the risk a community faces from flooding from a nearby river might be calculated based on the likelihood that the  river floods
the town, inflicting casualties among inhabitants and disrupting the community’s economic livelihood. This likelihood is multip lied by the
value people place on those casualties and economic disruption. Equation (1) provides a quantitative representation of the qual itative
definition of disaster risk given in Section 1.1. All three factors – hazard, exposure, and vulnerability – contribute to ‘cons equences.’
Hazard and vulnerability can both contribute to the ‘probability’: the former to the likelihood of the physical event (e.g., th e river flooding
the town) and the latter to the likelihood of the consequence resulting from the event (e.g., casualties and economic disruptio n). 
When implemented within a broader risk governance framework, probabilistic risk analysis can help allocate and evaluate efforts  to
manage risk. Equation (1) implies what the decision sciences literature (Morgan and Henrion, 1990) calls a decision rule – that is, a
criterion for ranking alternative sets of actions by their ability to reduce overall risk. For instance, an insurance company ( as part of a risk
transfer effort) might set the annual price for flood insurance based on multiplying an estimate of the probability a dwelling would be
flooded in any given year by an estimate of the monetary losses such flooding would cause. Ideally, the premiums collected from  the
residents of many dwellings would provide funds to compensate the residents of those few dwellings that are in fact flooded (an d
defray administrative costs). In another example, a water management agency (as part of a risk reduction effort) might invest t he
resources to build a reservoir of sufficient size so that, if the largest drought observed in their region over the last 100 ye ars (or some
other timeframe) occurred again in the future, the agency would nonetheless be able to maintain a reliable supply of water.
A wide variety of different expressions of the concepts in Equation (1) exist in the literature. The disaster risk management c ommunity
often finds it convenient to express risk as a product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (e.g., UNISDR, 2009e, 2011). In a ddition, the
decision sciences literature recognizes decision rules, useful in some circumstances, that do not depend on probability and con sequence
as combined in Equation (1). For instance, if the estimates of probabilities are sufficiently imprecise, decisionmakers might u se a criterion
that depends only on comparing estimates of potential consequences (e.g., mini-max regret, Savage, 1972). 
In practice, probabilistic risk analysis is often not implemented in its pure form for reasons including data limitations; deci sion rules that
yield satisfactory results with less effort than that required by a full probabilistic risk assessment; the irreducible impreci sion of some
estimates of important probabilities and consequences (see Sections 1.3.1.1 and 1.3.2); and the need to address the wide range of factors
that affect judgments about risk (see Box 1-3). In the above example, the water management agency is not performing a full prob abilistic
risk analysis, but rather employing a hybrid decision rule in which it estimates that the consequences of running out of water would be
so large as to justify any reasonable investment needed to keep the likelihood of that event below the chosen probabilistic thr eshold.
Chapter 2 describes a variety of practical quantitative and qualitative approaches for allocating efforts to manage disaster ri sk. 
The probabilistic risk analysis framework in its pure form is nonetheless important because its conceptual simplicity aids unde rstanding
by making assumptions explicit, and because its solid theoretical foundations and the vast empirical evidence examining its app lication
in specific cases make it an important point of comparison for formal evaluations of the effectiveness of efforts to manage dis aster risk.44society and nature have accomplished on many occasions spontaneously
in the past, if over a different range of conditions than expected in thefuture.
Within the sphere of adaptation of natural systems to climate, among
trees, for example, natural selection has the potential to evolveappropriate resilience to extremes (at some cost). Resistance towindthrow is strongly species-dependent, having evolved according tothe climatology where that tree was indigenous (Canham et al., 2001).In their original habitat, trees typically withstand wind extremes expectedevery 10 to 50 years, but not extremes that lie beyond their averagelifespan of 100 to 500 years (Ostertag et al., 2005).
In human systems, communities traditionally accustomed to periodic
droughts employ wells, boreholes, pumps, dams, and water harvestingand irrigation systems. Those with houses exposed to high seasonaltemperatures employ thick walls and narrow streets, have developedpassive cooling systems, adapted lifestyles, or acquired air conditioning.In regions unaccustomed to heat waves, the absence of such systems,in particular in the houses of the most vulnerable elderly or sick,contributes to excess mortality, as in Paris, France, in August 2003(Vandentorren et al., 2004) or California in July 2006 (Gershunov et al.,2009). 
The examples given above of ‘spontaneous’ human system adjustment
can be contrasted with explicit measures that are taken to reduce riskfrom an expected range of extremes. On the island of Guam, withinthe most active and intense zone of tropical cyclone activity on Earth,
buildings are constructed to the most stringent wind design code in theworld. Buildings are required to withstand peak gust wind speeds of76 ms
-1, expected every few decades (International Building Codes,
2003). More generally, annual wind extremes for coastal locations willtypically be highest at mid-latitudes while those expected once everycentury will be highest in the 10° to 25° latitude tropics (Walshaw,2000). Consequently, indigenous building practices are less likely to beresilient close to the equator than in the windier (and storm surgeaffected) mid-latitudes (Minor, 1983).
While local experience provides a reservoir of knowledge from which
disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change are drawing(Fouillet et al., 2008), it may not be available to other regions yet to beaffected by such extremes. Thus, these experiences may not be drawn
upon to provide guidance if future extremes go outside the traditional
or recently observed range, as is expected for some extremes as theclimate changes (see Chapter 3).
1.3. Disaster Management, Disaster Risk
Reduction, and Risk Transfer
One important component of both disaster risk management and
adaptation to climate change is the appropriate allocation of efforts
among disaster management, disaster risk reduction, and risk transfer,as defined in Section 1.1.2.2. The current section provides a brief survey
of the risk governance framework for making judgments about such anallocation, suggests why climate change may complicate effectivemanagement of disaster risks, and identifies potential synergiesbetween disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change.
Disaster risks appear in the context of human choices that aim to satisfy
human wants and needs (e.g., where to live and in what types ofdwelling, what vehicles to use for transport, what crops to grow, whatinfrastructure to support economic activities, Hohenemser et al., 1984;Renn, 2008). Ideally, the choice of any portfolio of actions to addressdisaster risk would take into consideration human judgments aboutwhat constitutes risk, how to weigh such risk alongside other valuesand needs, and the social and economic contexts that determine whosejudgments influence individuals’ and societal responses to those risks. 
The risk governance framework offers a systematic way to help situate
such judgments about disaster management, risk reduction, and risktransfer within this broader context. Risk governance, under Renn’s(2008) formulation, consists of four phases – pre-assessment, appraisal,characterization/evaluation, and management – in an open, cyclical,iterative, and interlinked process. Risk communication accompanies allfour phases. This process is consistent with those in the UNISDR HyogoFramework for Action (UNISDR, 2005), the best known and adhered toframework for considering disaster risk management concerns (seeChapter 7).
As one component of its broader approach, risk governance uses
concepts from probabilistic risk analysis to help judge appropriateallocations in level of effort and over time and among risk reduction,risk transfer, and disaster management actions. The basic probabilisticrisk analytic framework for considering such allocations regards riskas the product of the probability of an event(s) multiplied by itsconsequence (see Box 1-2; Bedford and Coo ke, 2001). In this formulation,
risk reduction aims to reduce exposure and vulnerability as well as the
probability of occurrence of some events (e.g., those associated withlandslides and forest fires induced by human intervention). Risk transfer
efforts aim to compensate losses suffered by those who directly experiencean event. Disaster management aims to respond to the immediate
consequences and facilitate reduction of longer-term consequences (seeSection 1.1). 
Probabilistic risk analysis can help compare the efficacy of alternative
actions to manage risk and inform judgments about the appropriateallocation of resources to reduce risk. For instance, the frameworksuggests that equivalent levels of risk reduction result from reducing anevent’s probability or by reducing its consequences by equal percentages.Probabilistic risk analysis also suggests that a series of relatively smaller,more frequent events could pose the same risk as a single, relatively lessfrequent, larger event. Probabilistic risk analysis can help inform decisionsabout alternative allocations of risk management efforts by facilitatingthe comparison of the increase or decrease in risk resulting from thealternative allocations ( high confidence ). Since the costs of availableChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience45risk reduction, risk transfer, and disaster management actions will in
general differ, the framework can help inform judgments about aneffective mix of such actions in any particular case (see UNISDR, 2011,for efforts at stratifying different risk levels as a prelude to finding the
most adequate mix of disaster risk management actions).
Probabilistic risk analysis is, however, rarely implemented in its pure
form, in part because quantitative estimates of hazard and vulnerabilityare not always available and are not numbers that are independent of
the individuals making those estimates. Rather, these estimates are
determined by a combination of direct physical consequences of anevent and the interaction of psychological, social, institutional, and
cultural processes (see Box 1-3). For instance, perceptions of the risks of anuclear power plant may be influenced by individuals’ trust in the peopleoperating the plant and by views about potential linkages betweennuclear power and nuclear weapons proliferation – factors that may not
be considered in a formal risk assessment for any given plant. Given this
social construction of risk (see Section 1.1.2.2), effective allocations of
efforts among risk reduction, risk transfer, and disaster managementmay best emerge from an integrated risk governance process, which
includes the pre-assessment, appraisal, characterization/evaluation, andongoing communications elements. Disaster risk management andadaptation to climate change each represent approaches that alreadyuse or could be improved by the use of this risk governance process, butas described in Section 1.3.1, climate change poses a particular set ofadditional challenges.
Together, the implications of probabilistic risk analysis and the social
construction of risk reinforce the following considerations with regard tothe effective allocation and implementation of efforts to manage risksin both disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change:
•As noted in Section 1.1, vulnerability, exposure, and hazard areeach critical to determining disaster risk and the efficacy of actionstaken to manage that risk ( high confidence ).
•Effective disaster risk management will in general require a
portfolio of many types of risk reduction, risk transfer, and disastermanagement actions appropriately balanced in terms of resourcesapplied over time ( high confidence ).Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
Box 1-3 | Influence of Cognitive Processes, Culture, and Ideology on Judgments about Risk
A variety of cognitive, cultural, and social processes affect judgments about risk and about the allocation of efforts to addre ss these
risks. In addition to the processes described in Section 1.3.1.2, subjective judgments may be influenced more by emotional reac tions to
events (e.g., feelings of fear and loss of control) than by analytic assessments of their likelihood (Loewenstein et al., 2001).  People
frequently ignore predictions of extreme events if those predictions fail to elicit strong emotional reactions, but will also o verreact to
such forecasts when the events elicit feelings of fear or dread (Slovic et al., 1982; Slovic 1993, 2010; Weber, 2006). Even wit h sufficient
information, everyday concerns and satisfaction of basic wants may prove a more pressing concern than attention and effort towa rd
actions to address longer-term disaster risk (Maskrey, 1989, 2011; Wisner et al., 2004). 
In addition to being influenced by cognitive shortcuts (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), the perceptions of risk and extremes and r eactions
to such risk and events are also shaped by motivational processes (Weber, 2010). Cultural theory combines insights from anthrop ology
and political science to provide a conceptual framework and body of empirical studies that seek to explain societal conflict ov er risk
(Douglas, 1992). People’s worldview and political ideology guide attention toward events that threaten their desired social ord er
(Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982). Risk in this framework is defined as the disruption of a social equilibrium. Personal beliefs al so influence
which sources of expert forecasts of extreme climate events will be trusted. Different cultural groups put their trust into dif ferent
organizations, from national meteorological services to independent farm organizations to the IPCC; depending on their values, beliefs,
and corresponding mental models, people will be receptive to different types of interventions (Dunlap and McCright, 2008; Malka  and
Krosnick, 2009). Judgments about the veracity of information regarding the consequences of alternative actions often depend on the
perceived consistency of those actions with an individual’s cultural values, so that individuals will be more willing to consid er information
about consequences that can be addressed with actions seen as consistent with their values (Kahan and Braman, 2006; Kahan et al ., 2007). 
Factual information interacts with social, institutional, and cultural processes in ways that may amplify or attenuate public p erceptions of
risk and extreme events (Kasperson et al., 1988). The US public’s estimates of the risk of nuclear power following the accident at Three
Mile Island provide an example of the socio-cultural filtering of engineering safety data. Social amplification increased publi c perceptions
of the risk of nuclear power far beyond levels that would derive only from analysis of accident statistics (Fischhoff et al., 19 83). The public’s
transformation of expert-provided risk signals can serve as a corrective mechanism by which cultural subgroups of society augme nt a
science-based risk analysis with psychological risk dimensions not considered in technical risk assessments (Slovic, 2000). Evi dence from
health, social psychology, and risk communication literature suggests that social and cultural risk amplification processes mod ify
perceptions of risk in either direction and in ways that may generally be socially adaptive, but can also bias reactions in soc ially
undesirable ways in specific instances (APA, 2009). 46•Participatory and decentralized processes that are linked to higher
levels of territorial governance (regions, nation) are a crucial partof all the stages of risk governance that include identification,choice, and implementation of these actions ( high confidence ).
1.3.1. Climate Change Will Complicate
Management of Some Disaster Risks
Climate change will pose added challenges in many cases for attaining
disaster risk management goals, and appropriately allocating efforts tomanage disaster risks, for at least two sets of reasons. First, as discussed inChapters 3 and 4, climate change is very likely to increase the occurrence
and vary the location of some physical events, which in turn will affectthe exposure faced by many communities, as well as their vulnerability.
Increased exposure and vulnerability would contribute to an increase indisaster risk. For example, vulnerability may increase due to direct climate-related impacts on the development and development potential of theaffected area, because resources otherwise available and directedtowards development goals are deflected to respond to those impacts,or because long-standing institutions for allocating resources such aswater no longer function as intended if climate change affects thescarcity and distribution of that resource. Second, climate change willmake it more difficult to anticipate, evaluate, and communicate bothprobabilities and consequences that contribute to disaster risk, inparticular that associated with extreme events. This set of issues,discussed in this subsection, will affect the management of these risksas discussed in Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 ( high confidence ).
1.3.1.1. Challenge of Quantitative Estimates of Changing Risks
Extreme events pose a particular set of challenges for implementing
probabilistic approaches because their relative infrequency often makesit difficult to obtain adequate data for estimating the probabilities andconsequences. Climate change exacerbates this challenge because itcontributes to potential changes in the frequency and character of suchevents (see Section 1.2.2.2).
The likelihood of extreme events is most commonly described by the
return period, the mean interval expected between one such event and itsrecurrence. For example, one might speak of a 100-year flood or a 50-yearwindstorm. More formally, these intervals are inversely proportional tothe ‘annual exceedance probability,’ the likelihood that an event
exceeding some magnitude occurs in any given year. Thus the 100-year
flood has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year (which translates
into a 37% chance of a century passing without at least one such flood
((1-0.01)
100 = 37%). Though statistical methods exist to estimate
frequencies longer than available data time series (Milly et al., 2002),
the long return period of extreme events can make it difficult, if not
impossible, to reliably estimate their frequency. Paleoclimate records
make clear that in many regions of the world, the last few decades ofobserved climate data do not represent the full natural variability ofmany important climate variables (Jansen et al., 2003). In addition,
future climate change exacerbates the challenge of non-stationarity(Milly et al., 2008), where the statistical properties of weather eventswill not remain constant over time. This complicates an already difficultestimation challenge by altering frequencies and consequences ofextremes in difficult-to-predict ways (Chapter 3; Meehl et al., 2007; TRB,2008; NRC, 2009). 
Estimating the likelihood of different consequences and their value is at
least as challenging as estimating the likelihood of extreme events.Projecting future vulnerability and response capacity involves predictingthe trends and changes in underlying causes of human vulnerability andthe behavior of complex human systems under potentially stressful andnovel conditions. For instance, disaster risk is endogenous in the sense thatnear-term actions to manage risk may affect future risk in unintendedways and near-term actions may affect perceptions of future risks (seeBox 1-3). Section 1.4 describes some of the challenges such systemcomplexity may pose for effective risk assessment. In addition, disastersaffect socioeconomic systems in multiple ways so that assigning aquantitative value to the consequences of a disaster proves difficult (seeSection 1.2.3.3). The literature distinguishes between direct losses,which are the immediate consequences of the disaster-related physicalevents, and indirect losses, which are the consequences that result fromthe disruption of life and activity after the immediate impacts of theevent (Pelling et al., 2002; Lindell and Prater, 2003; Cochrane, 2004; Rose,2004). Section 1.3.2 discusses some means to address these challenges.
1.3.1.2. Processes that Influence Judgments
about Changing Risks
Effective risk governance engages a wide range of stakeholder groups
– such as scientists, policymakers, private firms, nongovernmentalorganizations, media, educators, and the public – in a process ofexchanging, integrating, and sharing knowledge and information. Therecently emerging field of sustainability science (Kates et al., 2001)promotes interactive co-production of knowledge between experts andother actors, based on transdisciplinarity (Jasanoff, 2004; Pohl et al.,2010) and social learning (Pelling et al., 2008; Pahl-Wostl, 2009; see alsoSection 1.4.2). The literature on judgment and decisionmaking suggeststhat various cognitive behaviors involving perceptions and judgmentsabout low-probability, high-severity events can complicate the intendedfunctioning of such stakeholder processes (see Box 1-3). Climate changecan exacerbate these challenges ( high confidence ).
The concepts of disaster, risk, and disaster risk management have very
different meanings and interpretations in expert and non-expert contexts(Sjöberg, 1999a; see also Pidgeon and Fischhoff, 2011). Experts actingin formal private and public sector roles often employ quantitativeestimates of both probability and consequence in making judgmentsabout risk. In contrast, the general public, politicians, and the mediatend to focus on the concrete adverse consequences of such events,paying less attention to their likelihood (Sjöberg, 1999b). As describedChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience47in Box 1-3, expert estimates of probability and consequence may also
not address the full range of concerns people bring to the considerationof risk. By definition (if not always in practice), expert understanding ofrisks associated with extreme events is based in large part on analytictools. In particular, any estimates of changes in disaster risk due toclimate change are often based on the results of complex climatemodels as described in Chapter 3. Non-experts, on the other hand, relyto a greater extent on more readily available and more easily processedinformation, such as their own experiences or vicarious experiences fromthe stories communicated through the news media, as well as theirsubjective judgment as to the importance of such events (see Box 1-1).These gaps between expert and non-expert understanding of extremeevents present important communication challenges (Weber and Stern,2011), which may adversely affect judgments about the allocation ofefforts to address risk that is changing over time ( high confidence ).
Quantitative methods based on probabilistic risk analysis, such as those
described in Sections 5.5 and 6.3, can allow people operating in expertcontexts to use observed data, often from long time series, to makesystematic and internally consistent estimates of the probability offuture events. As described in Section 1.3.1.1, climate change mayreduce the accuracy of such past observations as predictors for futurerisk. Individuals, including non-experts and experts making estimateswithout the use of formal methods (Barke et al., 1997), often predict thelikelihood of encountering an event in the future by consulting theirpast experiences with such events. The ‘availability’ heuristic (i.e., usefulshortcut) is commonly applied, in which the likelihood of an event isjudged by the ease with which past instances can be brought to mind(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). Extreme events, by definition, have alow probability of being represented in past experience and thus will berelatively unavailable. Experts and non-experts alike may essentiallyignore such events until they occur, as in the case of a 100-year flood(Hertwig et al., 2004). When extreme events do occur with severe andthus memorable consequences, people’s estimates of their future riskswill, at least temporarily, become inflated (Weber et al., 2004).
1.3.2. Adaptation to Climate Change
Contributes to Disaster Risk Management 
The literature and practice of adaptation to climate change attempts to
anticipate future impacts on human society and ecosystems, such as
those described in Chapter 4, and respond to those already experienced.
In recent years, the adaptation to climate change literature has introducedthe concept of climate-related decisions (and climate proofing), which
are choices by individuals or organizations, the outcomes of which can
be expected to be affected by climate change and its interactions with
ecological, economic, and social systems (Brown et al., 2006; McGray etal., 2007; Colls et al., 2009; Dulal et al., 2009; NRC, 2009). For instance,choosing to build in a low-lying area whose future flooding risk increasesdue to climate change represents a climate-related decision. Such a
decision is climate-related whether or not the decisionmakers recognize
it as such. The disaster risk management community may derive addedimpetus from the new context of a changing climate for certain of its
pre-existing practices that already reflect the implementation of thisconcept. In many circumstances, choices about the appropriate allocationof efforts among disaster management, disaster risk reduction, and risktransfer actions will be affected by changes in the frequency andcharacter of extreme events and other impacts of a climate change onthe underlying conditions that affect exposure and vulnerability.
Much of the relevant adaptation literature addresses how expectations
about future deviations from past patterns in physical, biological, andsocioeconomic conditions due to climate change should affect theallocation of efforts to manage risks. While there exist differing viewson the extent to which the adaptation to climate change literature hasunique insights on managing changing conditions per se that it canbring to disaster risk management (Lavell, 2010; Mercer, 2010; Wisneret al., 2011), the former field’s interest in anticipating and respondingto the full range of consequences from changing climatic conditions canoffer important new perspectives and capabilities to the latter field.
The disaster risk management community can benefit from the debates
in the adaptation literature about how to best incorporate informationabout current and future climate into climate-related decisions. Someadaptation literature has emphasized the leading role of accurateregional climate predictions as necessary to inform such decisions(Collins, 2007; Barron, 2009; Doherty et al., 2009; Goddard et al., 2009;Shukla et al., 2009; Piao et al., 2010; Shapiro et al., 2010). This argumenthas been criticized on the grounds that predictions of future climateimpacts are highly uncertain (Dessai and Hulme, 2004; Cox andStephenson, 2007; Stainforth et al., 2007; Dessai et al., 2009; Hawkinsand Sutton, 2009; Knutti, 2010) and that predictions are insufficient tomotivate action (Fischhoff, 1994; Sarewitz et al., 2000; Cash et al., 2003,2006; Rayner et al., 2005; Moser and Luers, 2008; Dessai et al., 2009;NRC, 2009). Other adaptation literature has emphasized that manycommunities do not sufficiently manage current risks and that improvingthis situation would go a long way toward preparing them for anyfuture changes due to climate change (Smit and Wandel, 2006; Pielke etal., 2007). As discussed in Section 1.4, this approach will in some casesunderestimate the challenges of adapting to future climate change.
To address these challenges, the adaptation literature has increasingly
discussed an iterative risk management framework (Carter et al., 2007;Jones and Preston, 2011), which is consistent with risk governance asdescribed earlier in this section. Iterative risk management recognizesthat the process of anticipating and responding to climate change doesnot constitute a single set of judgments at some point in time, but ratheran ongoing assessment, action, reassessment, and response that willcontinue – in the case of many climate-related decisions – indefinitely(ACC, 2010). In many cases, iterative risk management contends withconditions where the probabilities underlying estimates of future riskare imprecise and/or the structure of the models that relate events toconsequences are under-determined (NRC, 2009; Morgan et al., 2009).Such deep or severe uncertainty (Lempert and Collins, 2007) cancharacterize not only understanding of future climatic events but alsoChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience48future patterns of human vulnerability and the capability to respond to
such events. With many complex, poorly understood physical andsocioeconomic systems, research and social learning may enrichunderstanding over time, but the amount of uncertainty, as measuredby observers’ ability to make specific, accurate predictions, may growlarger (Morgan et al., 2009, pp. 114–115; NRC, 2009, pp. 18–19; seerelated discussion of ‘surprises’ in Section 3.1.7). In addition, theory andmodels may change in ways that make them less, rather than more,reliable as predictive tools over time (Oppenheimer et al., 2008). 
Recent literature has thus explored a variety of approaches that can
help disaster risk management address such uncertainties (McGray etal., 2007; IIED 2009; Schipper, 2009), in particular approaches that helpsupport decisions when it proves difficult or impossible to accuratelyestimate probabilities of events and their adverse consequences.Approaches for characterizing uncertainty include qualitative scenariomethods (Parson et al., 2007); fuzzy sets (Chongfu, 1996; El-Baroudyand Simonovic, 2004; Karimi and Hullermeier, 2007; Simonovic, 2010);and the use of ranges of values or sets of distributions, rather than singlevalues or single best-estimate distributions (Morgan et al., 2009; seealso Mastrandrea et al., 2010). Others have suggested managing suchuncertainty with robust policies that perform well over a wide range ofplausible futures (Dessai and Hulme, 2007; Groves and Lempert, 2007;Brown, 2010; Means et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Dessai andWilby, 2011; Reeder and Ranger, 2011; also see discussion in Chapter 8).Decision rules based on the concept of robust adaptive policies gobeyond ‘no regrets’ by suggesting how in some cases relatively low-cost, near-term actions and explicit plans to adjust those actions overtime can significantly improve future ability to manage risk (WorldBank, 2009; Hine and Hall, 2010; Lempert and Groves, 2010; Walker etal., 2010; Brown, 2011; Ranger and Garbett-Shiels, 2011; see alsoSection 1.4.5). 
The resilience literature, as described in Chapter 8, also takes an interest
in managing difficult-to-predict futures. Both the adaptation to climatechange and vulnerability literatures often take an actor-oriented view(Wisner et al., 2004; McLaughlin and Dietz, 2007; Nelson et al., 2007;Moser 2009) that focuses on particular agents faced with a set ofdecisions who can make choices based on their various preferences;
their institutional interests, power, and capabilities; and the information
they have available. Robustness in the adaptation to climate changecontext often refers to a property of decisions specific actors may take
(Hallegatte, 2009; Lempert and Groves, 2010; Dessai and Wilby, 2011).In contrast, the resilience literature tends to take a systems view (Olsson
et al., 2006; Walker et al., 2006; Berkes, 2007; Nelson et al., 2007) thatconsiders multi-interacting agents and their relationships in and with
complex social, ecological, and geophysical systems (Miller et al., 2010).
These literatures can help highlight for disaster risk management such
issues as the tension between resilience to specific, known disturbances
and novel and unexpected ones (sometimes referred to as the distinctionbetween ‘specified’ and ‘general’ resilience, Miller et al., 2010), thetension between resilience at different spatial and temporal scales, and
the tension between the ability of a system to persist in its current stateand its ability to transform to a fundamentally new state (Section 1.4;
Chapter 8; ICSU, 2002; Berkes, 2007). 
Disaster risk management will find similarities to its own multi-sector
approach in the adaptation literature’s recent emphasis, consistent withthe concept of climate-related decisions, on climate change as one ofmany factors affecting the management of risks. For instance, someresource management agencies now stress climate change as one of manytrends such as growing demand for resources, environmental constraints,aging infrastructure, and technological change that, particularly incombination, could require changes in investment plans and businessmodels (CCSP , 2008; Brick et al., 2010). It has become clear that manyless-developed regions will have limited success in reducing overallvulnerability solely by managing climate risk because vulnerability,adaptive capacity, and exposure are critically influenced by existingstructural deficits (low income and high inequality, lack of access tohealth and education, lack of security and political access, etc.). Forexample, in drought-ravaged northeastern Brazil, many vulnerablehouseholds could not take advantage of risk management interventionssuch as seed distribution programs because they lacked money to travelto pick up the seeds or could not afford a day’s lost labor to participatein the program (Lemos, 2003). In Burkina Faso, farmers had limitedability to use seasonal forecasts (a risk management strategy) becausethey lacked the resources (basic agricultural technology such as plows,alternative crop varieties, fertilizers, etc.) needed to effectively respondto the projections (Ingram et al., 2002). In Bangladesh, however, despitepersisting poverty, improved disaster preparedness and response andrelative higher levels of household adaptive capacity have dramaticallydecreased the number of deaths as a result of flooding (del Ninno et al.,2002, 2003; Section 9.2.5). 
Scholars have argued that building adaptive capacity in such regions
requires a dialectic, two-tiered process in which climatic risk management(specific adaptive capacity) and deeper-level socioeconomic and politicalreform (generic adaptive capacity) iterate to shape overall vulnerability(Lemos et al., 2007; Tompkins et al., 2008). When implemented as part ofa systems approach, managing climate risks can create positive synergieswith development goals through participatory and transparentapproaches (such as participatory vulnerability mapping or local disasterrelief committees) that empower local households and institutions (e.g.,Degg and Chester, 2005; Nelson, 2005). 
1.3.3. Disaster Risk Management and
Adaptation to Climate Change ShareMany Concepts, Goals, and Processes
The efficacy of the mix of actions used by communities to reduce,
transfer, and respond to current levels of disaster risk could be vastlyincreased. Understanding and recognition of the many development-based instruments that could be put into motion to achieve disaster riskreduction is a prerequisite for this (Lavell and Lavell, 2009; UNISDR,2009e, 2011; Maskrey 2011; Wisner et al., 2011). At the same time,Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience49some aspects of disaster risk will increase for many communities due to
climate change and other factors (Chapters 3 and 4). Exploiting thepotential synergies between disaster risk management and adaptationto climate change literature and practice will improve management ofboth current and future risks. 
Both fields share a common interest in understanding and reducing the
risk created by the interactions of human with physical and biologicalsystems. Both seek appropriate allocations of risk reduction, risktransfer, and disaster management efforts, for instance balancing pre-impact risk management or adaptation with post-impact response andrecovery. Decisions in both fields may be organized according to therisk governance framework. For instance, many countries, are gainingexperience in implementing cooperative, inter-sector and multi- orinterdisciplinary approaches (ICSU, 2002; Brown et al., 2006; McGray etal., 2007; Lavell and Lavell, 2009). In general, disaster risk managementcan help those practicing adaptation to climate change to learn fromaddressing current impacts. Adaptation to climate change can helpthose practicing disaster risk management to more effectively addressfuture conditions that will differ from those of today. 
The integration of concepts and practices is made more difficult because
the two fields often use different terminology, emerge from differentacademic communities, and may be seen as the responsibility of differentgovernment organizations. As one example, Section 1.4 will describehow the two fields use the word ‘coping’ with different meanings anddifferent connotations. In general, various contexts have made it moredifficult to recognize that the two fields share many concepts, goals, andprocesses, as well as to exploit the synergies that arise from their
differences. These include differences in historical and evolutionaryprocesses; conceptual and definitional bases; processes of socialknowledge construction and the ensuing scientific compartmentalizationof subject areas; institutional and organizational funding andinstrumental backgrounds; scientific origins and baseline literature;conceptions of the relevant causal relations; and the relative importanceof different risk factors (see Sperling and Szekely, 2005; Schipper andPelling, 2006; Thomalla et al., 2006; Mitchell and van Aalst, 2008;Venton and La Trobe, 2008, Schipper and Burton, 2009; Lavell, 2010).These aspects will be considered in more detail in future chapters.
Potential synergies from the fields’ different emphases include the
following.
First, disaster risk management covers a wide range of hazardous
events, including most of those of interest in the adaptation to climatechange literature and practice. Thus, adaptation could benefit from
experience in managing disaster risks that are analogous to the newchallenges expected under climate change. For example, relocation andother responses considered when confronted with sea level change canbe informed by disaster risk management responses to persistent orlarge-scale flooding and landslides or volcanic activity and actions withpre- or post-disaster relocation; responses to water shortages due to lossof glacial meltwater would bear similarities to shortages due to otherdrought stressors; and public health challenges due to modifications indisease vectors due to climate change have similarities to thoseassociated with current climate variability, such as the occurrence of
Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
FAQ 1.2 | What are effective strategies for managing disaster risk in a changing climate?
Disaster risk management has historically operated under the premise that future climate will resemble that of the past. Climat e change
now adds greater uncertainty to the assessment of hazards and vulnerability. This will make it more difficult to anticipate, ev aluate, and
communicate disaster risk. Uncertainty, however, is not a ‘new’ problem. Previous experience with disaster risk management unde r
uncertainty, or where long return periods for extreme events prevail, can inform effective risk reduction, response, and prepar ation, as
well as disaster risk management strategies in general. 
Because climate variability occurs over a wide range of timescales, there is often a historical record of previous efforts to m anage and
adapt to climate-related risk that is relevant to risk management under climate change. These efforts provide a basis for learn ing via
the assessment of responses, interventions, and recovery from previous impacts. Although efforts to incorporate learning into t he
management of weather- and climate-related risks have not always succeeded, such adaptive approaches constitute a plausible mod el
for longer-term efforts. Learning is most effective when it leads to evaluation of disaster risk management strategies, particu larly with
regard to the allocation of resources and efforts between risk reduction, risk sharing, and disaster response and recovery effo rts, and
when it engages a wide range of stakeholder groups, particularly affected communities.
In the presence of deeply uncertain long-term changes in climate and vulnerability, disaster risk management and adaptation to climate
change may be advanced by dealing adequately with the present, anticipating a wide range of potential climate changes, and prom oting
effective ‘no-regrets’ approaches to both current vulnerabilities and to predicted changes in disaster risk. A robust plan or s trategy that
both encompasses and looks beyond the current situation with respect to hazards and vulnerability will perform well over a wide  range
of plausible climate changes. 50El Niño. Moreover, like disaster risk management, adaptation to climate
change will often take place within a multi-hazard locational frameworkgiven that many areas affected by climate change will also be affectedby other persistent and recurrent hazards (Wisner et al., 2004, 2011;Lavell, 2010; Mercer, 2010). Additionally, learning from disaster riskmanagement can help adaptation, which to date has focused more onchanges in the climate mean, increasing its focus on future changes inclimate extremes and other potentially damaging events. 
Second, disaster risk management has tended to encourage an expanded,
bottom-up, grass roots approach, emphasizing local and community-based risk management in the framework of national managementsystems (see Chapters 5 and 6), while an important segment of theadaptation literature focuses on social and economic sectors and macroecosystems over large regional scales. However, a large body of theadaptation literature – in both developed and developing countries – isvery locally focused. Both fields could benefit from the body of work onthe determinants of adaptive capacity that focus on the interaction ofindividual and collective action and institutions that frame their actions(McGray et al., 2007; Schipper, 2009).
Third, the current disaster risk management literature emphasizes the
social conditioning of risk and the construction of vulnerability as a causalfactor in explaining loss and damage. Early adaptation literature andsome more recent output, particularly from the climate change field,prioritizes physical events and exposure, seeing vulnerability as whatremains after all other factors have been considered (O’Brien et al.,2007). However, community-based adaptation work in developingcountries (Beer and Hamilton, 2002; Brown et al., 2006; Lavell andLavell, 2009; UNISDR, 2009b,c) and a growing number of studies indeveloped nations (Burby and Nelson, 1991; de Bruin et al., 2009;Bedsworth and Hanak, 2010; Brody et al., 2010; Corfee-Morlot et al.,2011; Moser and Eckstrom, 2011) have considered social causation.Both fields could benefit from further integration of these concepts.
Overall, the disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change
literatures both now emphasize the value of a more holistic, integrated,trans-disciplinary approach to risk management (ICSU-LAC, 2009).
Dividing the world up sectorally and thematically has often provenorganizationally convenient in government and academia, but can
undermine a thorough understanding of the complexity and interaction
of the human and physical factors involved in the constitution and
definition of a problem at different social, temporal, and territorial
scales. A more integrated approach facilitates recognition of the complexrelationships among diverse social, temporal, and spatial contexts;highlights the importance of decision processes that employ participatorymethods and decentralization within a supporting hierarchy of higher
levels; and emphasizes that many disaster risk management and other
organizations currently face climate-related decisions whether they
recognize them or not.
The following areas, some of which have been pursued by governments,
civil society actors, and communities, have been recommended orproposed to foster such integration between, and greater effectiveness
of, both adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management(see also WRI, 2008; Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010; Lavell, 2010):
•Development of a common lexicon and deeper understanding ofthe concepts and terms used in each field (Schipper and Burton,2009)
•Implementation of government policymaking and strategyformulation that jointly considers the two topics
•Evolution of national and international organizations and institutionsand their programs that merge and synchronize around thetwo themes, such as environmental ministries coordinating withdevelopment and planning ministries (e.g., National EnvironmentalPlanning Authority in Jamaica and Peruvian Ministries of Economyand Finance, Housing, and Environment)
•Merging and/or coordinating disaster risk management andadaptation financing mechanisms through development agenciesand nongovernmental organizations
•The use of participatory, local level risk and context analysismethodologies inspired by disaster risk management that are nowstrongly accepted by many civil society and government agenciesin work on adaptation at the local levels (IFRC, 2007; Lavell andLavell, 2009; UNISDR, 2009 b,c)
•Implementing bottom-up approaches whereby local communitiesintegrate adaptation to climate change, disaster risk management,and other environmental and development concerns in a single,causally dimensioned intervention framework, commensuratemany times with their own integrated views of their own physicaland social environments (Moench and Dixit, 2004; Lavell andLavell, 2009). 
1.4. Coping and Adapting 
The discussion in this section has four goals: to clarify the relationshipbetween adaptation and coping, particularly the notion of coping range;to highlight the role of learning in an adaptation process; to discussbarriers to successful adaptation and the issue of maladaptation; andto highlight examples of learning in the disaster risk managementcommunity that have already advanced climate change adaptation. 
A key conclusion of this section is that learning is central to adaptation,
and that there are abundant examples (see Section 1.4.5 and Chapter 9)of the disaster risk management community learning from prior experienceand adjusting its practices to respond to a wide range of existing andevolving hazards. These cases provide the adaptation to climate changecommunity with the opportunity not only to study the specifics of learningas outlined in these cases, but also to reflect on how another communitythat also addresses climate-related risk has incorporated learning intoits practice over time. 
As disaster risk management includes both coping and adapting, and
these two concepts are central for adaptation to climate change in bothscholarship and practice, it is important to start by clarifying the mean ingsChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience51of these terms. Without a clear conception of the distinctions between
the concepts and overlaps in their meanings, it is difficult to fullyunderstand a wide range of related issues, including those concernedwith the coping range, adaptive capacity, and the role of institutionallearning in promoting robust adaptation to climate change. Clarifyingsuch distinctions carries operational significance for decisionmakersinterested in promoting resilience, a process that relies on coping forimmediate survival and recovery, as well as adaptation and disasterrisk reduction, which entail integrating new information to moderatepotential future harm.
1.4.1. Definitions, Distinctions, and Relationships
In both the disaster risk management and climate change adaptationliterature, substantial differences are apparent as to the meaning andsignificance of coping as well as its relationship with and distinctionfrom adaptation. Among the discrepancies, for example, some disasterrisk management scholars have referred to coping as a way to engagelocal populations and utilize indigenous knowledge in disasterpreparedness and response (Twigg, 2004), while others have critiqued thisidea, concerned that it would divert attention away from addressingstructural problems (Davies, 1993) and lead to a focus on ‘surviving’instead of ‘thriving.’ There has also been persistent debate over whethercoping primarily occurs before or after a disastrous event (UNISDR,2008b,c, 2009e). This debate is not entirely resolved by the currentUNISDR definition of coping, the “ability of people, organizations, andsystems, using available skills and resources, to face and manageadverse conditions, emergencies or disasters” (UNISDR, 2009d). Clearly,emergencies and disasters are post facto circumstances, but ‘adverseconditions’ is an indeterminate concept that could include negative pre-impact livelihood conditions and disaster risk circumstances or merelypost-impact effects. 
The first part of this section is focused on parsing these two concepts.
Once the terms are adequately distinguished, the focus shifts in thesecond part to important relationships between the two terms and otherrelated concepts, which taken together have operational significance for
governments and stakeholders.
1.4.1.1. Definitions and Distinctions
Despite the importance of the term coping in the fields of both disasterrisk management and adaptation to climate change, there is substantial
confusion regarding the term’s meaning (Davies, 1996) and how it is
distinguished from adaptation. 
In order to clarify this aspect, it is helpful first to look outside of the
disaster risk and adaptation contexts. The Oxford English Dictionary
defines coping as “the action or process of overcoming a problem or
difficulty” or “managing or enduring a stressful situation or condition”and adapting as “rendering suitable, modifying” (OED, 1989). As notedin Table 1-1, contrasting the two terms highlights several important
dimensions in which they differ – exigency, constraint, reactivity, andorientation – relevant examples of which can be found in the literaturecited.
Overall, coping focuses on the moment, constraint, and survival;
adapting (in terms of human responses) focuses on the future, wherelearning and reinvention are key features and short-term survival is lessin question (although it remains inclusive of changes inspired byalready-modified environmental conditions). 
1.4.1.2. Relationships between Coping, Coping Capacity,
Adaptive Capacity, and the Coping Range
The definitions of coping and adapting used in this report reflect the
dictionary definitions. As an example, a community cannot adapt its waythrough the aftermath of a disastrous hurricane; it must cope instead.Its coping capacity, or capacity to respond (Gallopín, 2003), is a functionof currently available resources that can be used to cope, and determinesthe community’s ability to survive the disaster intact (Bankoff, 2004;Wisner et al., 2004). Repeated use of coping mechanisms withoutadequate time and provisions for recovery can reduce coping capacityand shift a community into what has been termed transient poverty(Lipton and Ravallion, 1995). Rather than leaving resources for adaptation,communities forced to cope can become increasingly vulnerable tofuture hazards (O’Brien and Leichenko, 2000). 
Adaptation in anticipation of future hurricanes, however, can limit the
need for coping that may be required to survive the next storm. Acommunity’s adaptive capacity will determine the degree to whichadaptation can be pursued (Smit and Pilofosova, 2003). While there isChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
Dimension  Coping  Adapting  
Exigency  Survival in the face of immediate, 
unusually signiﬁcant stress, when resources, which may have been minimal to start with, are taxed 
(Wisner et al., 2004).Reorientation in response to 
recent past or anticipated future change, often without speciﬁc reference to resource limitations. 
Constraint  Survival is foremost and tactics are 
constrained by available 
knowledge, experience, and assets; 
reinvention is a secondary concern (Bankoff, 2004). Adjustment is the focus and 
strategy is constrained less by 
current limits than by 
assumptions regarding future resource availability and trends. 
Reactivity  Decisions are primarily tactical and 
made with the goal of protecting
basic welfare and providing for 
basic human security after an event 
has occurred (Adger, 2000). Decisions are strategic and 
focused on anticipating change 
and addressing this proactively (Füssel, 2007), even if spurred by 
recent events seen as harbingers 
of further change. 
Orientation  Focus is on past events that shape 
current conditions and limitations; 
by extension, the focus is also on previously successful tactics (Bankoff, 2004). Focus on future conditions and 
 
 strategies; past tactics are 
relevant to the extent they might facilitate adjustment, though 
some experts believe past and 
future orientation can overlap 
and blend (Chen, 1991).Table 1-1 | The various dimensions of coping and adapting.52some variability in how coping capacity and adaptive capacity are
defined, the literature generally recognizes that adaptive capacityfocuses on longer -term and more sustained adjustments (Gallopín, 2006;
Smit and Wandel, 2006). However, in the same way that repeatedlyinvoking coping mechanisms consumes resources available for subsequentcoping needs, it also consumes resources that might otherwise be
available for adaptation (Adger, 1996; Risbey et al., 1999).
There is also a link between adaptation and the coping range – that
is, a system’s capacity to reactively accommodate variations in climatic
conditions and their impacts (a system can range from a particular
ecosystem to a society) (IPCC, 2007b). In the adaptation literature,
Yohe and Tol (2002, p. 26) have used the term to refer to the range of
“circumstances within which, by virtue of the underlying resilience of
the system, significant consequences are not observed” in response toexternal stressors. Outside the coping range, communities will “feel
significant effects from change and/or variability in their environments”
(Yohe and Tol, 2002, p. 25). Within its coping range, a community
can survive and even thrive with significant natural hazards. This is
particularly the case when the historical distribution of hazard intensityis well known and relatively stable (see Section 1.2.3.4). A community’s
coping range is determined, in part, by prior adaptation (Hewitt andBurton, 1971; de Vries, 1985; de Freitas, 1989), and a community is mostlikely to survive and thrive when adaptation efforts have matched itscoping range with the range of hazards it typically encounters (Smit andPilifosova, 2003). As climate change alters future variability and theoccurrence of extreme events, and as societal trends change humansystems’ vulnerability, adaptation is required to adjust the coping rangeso as to maintain societal functioning within an expected or acceptablerange of risk (Moser and Luers, 2008).
Box 1-4 provides an example of this process in the region that is now
The Netherlands. As this box illustrates, the process of shifting a society’scoping range both depends on and facilitates further economicdevelopment (i.e., requires adaptive capacity and enhances copingcapacity). The box also illustrates that the process requires continuousreassessment of risk and adjustment in response to shifting hazarddistributions in order to avoid increasing, and maladaptive, hazardexposure. Successful adjustments, facilitated in part by institutionallearning, can widen and shift a community’s coping range, promotingChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience
Box 1-4 | Adaptation to Rising Levels of Risk
Before AD 1000, in the low-lying coastal floodplain of the southern North Sea and around the Rhine delta, the area that is now The
Netherlands, the inhabitants lived on dwelling mounds, piled up to lie above the height of the majority of extreme storm surges . By the
10th century, with a population estimated at 300,000 people, inhabitants had begun to construct the first dikes, and within 400  years
had ringed all significant areas of land above spring tide, allowing animals to graze and people to live in the protected wetla nds. The
expansion of habitable land encouraged a significant increase in the population exposed to catastrophic floods (Borger and Ligt endag,
1998). The weak sea dikes broke in a series of major storm surge floods through the stormy 13th and 14th centuries (in particul ar in
1212, 1219, 1287, and 1362), flooding enormous areas (often permanently) and causing more than 200,000 fatalities, reflecting a n
estimated lifetime mortality rate from floods for those living in the region in excess of 5% (assuming a 30-year average lifesp an;
Gottschalk, 1971, 1975, 1977). 
To adapt to increasingly adverse environmental conditions (reflecting long-term delta subsidence), major improvements in the te chnology
of dike construction and drainage engineering began in the 15th century. As the country became richer and population increased (to an
estimated 950,000 by 1500 and 1.9 million by 1700), it became an imperative not only to provide better levels of protection but  also to
reclaim land from the sea and from the encroaching lakes, both to reduce flood hazard and expand the land available for food pr oduction
(Hoeksma, 2006). Examples of the technological innovations included the development of windmills for pumping, and methods to li ft
water at least 4 m whether by running windmills in series or through the use of the wind-powered Archimedes screw. As important  was
the availability of capital to be invested in joint stock companies with the sole purpose of land reclamation. In 1607, a compa ny was
formed to reclaim the 72 km2Beemster Lake north of Amsterdam (12 times larger than any previous reclamation). A 50-km canal and
dike ring were excavated, a total of 50 windmills installed that after five years pumped dry the Beemster polder, 3 to 4 m belo w the
surrounding countryside, which, within 30 years, had been settled by 200 farmhouses and 2,000 people. 
After the major investment in raising and strengthening flood defenses in the 17th century, there were two or three large flood s, one in
1717 (when 14,000 people drowned) and two notable floods in 1825 and 1953; since that time the average flood mortality rate hasbeen around 1,000 per century, equivalent to a lifetime mortality rate (assuming a 50-year average lifetime) of around 0.01%, 5 00 times
lower than that which had prevailed through the Middle Ages (Van Baars and Van Kempen, 2009). This change reflects increased pr otection
rather than any reduction in storminess. The flood hazard and attendant risk is now considered to be rising again (Bouwer and V ellinga,
2007) and plans are being developed to manage further rises, shifting the coping range in anticipation of the new hazard distri bution.53resilience to a wider range of future disaster risk (Yohe and Tol, 2002),
as illustrated in Box 1-4 and discussed further in Section 1.4.2 ( high
confidence ).
1.4.2. Learning
Risk management decisions are made within social-ecological systems
(a term referring to social systems intimately tied to and dependent onenvironmental resources and conditions). Some social-ecological systemsare more resilient than others. The most resilient are characterized by
their capacity to learn and adjust, their ability to reorganize after
disruption, and their retention of fundamental structure and function inthe face of system stress (Fol ke, 2006). The ability to cope with extreme
stress and resume normal function is thus an important component ofresilience, but learning, reorganizing, and changing over time are alsokey. As Chapter 8 highlights, transformational changes are required toachieve a future in which society’s most important social-ecologicalsystems are sustainable and resilient. Learning, along with adaptivemanagement, innovation, and leadership, is essential to this process.
Learning related to social-ecological systems requires recognizing
their complex dynamics, including delays, stock-and-flow dynamics,and feedback loops (Sterman, 2000), features that can complicatemanagement strategies by making it difficult to perceive how a systemoperates. Heuristic devices and mental models can sometimes inhibitlearning by obscuring a problem’s full complexity (Kahneman et al., 1982;Section 1.3.1.2) and complicating policy action among both experts andlay people (Cronin et al., 2009). For instance, common heuristics (seeSection 1.3.1.2) lead to misunderstanding of the relationship betweengreenhouse gas emission rates and their accumulation in atmospheric
stocks, lending credence to a ‘wait and see’ approach to mitigation(Sterman, 2008). Through a variety of mechanisms, such factors can leadto paralysis and failure to engage in appropriate risk managementstrategies despite the availability of compelling evidence pointing toparticular risk management pathways (Sterman, 2006). The resultinglearning barriers thus deserve particular attention when exploring howto promote learning that will lead to effective adaptation.
Given the complex dynamics of social-ecological systems and their
interaction with a changing climate, the literature on adaptation to climatechange (usually referred to here, as above, simply as ‘adaptation’)emphasizes iterative learning and management plans that are explicitlydesigned to evolve as new information becomes available (Morgan etal., 2009: NRC, 2009). Unlike adaptation, the field of disaster riskmanagement has not historically focused as explicitly on the implicationsof climate change and the need for iterative learning. However, thefield provides several important examples of learning, including somepresented in Chapter 9, that could be instructive to adaptationpractitioners. Before introducing these case studies in Section 1.4.5, wewill outline relevant theory of institutional learning and ‘learning loops.’
Extensive literature explores both the role of learning in adaptation
(Armitage et al., 2008; Moser, 2010; Pettengell, 2010) and strategies forfacilitating institutional and social learning in ‘complex adaptive systems’(Pahl-Wostl, 2009). Some important strategies include the use ofknowledge co-production, wherein scientists, policymakers, and otheractors work together to exchange, generate, and apply knowledge(van Kerkhoff and Lebel, 2006), and action research, an iterative processin which teams of researchers develop hypotheses about real-world

(List, 2006). Prior work on learning theories, for example, experientiallearning (Kolb, 1984) and transformative learning (Mezirow, 1995),emphasize the importance of action-oriented problem-solving, learning-by-doing, concrete learning cycles, and how these processes result inreflection, reconsideration of meaning, and re-interpretation of valuestructures. The learning loop framework (Kolb and Fry, 1975; Argyris andSchön, 1978; Keen et al., 2005) integrates these theories and divideslearning processes into three different loops depending on the degreeto which the learning promotes transformational change in managementstrategies. Figure 1-3 outlines this framework and its application to theissue of flood management.
In single-loop learning processes, changes are made based on the
difference between what is expected and what is observed. Single-looplearning is primarily focused on improving the efficiency of action(Pelling et al., 2008) and answering the question of “whether things arebeing done right” (Flood and Romm, 1996), that is, whether managementtactics are appropriate or adequate to achieve identified objectives. Inflood management, for example, when floodwaters threaten to breachexisting flood defenses, flood managers may ask whether dike andlevee heights are sufficient and make adjustments accordingly. AsFigure 1-3 indicates, single-loop learning focuses primarily on actions;data are integrated and acted on but the underlying mental model usedto process the data is not changed. 
In double-loop learning, the evaluation is extended to assess whether
actors are “doing the right things” (Flood and Romm, 1996), that is,whether management goals and strategies are appropriate. Correctiveactions are made after the problem is reframed and different managementgoals are identified (Pelling et al., 2008); data are used to promotecritical thinking and challenge underlying mental models of what worksand why. Continuing with the flood management example, double-looplearning results when the goals of the current flood managementregime are critically examined to determine if the regime is sustainableand resilient to anticipated shifts in hydrological extremes over aparticular time period. For instance, in a floodplain protected by leveesbuilt to withstand a 500-year flood, a shift in the annual exceedanceprobability from 0.002 to 0.005 (equivalent to stating that the likelihood
that a 500-year flood will occur in a given year has shifted to that seenhistorically for a 200-year event) will prompt questions about whetherthe increased likelihood of losses justifies different risk management
decisions, ranging from increased investments in flood defenses to
changed insurance policies for the vulnerable populations.
Many authors also distinguish triple-loop learning (Argyris and Schön,
1978; Hargrove, 2002; Peschl, 2007), or learning that questions deeplyheld underlying principles (Pelling et al., 2008). In triple-loop learning,actors question how institutional and other power relationships determineperceptions of the range of possible interventions, allowable costs, and
appropriate strategies (Flood and Romm, 1996). In response to evidencethat management strategies are not serving a larger agreed-upon goal,that is, they are maladaptive, triple-loop learning questions how thesocial structures, cultural norms, dominant value structures, and other
constructs that mediate risk and risk management (see Box 1-3) mightbe changed or transformed. Extending the flood control example, triple-loop learning might entail entirely new approaches to governance andparticipatory risk management involving additional parties, crossingcultural, institutional, national, and other boundaries that contributesignificantly to flood risk, and planning aimed at robust actions instead ofstrategies considered optimal for particular constituents (Pahl-Wostl, 2009).
Different types of learning are more or less appropriate in given
circumstances (Pahl-Wostl, 2009, p. 359). For example, overrelianceon single-loop learning may be problematic in rapidly changingcircumstances. Single-loop learning draws on an inventory of existingskills and memories specific to particular circumstances. As a result,rapid, abrupt, or surprising changes may confound single-loop learningprocesses (Batterbury, 2008). Coping mechanisms, even those thathave developed over long periods of time and been tested againstobservation and experience, may not confer their usual survivaladvantage in new contexts. Double- and triple-loop learning are bettersuited to matching coping ranges with new hazard regimes (Yohe andTol, 2002). Integrating double- and triple-loop learning into adaptationprojects, particularly for populations exposed to multiple risks andstressors, is more effective than more narrowly planned approachesdependent on specific future climate information (McGray et al., 2007;Pettengell, 2010). 
Easier said than done, triple-loop learning is analogous to what some
have termed ‘transformation’ (Kysar, 2004; see Section 1.1.3; Chapter8), in that it can lead to recasting social structures, institutions, andconstructions that contain and mediate risk to accommodate more fundamental changes in world view (Pelling, 2010). Translating double-and triple-loop learning into policy requires not only articulation ofa larger risk-benefit universe, but also mechanisms to identify,account for, and compare the costs associated with a wide range ofinterventions and their benefits and harms over various time horizons.Stakeholders would need also to collaborate to an unusual degree inorder to collectively and cooperatively consider the wide range of riskmanagement possibilities and their impacts.
1.4.3. Learning to Overcome Adaptation Barriers 
Learning focused on barriers to adaptation can be particularly useful.Resource limitations are universally noted as a significant impediment inpursuing adaptation strategies, to a greater or lesser degree dependingon the context. In addition, some recent efforts to identify and categorizeadaptation barriers have focused on specific cultural factors (Nielsenand Reenberg, 2010) or issues specific to particular sectors (Huang etal., 2011), while others have discussed the topic more comprehensively(Moser and Ekstrom, 2010). Some studies identify barriers in the specificstages of the adaptation process. Moser and Ekstrom (2010), for instance,outline three phases of adaptation: understanding, planning, andmanagement. Each phase contains several key steps, and barriers canChapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience55impede progress at each. Barriers to understanding, for instance, can
include difficulty recognizing a changing signal due to difficulty with itsdetection, perception, and appreciation; preoccupation with otherpressing concerns that divert attention from the growing signal; andlack of administrative and social support for making adaptive decisions.While this study offers a diagnostic framework and avoids prescriptionsabout overcoming adaptation barriers, other studies, such as thosementioned above, offer more focused prescriptions relevant to particularsectors and contexts.
Research on barriers has generally focused on adaptation as a process,
recognizing the difficulty in furnishing a universally acceptable a priori
definition of successful adaptation outcomes (Adger et al., 2005). Thisskirts potentially important normative questions, however, and someresearchers have considered whether particular activities should beconsidered maladaptive, defined as an “action taken ostensibly to avoidor reduce vulnerability to climate change that impacts adversely on,or increases the vulnerability of other systems, sectors, or socialgroups” (Barnett and O’Neill, 2009, p. 211). They identify activitiesthat increase greenhouse gas releases, burden vulnerable populationsdisproportionately, and require excessive commitment to one path ofaction (Barnett and O’Neill, 2009). Other candidates include actions thatoffset one set of risks but increase others, resulting in net risk increase,for example, a dam that reduces flooding but increases the threat ofzoonotic diseases, and actions that amplify risk to those who remainexposed (or are newly exposed as a result of a maladaptive action), ofwhich there are abundant examples in the public health literature(Sterman, 2006) and other fields.
These issues have a long history in disaster risk management. For instance,
in 1942, deriving from study and work in the 1930s, Gilbert White assertedthat levees can provide a false sense of security and are eventuallyfallible, ultimately leading to increased risk, and advocated, amongother ‘adjustment’ measures, land use planning and environmentalmanagement schemes in river basins in order to face up to floodinghazards (see Burton et al., 1978). Such findings are among the earlyadvances in the field of ‘human adjustment to hazards,’ which derivedfrom an ecological approach to human-environmental relationships. In
the case of levees for example, the distinction between adaptive and
maladaptive actions depends on the time period over which risks are
being assessed. From a probabilistic perspective, the overall likelihoodof a catastrophic flood overwhelming a levee’s protective capacity is a
function of time. The wrinkle that climate change introduces is that
many climate-related hazards may become more frequent, shrinking the
timescale over which certain decisions can be considered ‘adaptive’ and
communities can consider themselves ‘adapted’ (Nelson et al., 2007).
While frameworks that help diagnose barriers to adaptation are helpful
in identifying the origin of maladaptive decisions, crafting truly adaptivepolicies is still difficult even when the barriers are fully exposed. For
instance, risk displacement is a common concern in large insurance
systems when risk is not continuously reassessed, risk managementstrategies and mechanisms for distributing risk across populations (suchas risk pricing in insurance schemes) are inadequately maintained, or if
new risk management strategies are not recruited as necessary. Thiswas the case with the levees in New Orleans prior to Hurricane Katrina,wherein the levees were built to make a hazardous area safer butparadoxically facilitated the exposure of a much larger population to alarge hazard. As a result of multiple factors (Burby, 2006), inadequatelevee infrastructure increased the likelihood of flooding but no otheradequate risk reduction and management measures were implemented,resulting in catastrophic loss of life and property when the city was hitwith the surge from a strong Category 3 storm (Comfort, 2006). Some havesuggested that, as a result of the U.S. federal government’s historical
approach to disasters, those whose property was at risk in New Orleans
anticipated that they would receive federal recovery funds in the event ofa flooding disaster. This, in turn, may have distorted the risk managementlandscape, resulting in improper pricing of flooding risks, decreasedincentives to take proper risk management actions, and exposure of alarger population to flood risk than might otherwise have been the case(Kunreuther, 2006). 
This example illustrates how an adaptation barrier may have resulted in
an ultimately maladaptive risk management regime, and demonstratesthe importance of considering how risk, in practice, is assumed andshared. One goal of risk sharing is to properly price risk so that, in theevent risk is realized, there is an adequate pool of capital available tofund recovery. When risk is improperly priced and risk sharing is notadequately regulated, as can occur when risk-sharing devices are notmonitored appropriately, an adequate pool of reserves may notaccumulate. When risk is realized, the responsibility for funding therecovery falls to the insurer of last resort, often the public.
The example also illustrates how an insurance system designed to
motivate adaptation (by individual homeowners or flood protectionagencies) can function properly only if technical rates – rates that properlyreflect empirically determined levels of risk – can be established andmatched with various levels of risk at a relatively high level of spatialand temporal resolution. Even in countries with free-market floodinsurance systems, insurers may be reluctant to charge the full technicalrate because consumers have come to assume that insurance costsshould be relatively consistent in a given location. Without charging
technical rates, however, it is difficult to use pricing to motivate adaptationstrategies su ch as flood proofing or elevating the ground floor of a new
development (Lamond et al., 2009), restricting where properties can be
built, or justifying the construction of communal flood defenses. In sucha case, barriers to adaptation (in both planning and management, inthis case) can result in a strategy with maladaptive consequences in thepresent. In places where risk levels are rising due to climate changeunder prevailing negative conditions of exposure and vulnerability,reconsideration of these barriers – a process that includes double- andtriple-loop learning – could promote more adaptive risk management.Otherwise, maladaptive risk management decisions may commit collec tive
resources (public or private) to coping and recovery rather than successfuladaptation and may force some segments of society to cope withdisproportionate levels of risk.
Chapter 1 Climate Change: New Dimensions in Disaster Risk, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Resilience561.4.4. ‘No Regrets,’ Robust Adaptation, and Learning
The mismatch between adaptation strategies and projected needs has
been characterized as the potential for regret, that is, opportunity costsassociated with decisions (and related path dependence, wherein earlierchoices constrain future circumstances and decisions) that are optimal
for one or a small number of possible climate futures but not necessarily
robust over a wider range of scenarios (Lempert and Schlesinger, 2001).‘No regrets’ adaptation refers to decisions that have net benefits overthe entire range of anticipated future climate and associated impacts(Callaway and Hellmuth, 2007; Heltberg et al., 2009). 
To address the challenge of risk management in the dynamically
complex context of climate change and development, as well as underconditions where probabilistic estimates of future climatic conditionsremain imprecise, several authors have advanced the concept ofrobustness (Wilby and Dessai, 2010), of which ‘no regrets’ adaptation isa special case (Lempert and Groves, 2010). Robustness is a property ofa plan or strategy that performs well over a wide range of plausiblefuture scenarios even if it does not perform optimally in any particularscenario. Robust adaptation plans may perform relatively well even ifprobabilistic assessments of risk prove wrong because they aim toaddress both expected and surprising changes, and may allow diversestakeholders to agree on actions even if they disagree about values andexpectations (Brown and Lall, 2006; Dessai and Hulme; 2007; Lempertand Groves, 2010; Means et al., 2010; see also Section 1.3.2). 
As Section 1.4.3 highlights, currently, in many instances risks associated
with extreme weather and other climate-sensitive hazards are often notwell managed. To be effective, adaptation would prioritize measuresthat increase current as well as future resilience to threats. Robustnessover time would increase if learning were a central pillar of adaptationefforts, including learning focused on addressing current vulnerabilitiesand enhancing current risk management ( high confidence ). Single-,
double-, and triple-loop learning will all improve the efficacy ofmanagement strategies.
The case studies in Chapter 9 highlight some important examples of
learning in disaster risk management relevant to a wide range of climate-
sensitive threats and a variety of sectors. Section 9.2 provides examplesof how single- and double-loop learning processes – enhancing public
health response capacity, augmenting early warning systems, andapplying known strategies for protecting health from the threat ofextreme heat in new settings – had demonstrable impacts on heat-
related mortality, quickly shifting a region’s coping range with regard to
extreme heat (Section 9.2.1). Other case studies, examining risk transfer(Section 9.2.13) and early warning systems (Section 9.2.11), provide
instances of how existing methods and tools can be modified anddeployed in new settings in response to changing risk profiles – examples
of both double- and triple-loop learning. Similarly, the case studies on
governance (Section 9.2.12) and on the limits to adaptation in smallisland developing states (Section 9.2.9) provide examples of third-loop
learning and transformative approaches to disaster risk management.References

Table of Contents67The severity of the impacts of extreme and non-extreme weather and climate events depends strongly on
the level of vulnerability and exposure to these events ( high confidence ).[2.2.1, 2.3, 2.5] Trends in vulnerability
and exposure are major drivers of changes in disaster risk, and of impacts when risk is realized ( high confidence ). [2.5]
Understanding the multi-faceted nature of vulnerability and exposure is a prerequisite for determining how weatherand climate events contribute to the occurrence of disasters, and for designing and implementing effective adaptationand disaster risk management strategies. [2.2, 2.6]
Vulnerability and exposure are dynamic, varying across temporal and spatial scales, and depend on economic,
social, geographic, demographic, cultural, institutional, governance, and environmental factors ( high
confidence ). [2.2, 2.3, 2.5] Individuals and communities are differentially exposed and vulnerable and this is based
on factors such as wealth, education, race/ethnicity/religion, gender, age, class/caste, disability, and health status. [2.5]Lack of resilience and capacity to anticipate, cope with, and adapt to extremes and change are important causal factorsof vulnerability. [2.4]
Extreme and non-extreme weather and climate events also affect vulnerability to future extreme events,
by modifying the resilience, coping, and adaptive capacity of communities, societies, or social-ecologicalsystems affected by such events ( high confidence ). [2.4.3] At the far end of the spectrum – low-probability, high-
intensity events – the intensity of extreme climate and weather events and exposure to them tend to be more pervasivein explaining disaster loss than vulnerability in explaining the level of impact. But for less extreme events – higherprobability, lower intensity – the vulnerability of exposed elements plays an increasingly important role ( high
confidence ). [2.3] The cumulative effects of small- or medium-scale, recurrent disasters at the sub-national or local
levels can substantially affect livelihood options and resources and the capacity of societies and communities toprepare for and respond to future disasters. [2.2.1, 2.7]
High vulnerability and exposure are generally the outcome of skewed development processes, such as
those associated with environmental mismanagement, demographic changes, rapid and unplannedurbanization in hazardous areas, failed governance, and the scarcity of livelihood options for the poor(high confidence ).[2.2.2, 2.5]
The selection of appropriate vulnerability and risk evaluation approaches depends on the decisionmaking
context ( high confidence ).[2.6.1] Vulnerability and risk assessment methods range from global and national
quantitative assessments to local-scale qualitative participatory approaches. The appropriateness of a specific methoddepends on the adaptation or risk management issue to be addressed, including for instance the time and geographicscale involved, the number and type of actors, and economic and governance aspects. Indicators, indices, and
probabilistic metrics are important measures and techniques for vulnerability and risk analysis. However, quantitative
approaches for assessing vulnerability need to be complemented with qualitative approaches to capture the full
complexity and the various tangible and intangible aspects of vulnerability in its different dimensions. [2.6]
Appropriate and timely risk communication is critical for effective adaptation and disaster risk management
(high confidence ). Effective risk communication is built on risk assessment, and tailored to a specific audience, which
may range from decisionmakers at various levels of government, to the private sector and the public at large, includinglocal communities and specific social groups. Explicit characterization of uncertainty and complexity strengthens risk
communication. Impediments to information flows and limited awareness are risk amplifiers. Beliefs, values, and
norms influence risk perceptions, risk awareness, and choice of action. [2.6.3]
Adaptation and risk management policies and practices will be more successful if they take the dynamic
nature of vulnerability and exposure into account, including the explicit characterization of uncertainty
and complexity at each stage of planning and practice ( medium evidence, high agreement ). However,
approaches to representing such dynamics quantitatively are currently underdeveloped. Projections of the impacts ofChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability
Executive Summary68climate change can be strengthened by including storylines of changing vulnerability and exposure under different
development pathways. Appropriate attention to the temporal and spatial dynamics of vulnerability and exposure isparticularly important given that the design and implementation of adaptation and risk management strategies andpolicies can reduce risk in the short term, but may increase vulnerability and exposure over the longer term. Forinstance, dike systems can reduce hazard exposure by offering immediate protection, but also encourage settlementpatterns that may increase risk in the long term. [2.4.2.1, 2.5.4.2, 2.6.2]
Vulnerability reduction is a core common element of adaptation and disaster risk management ( high
confidence ). Vulnerability reduction thus constitutes an important common ground between the two areas of policy
and practice. [2.2, 2.3]Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability692.1. Introduction and Scope
Many climate change adaptation efforts aim to address the implications
of potential changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of weatherand climate events that affect the risk of extreme impacts on humansociety. That risk is determined not only by the climate and weather
events (the hazards) but also by the exposure and vulnerability to these
hazards. Therefore, effective adaptation and disaster risk managementstrategies and practices also depend on a rigorous understanding of thedimensions of exposure and vulnerability, as well as a proper assessmentof changes in those dimensions. This chapter aims to provide thatunderstanding and assessment, by further detailing the determinants ofrisk as presented in Chapter 1.
The first sections of this chapter elucidate the concepts that are needed
to define and understand risk, and show that risk originates from acombin ation of social processes and their interaction with the environment
(Sections 2.2 and 2.3), and highlight the role of coping and adaptivecapacities (Section 2.4). The following section (2.5) describes the differentdimensions of vulnerability and exposure as well as trends therein.Given that exposure and vulnerability are highly context-specific, thissection is by definition limited to a general overview (a more quantitativeperspective on trends is provided in Chapter 4). A methodologicaldiscussion (Section 2.6) of approaches to identify and assess risk providesindications of how the dimensions of exposure and vulnerability can beexplored in specific contexts, such as adaptation planning, and thecentral role of risk perception and risk communication. The chapterconcludes with a cross-cutting discussion of risk accumulation and thenature of disasters (Section 2.7).
2.2. Defining Determinants of Risk:
Hazard, Exposure, and Vulnerability
2.2.1. Disaster Risk and Disaster
Disaster risk signifies the possibility of adverse effects in the future. It
derives from the interaction of social and environmental processes, from
the combination of physical hazards and the vulnerabilities of exposedelements (see Chapter 1). The hazard event is not the sole driver of risk,
and there is high confidence that the levels of adverse effects are in
good part determined by the vulnerability and exposure of societies and
social-ecological systems (UNDRO, 1980; Cuny, 1984; Cardona, 1986,1993, 2011; Davis and Wall, 1992; UNISDR, 2004, 2009b; Birkmann,2006a,b; van Aalst 2006a).
Disaster risk is not fixed but is a continuum in constant evolution. A
disaster is one of its many ‘moments’ (ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b), signifying
unmanaged risks that often serve to highlight skewed development
problems (Westgate and O’Keefe, 1976; Wijkman and Timberla ke, 1984).
Disasters may also be seen as the materialization of risk and signify ‘abecoming real’ of this latent condition that is in itself a social construction
(see below; Renn, 1992; Adam and Van Loon, 2000; Beck, 2000, 2008).Disaster risk is associated with differing levels and types of adverse
effects. The effects may assume catastrophic levels or levels commensuratewith small disasters. Some have limited financial costs but very highhuman costs in terms of loss of life and numbers of people affected;others have very high financial costs but relatively limited human costs.Furthermore, there is high confidence that the cumulative effects of
small disasters can affect capacities of communities, societies, or social-
ecological systems to deal with future disasters at sub-national or locallevels (Alexander, 1993, 2000; Quarantelli, 1998; Birkmann, 2006b;Marulanda et al., 2008b, 2010, 2011; UNISDR, 2009a).
2.2.2. The Factors of Risk
As detailed in Section 1.1, hazard refers to the possible, future occurrence
of natural or human-induced physical events that may have adverseeffects on vulnerable and exposed elements (White, 1973; UNDRO,1980; Cardona, 1990; UNDHA, 1992; Birkmann, 2006b). Although, attimes, hazard has been ascribed the same meaning as risk, currently itis widely accepted that it is a component of risk and not risk itself.The intensity or recurrence of hazard events can be partly determinedby environmental degradation and human intervention in naturalecosystems. Landslides or flooding regimes associated with human-induced environmental alteration and new climate change-relatedhazards are examples of such socio-natural hazards (Lavell, 1996,1999a).
Exposure refers to the inventory of elements in an area in which hazard
events may occur (Cardona, 1990; UNISDR, 2004, 2009b). Hence, ifpopulation and economic resources were not located in (exposed to)potentially dangerous settings, no problem of disaster risk would exist.While the literature and common usage often mistakenly conflateexposure and vulnerability, they are distinct. Exposure is a necessary,but not sufficient, determinant of risk. It is possible to be exposedbut not vulnerable (for example by living in a floodplain but havingsufficient means to modify building structure and behavior to mitigatepotential loss). However, to be vulnerable to an extreme event, it isnecessary to also be exposed. 
Land use and territorial planning are key factors in risk reduction. The
environment offers resources for human development at the sametime as it represents exposure to intrinsic and fluctuating hazardousconditions. Population dynamics, diverse demands for location, andthe gradual decrease in the availability of safer lands mean it isalmost inevitable that humans and human endeavor will be located inpotentially dangerous places (Lavell, 2003). Where exposure to events isimpossible to avoid, land use planning and location decisions can beaccompanied by other structural or non-structural methods for preventingor mitigating risk (UNISDR, 2009a; ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b).
Vulnerability refers to the propensity of exposed elements such as
human beings, their livelihoods, and assets to suffer adverse effectswhen impacted by hazard events (UNDRO, 1980; Cardona, 1986, 1990,Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability701993; Liverman, 1990; Maskrey, 1993b; Cannon, 1994, 2006; Blaikie et
al., 1996; Weichselgartner, 2001; Bogardi and Birkmann, 2004; UNISDR,2004, 2009b; Birkmann, 2006b; Janssen et al., 2006; Thywissen, 2006).Vulnerability is related to predisposition, susceptibilities, fragilities,weaknesses, deficiencies, or lack of capacities that favor adverse effectson the exposed elements. Thywissen (2006) and Manyena (2006) car-ried out an extensive review of the terminology. The former includes along list of definitions used for the term vulnerability and the latterincludes definitions of vulnerability and resilience and their relationship. 
An early view of vulnerability in the context of disaster risk management
was related to the physical resistance of engineering structures (UNDHA,1992), but more recent views relate vulnerability to characteristics ofsocial and environmental processes. It is directly related, in the contextof climate change, to the susceptibility, sensitivity, and lack of resilienceor capacities of the exposed system to cope with and adapt to extremesand non-extremes (Luers et al., 2003; Schröter et al., 2005; Brklacichand Bohle, 2006; IPCC, 2001, 2007). 
While vulnerability is a key concept for both disaster risk and climate
change adaptation, the term is employed in numerous other contexts,for instance to refer to epidemiological and psychological fragilities,ecosystem sensitivity, or the conditions, circumstances, and drivers thatmake people vulnerable to natural and economic stressors (Kaspersonet al., 1988; Cutter, 1994; Wisner et al., 2004; Brklacich and Bohle, 2006;Haines et al., 2006; Villagrán de León, 2006). It is common to findblanket descriptions of the elderly, children, or women as ‘vulnerable,’without any indication as to what these groups are vulnerable to(Wisner, 1993; Enarson and Morrow, 1998; Morrow, 1999; Bankoff,2004; Cardona, 2004, 2011). 
Vulnerability can be seen as situation-specific, interacting with a hazard
event to generate risk (Lavell, 2003; Cannon, 2006; Cutter et al., 2008).Vulnerability to financial crisis, for example, does not infer vulnerabilityto climate change or natural hazards. Similarly, a population might bevulnerable to hurricanes, but not to landslides or floods. From a climatechange perspective, basic environmental conditions change progressivelyand then induce new risk conditions for societies. For example, more
frequent and intense events may introduce factors of risk into new
areas, revealing underlying vulnerability. In fact, future vulnerability isembedded in the present conditions of the communities that may beexposed in the future (Patt et al., 2005, 2009); that is, new hazards in
areas not previously subject to them will reveal, not necessarily create,
underlying vulnerability factors (Alwang et al., 2001; Cardona et al.,2003a; Lopez-Calva and Ortiz, 2008; UNISDR, 2009a).
While vulnerability is in general hazard-specific, certain factors, such as
poverty, and the lack of social networks and social support mechanisms,will aggravate or affect vulnerability levels irrespective of the type ofhazard. These types of generic factors are different from the hazard-
specific factors and assume a different position in the intervention
actions and the nature of risk management and adaptation processes(ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b). Vulnerability of human settlements and ecosystemsis intrinsically tied to different socio-cultural and environmental
processes (Kasperson et al., 1988; Cutter, 1994; Adger, 2006; Cutter andFinch, 2008; Cutter et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2008; Décamps, 2010;Dawson et al., 2011). Vulnerability is linked also to deficits in riskcommunication, especially the lack of appropriate information that canlead to false risk perceptions (Birkmann and Fernando, 2008), whichhave an important influence on the motivation and perceived ability toact or to adapt to climate change and environmental stressors(Grothmann and Patt, 2005). Additionally, processes of maladaptationor unsustainable adaptation can increase vulnerability and risks(Birkmann, 2011a). 
Vulnerability in the context of disaster risk management is the most
palpable manifestation of the social construction of risk (Aysan, 1993;Blaikie et al., 1996; Wisner et al., 2004; ICSU-LAC 2010a,b). This notion
underscores that society, in its interaction with the changing physical
world, constructs disaster risk by transforming physical events intohazards of different intensities or magnitudes through social processesthat increase the exposure and vulnerability of population groups, theirlivelihoods, production, support infrastructure, and services (Chambers,1989; Wilches-Chaux, 1989; Cannon, 1994; Wisner et al., 2004; Wisner,2006a; Carreño et al., 2007a; ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b). This includes:
•How human action influences the levels of exposure andvulnerability in the face of different physical events
•How human intervention in the environment leads to the creationof new hazards or an increase in the levels or damage potential ofexisting ones
•How human perception, understanding, and assimilation of thefactors of risk influence societal reactions, prioritization, anddecisionmaking processes. 
There is high agreement androbust evidence that high vulnerability and
exposure are mainly an outcome of skewed development processes,including those associated with environmental mismanagement,demographic changes, rapid and unplanned urbanization, and the scarcityof livelihood options for the poor (Maskrey, 1993a,b, 1994, 1998; Mansilla,1996; Lavell, 2003; Cannon, 2006; ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b; Cardona, 2011). 
Increases in disaster risk and the occurrence of disasters have been in
evidence over the last five decades (Munich Re, 2011) (see Section 1.1.1).This trend may continue and may be enhanced in the future as a resultof projected climate change, further demographic and socioeconomicchanges, and trends in governance, unless concerted actions are enactedto reduce vulnerability and to adapt to climate change, includinginterventions to address disaster risks (Lavell, 1996, 1999a, 2003; ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b; UNISDR, 2011). 
2.3. The Drivers of Vulnerability
In order to effectively manage risk, it is essential to understand howvulnerability is generated, how it increases, and how it builds up(Maskrey, 1989; Cardona, 1996a, 2004, 2011; Lavell, 1996, 1999a;Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability71O’Brien et al., 2004b). Vulnerability describes a set of conditions of
people that derive from the historical and prevailing cultural, social,environmental, political, and economic contexts. In this sense, vulnerablegroups are not only at risk because they are exposed to a hazard but asa result of marginality, of everyday patterns of social interaction andorganization, and access to resources (Watts and Bohle, 1993; Morrow,1999; Bankoff, 2004). Thus, the effects of a disaster on any particularhousehold result from a complex set of drivers and interacting conditions.It is important to keep in mind that people and communities are notonly or mainly victims, but also active managers of vulnerability (Ribot,1996; Pelling, 1997, 2003). Therefore, integrated and multidimensionalapproaches are highly important to understanding causes of vulnerability. 
Some global processes are significant drivers of risk and are particularly
related to vulnerability creation. There is high confidence that these
include population growth, rapid and inappropriate urban development,international financial pressures, increases in socioeconomic inequalities,trends and failures in governance (e.g., corruption, mismanagement),and environmental degradation (Maskrey, 1993a,b, 1994, 1998; Mansilla,1996; Cannon, 2006). Vulnerability profiles can be constructed that takeinto consideration sources of environmental, social, and economicmarginality (Wisner, 2003). This also includes the consideration of thelinks between communities and specific environmental services, and thevulnerability of ecosystem components (Renaud, 2006; Williams et al.,2008; Décamps, 2010; Dawson et al., 2011). In climate change-relatedimpact assessments, integration of underlying ‘causes of vulnerability’and adaptive capacity is needed rather than focusing on technicalaspects only (Ribot, 1995; O’Brien et al., 2004b).
Due to different conceptual frameworks and definitions, as well as
disciplinary views, approaches to address the causes of vulnerabilityalso differ (Burton et al., 1983; Blaikie et al., 1994; Harding et al., 2001;Twigg, 2001; Adger and Brooks, 2003, 2006; Turner et al., 2003a,b;Cardona, 2004; Schröter et al., 2005; Adger 2006; Füssel and Klein, 2006;Villagrán de León, 2006; Cutter and Finch, 2008; Cutter et al., 2008).Thomalla et al. (2006), Mitchell and van Aalst (2008), and Mitchell et al.(2010) examine commonalities and differences between the adaptationto climate change and disaster risk management communities, and
identify key areas of difference and convergence. The two communities
tend to perceive the nature and timescale of the threat differently:
impacts due to climate change and return periods for extreme eventsfrequently use the language of uncertainty; but considerable knowledge
and certainty has been expressed regarding event characteristics andexposures related to extreme historical environmental conditions. 
Four approaches to understanding vulnerability and its causes can be
distinguished, rooted in political economy, social-ecology, vulnerability,
and disaster risk assessment, as well as adaptation to climate change:
1)The pressure and release (PAR) model (Blaikie et al., 1994, 1996;Wisner et al., 2004) is common to social science-related vulnerabilityresearch and emphasizes the social conditions and root causes ofexposure more than the hazard as generating unsafe conditions.
This approach links vulnerability to unsafe conditions in a continuumthat connects local vulnerability to wider national and global shifts
in the political economy of resources and political power.
2)The social ecology perspective emphasizes the need to focus oncoupled human-environmental systems (Hewitt and Burton, 1971;Turner et al., 2003a,b). This perspective stresses the ability ofsocieties to transform nature and also the implications of changesin the environment for social and economic systems. It argues thatthe exposure and susceptibility of a system can only be adequatelyunderstood if these coupling processes and interactions areaddressed. 
3)Holistic perspectives on vulnerability aim to go beyond technicalmodeling to embrace a wider and comprehensive explanation ofvulnerability. These approaches differentiate exposure, susceptibilityand societal response capacities as causes or factors of vulnerability(see Cardona, 1999a, 2001, 2011; Cardona and Barbat, 2000;Cardona and Hurtado, 2000a,b; IDEA, 2005; Birkmann, 2006b;Carreño, 2006; Carreño et al.,2007a,b, 2009; Birkmann and Fernando,2008). A core element of these approaches is the feedback loopwhich underlines that vulnerability is dynamic and is the maindriver and determinant of current or future risk.
4)In the context of climate change adaptation, different vulnerabilitydefinitions and concepts have been developed and discussed. Oneof the most prominent definitions is the one reflected in the IPCCFourth Assessment Report, which describes vulnerability as afunction of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, as alsoreflected by, for instance, McCarthy et al. (2001), Brooks (2003),K. O’Brien et al. (2004a), Füssel and Klein (2006), Füssel (2007),and G. O’Brien et al. (2008). This approach differs from theunderstanding of vulnerability in the disaster risk managementperspective, as the rate and magnitude of climate change isconsidered. The concept of vulnerability here includes externalenvironmental factors of shock or stress. Therefore, in this view, themagnitude and frequency of potential hazard events is to beconsidered in the vulnerability to climate change. This view alsodiffers in its focus upon long-term trends and stresses rather thanon current shock forecasting, something not explicitly excluded butrather rarely considered within the disaster risk managementapproaches. 
The lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework that facilitates a
common multidisciplinary risk evaluation impedes the effectiveness ofdisaster risk management and adaptation to climate change (Cardona,2004). The option for anticipatory disaster risk reduction and adaptationexists precisely because risk is a latent condition, which announcespotential future adverse effects (Lavell, 1996, 1999a). Understandingdisaster risk management as a social process allows for a shift in focusfrom responding to the disaster event toward an understanding ofdisaster risk (Cardona and Barbat, 2000; Cardona et al., 2003a). Thisrequires knowledge about how human interactions with the naturalenvironment lead to the creation of new hazards, and how persons,property, infrastructure, goods, and the environment are exposed topotentially damaging events. Furthermore, it requires an understandingof the vulnerability of people and their livelihoods, including theChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability72allocation and distribution of social and economic resources that can work
for or against the achievement of resistance, resilience, and security (ICSU-
LAC, 2010a,b). Overall, there is high confidence that although hazard
events are usually considered the cause of disaster risk, vulnerability
and exposure are its key determining factors. Furthermore, contrary tothe hazard, vulnerability and exposure can often be influenced by policy
and practice, including in the short to medium term. Therefore disasterrisk management and adaptation strategies have to address mainlythese same risk factors (Cardona 1999a, 2011; Vogel and O’Brien, 2004;Birkmann, 2006a; Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008).
Despite various frameworks developed for defining and assessing
vulnerability, it is interesting to note that at least some common causalfactors of vulnerability have been identified, in both the disaster riskmanagement and climate change adaptation communities (seeCardona, 1999b, 2001, 2011; Cardona and Barbat, 2000; Cardona andHurtado, 2000a,b; McCarthy et al., 2001; Gallopin, 2006; Manyena,2006; Carreño et al., 2007a, 2009; IPCC, 2007; ICSU-LAC 2010a,b;MOVE, 2010):
•Susceptibility/fragility (in disaster risk management) or sensitivity(in climate change adaptation) : physical predisposition of human
beings, infrastructure, and environment to be affected by a dangerousphenomenon due to lack of resistance and predisposition of societyand ecosystems to suffer harm as a consequence of intrinsic andcontext conditions making it plausible that such systems onceimpacted will collapse or experience major harm and damage dueto the influence of a hazard event.
•Lack of resilience (in disaster risk management) or lack of copingand adaptive capacities (in climate change adaptation) : limitations
in access to and mobilization of the resources of the human beingsand their institutions, and incapacity to anticipate, adapt, andrespond in absorbing the socio-ecological and economic impact. 
There is high confidence that at the extreme end of the spectrum, the
intensity of extreme climate and weather events – low-probability,high-intensity – and exposure to them tend to be more pervasive inexplaining disaster loss than vulnerability itself. But as the events getless extreme – higher-probability, lower-intensity – the vulnerability of
exposed elements plays an increasingly important role in explaining the
level of impact. Vulnerability is a major cause of the increasing adverseeffects of non-extreme events, that is, small recurrent disasters thatmany times are not visible at the national or sub-national level
(Marulanda et al., 2008b, 2010, 2011; UNISDR, 2009a; Cardona, 2011;UNISDR, 2011).
Overall, the promotion of resilient and adaptive societies requires a
paradigm shift away from the primary focus on natural hazards andextreme weather events toward the identification, assessment, and
ranking of vulnerability (Maskrey, 1993a; Lavell, 2003; Birkmann,2006a,b). Therefore, understanding vulnerability is a prerequisite for
understanding risk and the development of risk reduction and adaptationstrategies to extreme events in the light of climate change (ICSU-LAC,
2010a,b; MOVE, 2010; Cardona, 2011; UNISDR, 2011).2.4. Coping and Adaptive Capacities
Capacity is an important element in most conceptual frameworks ofvulnerability and risk. It refers to the positive features of people’scharacteristics that may reduce the risk posed by a certain hazard.Improving capacity is often identified as the target of policies and projects,
based on the notion that strengthening capacity will eventually lead to
reduced risk. Capacity clearly also matters for reducing the impact ofclimate change (e.g., Sharma and Patwardhan, 2008).
As presented in Chapter 1, coping is typically used to refer to ex post
actions, while adaptation is normally associated with ex ante actions.
This implies that coping capacity also refers to the ability to react to andreduce the adverse effects of experienced hazards, whereas adaptivecapacity refers to the ability to anticipate and transform structure,functioning, or organization to better survive hazards (Saldaña-Zorrilla,2007). Presence of capacity suggests that impacts will be less extremeand/or the recovery time will be shorter, but high capacity to recoverdoes not guarantee equal levels of capacity to anticipate. In otherwords, the capacity to cope does not infer the capacity to adapt(Birkmann, 2011a), although coping capacity is often considered tobe part of adaptive capacity (Levina and Tirpak, 2006). 
2.4.1. Capacity and Vulnerability
Most risk studies prior to the 1990s focused mainly on hazards,whereas the more recent reversal of this paradigm has placed equalfocus on the vulnerability side of the equation. Emphasizing that riskcan be reduced through vulnerability is an acknowledgement of thepower of social, political, environmental, and economic factors in drivingrisk. While these factors drive risk on one hand, they can on the otherhand be the source of capacity to reduce it (Carreño et al., 2007a;Gaillard, 2010). 
Many approaches for assessing vulnerability rely on an assessment of
capacity as a baseline for understanding how vulnerable people are toa specific hazard. The relationship between capacity and vulnerabilityis described differently among different schools of thought, stemmingfrom different uses in the fields of development, disaster riskmanagement, and climate change adaptation. Gaillard (2010) notesthat the concept of capacity “played a pivotal role in the progressiveemergence of the vulnerability paradigm within the scientific realm.”On the whole, the literature describes the relationship betweenvulnerability and capacity in two ways, which are not mutually exclusive(Bohle, 2001; IPCC, 2001; Moss et al., 2001; Yodmani, 2001; Downingand Patwardhan, 2004; Brooks et al., 2005; Smit and Wandel, 2006;Gaillard, 2010):
1)Vulnerability is, among other things, the result of a lack ofcapacity.
2)Vulnerability is the opposite of capacity, so that increasing capacity means reducing vulnerability, and high vulnerabilitymeans low capacity.Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability73The relationship between capacity and vulnerability is interpreted
differently in the climate change community of practice and the
disaster risk management community of practice. Throughout the
1980s, vulnerability became a central focus of much work on disasters,in some circles overshadowing the role played by hazards in driving risk.
Some have noted that the emphasis on vulnerability tended to ignore
capacity, focusing too much on the negative aspects of vulnerability
(Davis et al., 2004). Recognizing the role of capacity in reducing risk alsoindicates an acknowledgement that people are not ‘helpless victims’
(Bohle, 2001; Gaillard, 2010).In many climate change-related studies, capacity was initially subsumed
under vulnerability. The first handbooks and guidelines for adaptationemphasized impacts and vulnerability assessment as the necessary stepsfor determining adaptation options (Kate, 1985; Carter et al ., 1994; Benioff
et al., 1996; Feenstra et al., 1998). Climate change vulnerability was oftenplaced in direct opposition to capacity. Vulnerability that was measuredwas seen as the remainder after capacity had been taken into account.
However, Davis et al. (2004), IDEA (2005), Carreño et al. (2007a,b), and
Gaillard (2010) note that capacity and vulnerability are not necessarilyChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability
Box 2-1 | Coping and Adaptive Capacity: Different Origins and Uses
As set out in Section 1.4, there is a difference in understanding and use of the terms coping and adapting. Although coping cap acity is
often used interchangeably with adaptive capacity in the climate change literature, Cutter et al. (2008) point out that adaptiv e capacity
features more frequently in global environmental change perspectives and is less prevalent in the hazards discourse.
Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of a system or individual to adapt to climate change, but it can also be used in the co ntext of
disaster risk. Because adaptive capacity is considered to determine “the ability of an individual, family, community, or other social group
to adjust to changes in the environment guaranteeing survival and sustainability” (Lavell, 1999b), many believe that in the con text of
uncertain environmental changes, adaptive capacity will be of key significance. Dayton-Johnson (2004) defines adaptive capacity  as the
“vulnerability of a society before disaster strikes and its resilience after the fact.” Some ways of classifying adaptive capac ity include
‘baseline adaptive capacity’ (Dore and Etkin, 2003), which refers to the capacity that allows countries to adapt to existing cl imate
variability, and ‘socially optimal adaptive capacity,’ which is determined by the norms and rules in individual locations. Anot her definition
of adaptive capacity is the “property of a system to adjust its characteristics or behavior, in order to expand its coping rang e under
existing climate variability, or future climate conditions” (Brooks and Adger, 2004). This links adaptive capacity to coping ca pacity,
because coping range is synonymous with coping capacity, referring to the boundaries of systems’ ability to cope (Yohe and Tol,  2002).
In simple terms, coping capacity refers to the “ability of people, organizations, and systems, using available skills and resou rces, to face
and manage adverse conditions, emergencies, or disasters” (UNISDR, 2009b). Coping capacity is typically used in humanitarian di scourse
to indicate the extent to which a system can survive the impacts of an extreme event. It suggests that people can deal with som e
degree of destabilization, and acknowledges that at a certain point this capacity may be exceeded. Eriksen et al. (2005) link c oping
capacity to entitlements – the set of commodity bundles that can be commanded – during an adverse event. The ability to mobiliz e this
capacity in an emergency is the manifestation of coping strategies (Gaillard, 2010). Furthermore, Birkmann (2011b) underscores that
differences between coping and adaptation are also linked to the quality of the response process. While coping aims to maintain  the
system and its functions in the face of adverse conditions, adaptation involves changes and requires reorganization processes.
The capacity described by the disasters community in the past decades does not frequently distinguish between ‘coping’ or ‘adap tive’
capacities, and instead the term is used to indicate positive characteristics or circumstances that could be seen to offset vul nerability
(Anderson and Woodrow, 1989). Because the approach is focused on disasters, it has been associated with the immediate-term copi ng
needs, and contrasts from the long-term perspective generally discussed in the context of climate change, where the aim is to a dapt to
changes rather than to just overcome them. There has been considerable discussion throughout the vulnerability and poverty and climate
change scholarly communities about whether coping strategies are a stepping stone toward adaptation, or may lead to maladaptati on
(Yohe and Tol, 2002; Eriksen et al., 2005) (see Chapter 1). Useful alternative terminology is to talk about ‘capacity to change  and adjust’
(Nelson and Finan, 2009) for adaptive capacity, and ‘capacity to absorb’ instead of coping capacity (Cutter et al., 2008). 
In the climate change community of practice, adaptive capacity has been at the forefront of thinking regarding how to respond t o the
impacts of climate change, but it was initially seen as a characteristic to build interventions on, and only later has been rec ognized as
the target of interventions (Adger et al., 2004). The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for instance, stat es in its
ultimate objective that action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions be guided by the time needed for ecosystems to adapt naturall y to
the impacts of climate change. 74opposites, because communities that are highly vulnerable may in fact
display high capacity in certain aspects. This reflects the many elementsof risk reduction and the multiple capacity needs across them. Alwanget al. (2001) also underscore that vulnerability is dynamic and determinedby numerous factors, thus high capacity in the ability to respond to anextreme event does not accurately reflect low vulnerability. 
2.4.2. Different Capacity Needs
The capacity necessary to anticipate and avoid being affected by anextreme event requires different assets, opportunities, social networks,and local and external institutions from capacity to deal with impactsand recover from them (Lavell, 1994; Lavell and Franco, 1996; Cardona,
2001, 2010; Carreño et al., 2007a,b; ICSU-LAC, 2010a,b; MOVE, 2010).
Capacity to change relies on yet another set of factors. Importantly,however, these dimensions of capacity are not unrelated to each other:the ability to change is also necessary for risk reduction and responsecapacities.
Just like vulnerability, capacity is dynamic and will change depending
on circumstances. The discussion in Box 2-1 indicates that there arediffering perspectives on how coping and adaptive capacity relate.When coping and adapting are viewed as different, it follows that thecapacity needs for each are also different (Cooper et al., 2008). Thissuggests that work done to understand the drivers of adaptive ex ante
capacity (Leichenko and O’Brien, 2002; Yohe and Tol, 2002; Brenkert andMalone, 2005; Brooks et al., 2005; Haddad, 2005; Vincent, 2007; Sharmaand Patwardhan, 2008; Magnan, 2010) may not be similar with theidentified drivers of capacities that helped in the past ( ex post ) and are
associated more closely with experienced coping processes. Many ofthese elements are reflected in local, national, and internationalcontexts in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of this Special Report.
2.4.2.1. Capacity to Anticipate Risk
Having the capacity to reduce the risk posed by hazards and changesimplies that people’s ability to manage is not engulfed, so they are not
left significantly worse off. Reducing risk means that people do not have
to devote substantial resources to dealing with a hazard as it occurs, butinstead have the capacity to anticipate this sort of event. This is the typeof capacity that is necessary in order to adapt to climate change, andinvolves conscious, planned efforts to reduce risk. The capacity to reducerisk also depends on ex post actions, which involve making choices after
one event that reduce the impact of future events. 
Capacity for risk prevention and reduction may be understood as a
series of elements, measures, and tools directed toward intervention in
hazards and vulnerabilities with the objective of reducing existing orcontrolling future possible risks (Cardona et al., 2003a). This can rangefrom guaranteeing survival to the ability to secure future livelihoods
(Batterbury, 2001; Eriksen and Silva, 2009).Development planning, including land use and urban planning, river basin
and land management, hazard-resistant building codes, and landscapedesign are all activities that can reduce exposure and vulnerability tohazards and change (Cardona, 2001, 2010). The ability to carry these outin an effective way is part of the capacity to reduce risk. Other activitiesinclude diversifying income sources, maintaining social networks, andcollective action to avoid development that puts people at higher risk(Maskrey, 1989, 1994; Lavell, 1994, 1999b, 2003). 
Up to the early 1990s, disaster preparedness and humanitarian response
dominated disaster practice, and focus on capacity was limited tounderstanding inherent response capacity. Thus, emphasizing capacity toreduce risk was not a priority. However, in the face of growing evidenceas to significant increases in disaster losses and the inevitable increasein financial and human resources dedicated to disaster response andrecovery, there is an increasing recognition of the need to promote thecapacity for prevention and risk reduction over time (Lavell, 1994, 1999b,2003). Notwithstanding, different actors, stakeholders, and interestsinfluence the capacity to anticipate a disaster. Actions to reduce exposureand vulnerability of one group of people may come at the cost ofincreasing it for another, for example when flood risks are shifted fromupstream communities to downstream communities through large-scale upstream dike construction (Birkmann, 2011a). Consequently, itis not sufficient to evaluate the success of adaptation or capacitiesto reduce risk by focusing on the objectives of one group only. Theevaluation of success of adaptation strategies depends on the spatialand temporal scale used (Adger et al., 2005).
2.4.2.2. Capacity to Respond
Capacity to respond is relevant both ex post and ex ante , since it
encompasses everything necessary to be able to react once an extremeevent takes place. Response capacity is mostly used to refer to theability of institutions to react following a natural hazard, in particularex post during emergency response. However, effective response
requires substantial ex ante planning and investments in disaster
preparedness and early warning (not only in terms of financial cost butparticularly in terms of awareness raising and capacity building; IFRC,2009). Furthermore, there are also response phases for gradual changesin ecosystems or temperature regimes caused by climate change.Responding spans everything from people’s own initial reactions to ahazard upon its impact to actions to try to reduce secondary damage. Itis worth noting that in climate change literature, anticipatory actionsare often referred to as responses, which differs from the way this termis used in the context of disaster risk, where it only implies the actionstaken once there has been an impact.
Capacity to respond is not sufficient to reduce risk. Humanitarian aid
and relief interventions have been discussed in the context of their rolein reinforcing or even amplifying existing vulnerabilities (Anderson andWoodrow, 1991; Wisner, 2001a; Schipper and Pelling, 2006). This doesnot only have implications for the capacity to respond, but also for otherChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability75aspects of capacity. Wisner (2001a) shows how poorly constructed
shelters, where people were placed temporarily in El Salvador followingHurricane Mitch in 1998, turned into ‘permanent’ housing whennongovernmental organization (NGO) support ran out. When twostrong earthquakes hit in January and February 2001, the shelterscollapsed, leaving the people homeless again. This example illustratesthe perils associated with emergency measures that focus only onresponding, rather than on the capacity to reduce risk and change.Response capacity is also differential (Chatterjee, 2010). The mosteffective ex ante risk management strategies will often include a
combination of risk reduction and enhanced capacity to respond toimpacts (including smarter response by better preparedness and earlywarning, as well risk transfer such as insurance). 
2.4.2.3. Capacity to Recover and Change 
Having the capacity to change is a requirement in order to adapt toclimate change. Viewing adaptation as requiring transformation impliesthat it cannot be understood as only a set of actions that physicallyprotect people from natural hazards (Pelling, 2010). In the context ofnatural hazards, the opportunity for changing is often greatest during therecovery phase, when physical infrastructure has to be rebuilt and can beimproved, and behavioral patterns and habits can be contemplated(Susman et al., 1983; Renn, 1992; Comfort et al., 1999; Vogel and O’Brien,2004; Birkmann et al., 2010a). This is an opportunity to rethink whetherthe crops planted are the most suited to the climate and whether it isworthwhile rebuilding hotels near the coast, taking into account whatother sorts of environmental changes may occur in the area. 
Capacity to recover is not only dependent on the extent of a physical
impact, but also on the extent to which society has been affected,including the ability to resume livelihood activities (Hutton and Haque,2003). This capacity is driven by numerous factors, including mental andphysical ability to recover, financial and environmental viability, andpolitical will. Because reconstruction processes often do not takepeople’s livelihoods into account, instead focusing on their safety, newsettlements are often located where people do not want to be, which
brings change – but not necessarily change that leads to sustainabledevelopment. Innumerable examples indicate how people who have beenresettled return back to their original location, moving into dilapidated
houses or setting up new housing, even if more solid housing isavailable elsewhere (e.g., El Salvador after Hurricane Mitch), simplybecause the new location does not allow them easy access to theirfields, to markets or roads, or to the sea (e.g., South and Southeast Asiaafter the 2004 tsunami). 
Recovering to return to the conditions before a natural hazard occurs
not only implies that the risk may be the same or greater, but also does
not question whether the previous conditions were desirable. In fact,
recovery processes are often out of sync with the evolving process ofdevelopment. The recovery and reconstruction phases after a disaster
provide an opportunity to rethink previous conditions and address theroot causes of risk, looking to avoid reconstructing the vulnerability
(IDB, 2007), but often the process is too rushed to enable effectivereflection, discussion, and consensus building (Christoplos, 2006).Pushing the recovery toward transformation and change requires takinga new approach rather than returning to ‘normalcy.’ Several exampleshave shown that capacity to recover is severely limited by poverty(Chambers, 1983; Ingham, 1993; Hutton and Haque, 2003), wherepeople are driven further down the poverty spiral, never returning to
their previous conditions, however undesirable.
The various capacities to respond and to survive hazard events and
changes have also been discussed within the context of the concept ofresilience. While originally, the concept of resilience was strongly linkedto an environmental perspective on ecosystems and their ability tomaintain major functions even in times of adverse conditions and crises(Holling, 1973), the concept has undergone major shifts and has beenenhanced and applied also in the field of social-ecological systems anddisaster risk (Gunderson, 2000; Walker et al., 2004; UN, 2005; Abel et al.,2006). Folke (2006) differentiates three different resilience conceptsthat encompass an engineering resilience perspective that focuses onrecovery and constancy issues, while the ecological and social resiliencefocus on persistence and robustness and, finally, the integrated social-ecological resilience perspective deals with adaptive capacity, trans-formability, learning, and innovation (Fol ke, 2006). In disaster risk
reduction the terms resilience building and the lack of resilience haveachieved a high recognition. These terms are linked to capacities ofcommunities or societies to deal with the impact of a hazard eventor crises and the ability to learn and create resilience through theseexperiences. Recent papers, however, also criticize the unconsidered useor the simply transfer of the concept of resilience into the wider contextof adaptation (see, e.g., Cannon and Müller-Mahn, 2010). Additionally,the lack of resilience has also been used as an umbrella to examinedeficiencies in capacities that communities encompass in order to dealwith hazard events. Describing the lack of resilience, Cardona andBarbat (2000) identify various capacities that are often insufficient insocieties that suffer heavily during disasters, such as the deficienciesregarding the capacity to anticipate, to cope with, and to adapt tochanging environmental conditions and natural hazards. 
Other work has argued a different view on resilience, because the very
occurrence of a disaster shows that there are gaps in the developmentprocess (UNDP , 2004). Lessons learned from studying the impacts of the2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (Thomalla et al., 2009; Thomalla and Larsen,2010) are informative for climate-related hazards. They suggest that: 
•Social vulnerability to multiple hazards, particularly rare extremeevents, tends to be poorly understood. 
•There is an increasing focus away from vulnerability assessmenttoward resilience building; however, resilience is poorly understoodand a lot needs to be done to go from theory to practice. 
•One of the key issues in sub-national risk reduction initiatives is aneed to better define the roles and responsibilities of governmentand NGO actors and to improve coordination between them. Withoutmechanisms for joint target setting, coordination, monitoring, andChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability76evaluation, there is much duplication of effort, competition, and
tension between actors.
•Risk reduction is only meaningful and prioritized by local governmentauthorities if it is perceived to be relevant in the context of other,more pressing day-to-day issues, such as poverty reduction,livelihood improvement, natural resource management, andcommunity development. 
2.4.3. Factors of Capacity: Drivers and Barriers 
There is high confidence that extreme and non-extreme weather and
climate events also affect vulnerability to future extreme events, bymodifying the resilience, coping, and adaptive capacity of communities,societies, or social-ecological systems affected by such events. When
people repeatedly have to respond to natural hazards and changes, the
capitals that sustain capacity are broken down, increasing vulnerabilityto hazards (Wisner and Adams, 2002; Marulanda et al., 2008b, 2010,2011; UNISDR, 2009a). Much work has gone into identifying what thesefactors of capacity are, to understand both what drives capacity aswell as what acts as a barrier to it (Adger et al., 2004; Sharma andPadwardhan, 2008). 
Drivers of capacity include: an integrated economy; urbanization;
information technology; attention to human rights; agricultural capacity;strong international institutions; access to insurance; class structure; lifeexpectancy, health, and well-being; degree of urbanization; access topublic health facilities; community organizations; existing planningregulations at national and local levels; institutional and decisionmakingframeworks; existing warning and protection from natural hazards; andgood governance (Cannon, 1994; Handmer et al., 1999; Klein, 2001;Barnett, 2005; Brooks et al., 2005; Bettencourt et al., 2006). 
2.5. Dimensions and Trends of
Vulnerability and Exposure
This section presents multiple dimensions of exposure and vulnerability
to hazards, disasters, climate change, and extreme events. Someframeworks consider exposure to be a component of vulnerability (Turner
et al., 2003a), and the largest body of knowledge on dimensions refersto vulnerability rather than exposure, but the distinction between them
is often not made explicit. Vulnerability is: multi-dimensional and
differential – that is, it varies across physical space and among and
within social groups; scale-dependent with regard to space and units of
analysis such as individual, household, region, or system; and dynamic
– characteristics and driving forces of vulnerability change over time(Vogel and O’Brien, 2004). As vulnerability and exposure are not fixed,understanding the trends in vulnerability and exposure is therefore animportant aspect of the discussion.
There is high confidence that for several hazards, changes in exposure
and in some cases vulnerability are the main drivers behind observedtrends in disaster losses, rather than a change in hazard character, and
will continue to be essential drivers of changes in risk patterns over thecoming decades (Bouwer et al., 2007; Pielke Jr. and Landsea, 1998;UNISDR, 2009a). In addition, there is high confidence that climate change
will affect disaster risk not only through changes in the frequency,intensity, and duration of some events (see Chapter 3), but also throughindirect effects on vulnerability and exposure. In most cases, it will doso not in isolation but as one of many sources of possible stress, forinstance through impacts on the number of people in poverty or sufferingfrom food and water insecurity, changing disease patterns and generalhealth levels, and where people live. In some cases, these changes maybe positive, but in many cases, they will be negative, especially for manygroups and areas that are already among the most vulnerable. 
Although trends in some of the determinants of risk and vulnerability are
apparent (for example, accelerated urbanization), the extent to whichthese are altering levels of risk and vulnerability at a range of geographicaland time scales is not always clear. While there is high confidence that
these connections exist, current knowledge often does not allow us toprovide specific quantifications with regional or global significance.
The multidimensional nature of vulnerability and exposure makes any
organizing framework arbitrary, overlapping, and contentious to adegree. The following text is organized under three very broad headings:environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Each of these has anumber of subcategories, which map out the major elements of interest. 
2.5.1. Environmental Dimensions 
Environmental dimensions include: 
•Potentially vulnerable natural systems ( such as low-lying islands,
coastal zones, mountain regions, drylands, and Small IslandDeveloping States (Dow, 1992; UNCED, 1992; Pelling and Uitto,2001; Nicholls, 2004; UNISDR, 2004; Chapter 3)
•Impacts on systems (e.g., flooding of coastal cities and agricultural
lands, or forced migration)
•The mechanisms causing impacts (e.g., disintegration of particular
ice sheets) (Füssel and Klein, 2006; Schneider et al., 2007)
•Responses or adaptations to environmental conditions (UNEP/
UNISDR, 2008). 
There are important links between development, environmental
management, disaster reduction, and climate adaptation (e.g., van Aalstand Burton, 2002), also including social and legal aspects such asproperty rights (Adger, 2000). For the purposes of vulnerability analysisin the context of climate change, it is important to acknowledge thatthe environment and human beings that form the socio-ecologicalsystem (Gallopin et al., 2001) behave in nonlinear ways, and arestrongly coupled, complex, and evolving (Folke et al., 2002).
There are many examples of the interactions between society and
environment that make people vulnerable to extreme events (Bohle etChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability77al., 1994) and highlight the vulnerability of ecosystem services (Metzger
et al., 2006). As an example, vulnerabilities arising from floodplainencroachment and increased hazard exposure are typical of the intricateand finely balanced relationships within human-environment systems(Kates, 1971; White, 1974) of which we have been aware for severaldecades. Increasing human occupancy of floodplains increases exposureto flood hazards. It can put not only the lives and property of humanbeings at risk but can damage floodplain ecology and associatedecosystem services. Increased exposure of human beings comes abouteven in the face of actions designed to reduce the hazard. Structuralresponses and alleviation measures (e.g., provision of embankments,channel modification, and other physical alterations of the floodplainenvironment), designed ostensibly to reduce flood risk, can have thereverse result. This is variously known as the levee effect (Kates, 1971;White, 1974), the escalator effect (Parker, 1995), or the ‘safe developmentparadox’ (Burby, 2006) in which floodplain encroachment leads toincreased flood risk and, ultimately, flood damages. A maladaptivepolicy response to such exposure provides structural flood defenses,which encourage the belief that the flood risk has been removed. Thisin turn encourages more floodplain encroachment and a reiteration ofthe cycle as the flood defenses (built to a lower design specification) areexceeded. This is typical of many maladaptive policy responses, whichfocus on the symptoms rather than the causes of poor environmentalmanagement. 
Floodplains, even in low-lying coastal zones, have the potential to
provide benefits and/or risks and it is the form of the social interaction
(see next subsection) that determines which, and to whom. Climatevariability shifts previous risk-based decisionmaking into conditions ofgreater uncertainty where we can be less certain of the probabilities ofoccurrence of any extreme event.
The environmental dimension of vulnerability also deals with the role of
regulating ecosystem services and ecosystem functions, which directlyimpact human well-being, particularly for those social groups thatheavily depend on these services and functions due to their livelihoodprofiles. Especially in developing countries and countries in transition,poorer rural communities often entirely depend on ecosystem services
and functions to meet their livelihood needs. The importance of these
ecosystem services and ecosystem functions for communities in the
context of environmental vulnerability and disaster risk has beenrecognized by the 2009 and 2011 Global Assessment Reports onDisaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2009a, 2011) as well as by theMillennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005). The degradation ofecosystem services and functions can contribute to an exacerbation of
both the natural hazard context and the vulnerability of people. Theerosion of ecosystem services and functions can contribute to the decreaseof coping and adaptive capacities in terms of reduced alternatives forlivelihoods and income-generating activities due to the degradation ofnatural resources. Additionally, a worsening of environmental services
and functions might also increase the costs of accessing these services,
for example, in terms of the increased time and travel needed to access
drinking water in rural communities affected by droughts or salinization.Furthermore, environmental vulnerability can also mean that in the case
of a hazardous event occurring, the community may lose access to theonly available water resource or face a major reduction in productivityof the soil, which then also increases the risk of crop failure. Forinstance, Renaud (2006) underscored that the salinization of wells afterthe 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had a highly negative consequence forthose communities that had no alternative access to freshwaterresources. 
2.5.1.1. Physical Dimensions 
Within the environmental dimension, physical aspects refer to a location-specific context for human-environment interaction (Smithers and Smit,1997) and to the material world (e.g., built structures).
The physical exposure of human beings to hazards has been partly
shaped by patterns of settlement of hazard-prone landscapes for thecountervailing benefits they offer (UNISDR, 2004). Furthermore, in thecontext of climate change, physical exposure is in many regions alsoincreasing due to spatial extension of natural hazards, such as floods,areas affected by droughts, or delta regions affected by salinization.This does not make the inhabitants of such locations vulnerable per sebecause they may have capacities to resist the impacts of extreme events;this is the essential difference between exposure and vulnerability. Thephysical dimension of vulnerability begins with the recognition of a link
between an extreme physical or natural phenomenon and a vulnerablehuman group (Westgate and O’Keefe, 1976). Physical vulnerabilitycomprises aspects of geography, location, and place (Wilbanks, 2003);settlement patterns; and physical structures (Shah, 1995; UNISDR,2004) including infrastructure located in hazard-prone areas or withdeficiencies in resistance or susceptibility to damage (Wilches-Chaux,1989). Further, Cutter’s (1996) ‘hazards of place’ model of vulnerabilityexpressly refers to the temporal dimension (see Section 2.5.4.2), which,in recognizing the dynamic nature of place vulnerability, argues for amore nuanced approach.
2.5.1.2. Geography, Location, Place
Aggregate trends in the environmental dimensions of exposure andvulnerability as they relate to geography, location, and place are givenin Chapters 3 and 4, while this section deals with the more conceptualaspects.
There is a significant difference in exposure and vulnerability between
developing and developed countries. While a similar (average) number ofpeople in low and high human development countries may be exposedto hazards each year (11 and 15% respectively), the average numberskilled is very different (53 and 1% respectively) (Peduzzi, 2006).
Developing countries are recognized as facing the greater impacts and
having the most vulnerable populations, in the greatest number, whoChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability78are least able to easily adapt to changes in inter alia temperature, water
resources, agricultural production, human health, and biodiversity(IPCC, 2001; McCarthy et al., 2001; Beg et al., 2002). Small IslandDeveloping States, a number of which are also Least DevelopedCountries, are recognized as being highly vulnerable to external shocksincluding climate extremes (UN/DESA, 2010; Chapter 3). While efforts inclimate change adaptation have been undertaken, progress has beenlimited, focusing on public awareness, research, and policy developmentrather than implementation (UN/DESA, 2010). 
Developed countries are also vulnerable and have geographically
distinct levels of vulnerability, which are masked by a predominant focuson direct impacts on biophysical systems and broad economic sectors.However, indirect and synergistic effects, differential vulnerabilities, andassumptions of relative ease of adaptation within apparently robustdeveloped countries may lead to unforeseen vulnerabilities (O’Brien et al.,2006). Thus, development per se is not a guarantee of ‘invulnerability.’Development can undermine ecosystem resilience on the one hand butcreate wealth that may enhance societal resilience overall if equitable(Barnett, 2001).
The importance of geography has been highlighted in an analysis of
‘disaster hotspots’ by Dilley et al. (2005). Hazard exposure (eventincidence) is combined with historical vulnerability (measured bymortality and economic loss) in order to identify geographic regionsthat are at risk from a range of geophysical hazards. While flood risk iswidespread across a number of regions, drought and especially cyclonerisk demonstrate distinct spatial patterns with the latter closely relatedto the climatological pattern of cyclone tracks and landfall. 
2.5.1.3. Settlement Patterns and Development Trajectories
There are specific exposure/vulnerability dimensions associated withurbanization (Hardoy and Pandiella, 2009) and rurality (Scoones, 1998;Nelson et al., 2010a,b). The major focus below is on the urban becauseof the increasing global trend toward urbanization and its potential forincreasing exposure and vulnerability of large numbers of people.
2.5.1.3.1. The urban environment
Accelerated urbanization is an important trend in human settlement,
which has implications for the consideration of exposure and vulnerabilityto extreme events. There has been almost a quintupling of the globalurban population between 1950 and 2011 with the majority of thatincrease being in less developed regions (UN-HABITAT, 2011).
There is high confidence that rapid and unplanned urbanization
processes in hazardous areas exacerbate vulnerability to disaster risk
(Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2005). The development of megacities with
high population densities (Mitchell, 1999a,b; Guha-Sapir et al., 2004)has led to greater numbers being exposed and increased vulnerabilitythrough, inter alia , poor infrastructural development (Uitto, 1998) and
the synergistic effects of intersecting natural, technological, and socialrisks (Mitchell, 1999a). Lavell (1996) identified eight contexts of citiesthat increase or contribute to disaster risk and vulnerability and arerelevant in the context of climate change:
1)The synergic nature of the city and the interdependency of its parts
2)The lack of redundancy in its transport, energy, and drainage systems
3)Territorial concentration of key functions and density of buildingand population
4)Mislocation
5)Social-spatial segregation
6)Environmental degradation
7)Lack of institutional coordination
8)The contrast between the city as a unified functioning system andits administrative boundaries that many times impede coordinationof actions.
The fact that urban areas are complex systems poses potential
management challenges in terms of the interplay between people,infrastructure, institutions, and environmental processes (Ruth andCoelho, 2007). Alterations or trends in any of these, or additionalcomponents of the urban system such as environmental governance(Freudenberg et al., 2008) or the uptake of insurance (McLemand andSmit 2006; Lamond et al., 2009), have the potential to increase exposure
and vulnerability to extreme climate events substantially. 
The increasing polarization and spatial segregation of groups with
different degrees of vulnerability to disaster have been identified as anemerging problem (Mitchell, 1999b). For the United States, where there isconsiderable regional variability, the components found to consistentlyincrease social vulnerability (as expressed by a Social Vulnerability Index)are density (urbanization), race/ethnicity (see below), and socioeconomicstatus, with the level of development of the built environment, age,race/ethnicity, and gender accounting for nearly half of the variability insocial vulnerability among US counties (Cutter and Finch, 2008). Socialisolation, especially as it intersects with individual characteristics (seeCase Study 9.2.1) and other social processes of marginalization(Duneier, 2004) also play a significant role in vulnerability creation (or,conversely, reduction).
Rapidly growing urban populations may affect the capacity of developing
countries to cope with the effects of extreme events because of theinability of governments to provide the requisite urban infrastructure orfor citizens to pay for essential services (UN-HABITAT, 2009). However,there is a more general concern that there has been insufficient atten tion
to both existing needs for infrastructure maintenance and appropriateongoing adaptation of infrastructure to meet potential climate extremes(Auld and MacIver, 2007). Further, while megacities have been associatedwith increasing hazard for some time (Mitchell, 1999a), small cities andrural communities are potentially more vulnerable to disasters than bigcities or megacities, since megacities have considerable resources fordealing with hazards and disasters (Cross, 2001) and smaller settlementsare often of lower priority for government spending.Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability79The built environment can be both protective of, and subject to, climate
extremes. Inadequate structures make victims of their occupants and,conversely, adequate structures can reduce human vulnerability. Thecontinuing toll of deaths and injuries in unsafe schools (UNISDR,2009a), hospitals and health facilities (PAHO/World Bank, 2004),domestic structures (Hewitt, 1997), and infrastructure more broadly(Freeman and Warner 2001) are indicative of the vulnerability of manyparts of the built environment. In a changing climate, more variableand with potentially more extreme events, old certainties about theprotective ability of built structures are undermined.
The increase in the number and extent of informal settlements or slums
(UN-HABITAT, 2003; Utzinger and Keiser, 2006) is important because theyare often located on marginal land within cities or on the peripherybecause of the lack of alternative locations or the fact that areas closeto river systems or areas at the coast are sometimes state land that canbe more easily accessed than private land. Because of their location,slums are often exposed to hydrometeorological-related hazards suchas landslides (Nathan, 2008) and floods (Bertoni, 2006; Colten, 2006;Aragon-Durand, 2007; Douglas et al., 2008; Zahran et al., 2008).Vulnerability in informal settlements can also be elevated because ofpoor health (Sclar et al., 2005), livelihood insecurity (Kantor and Nair,2005), lack of access to service provision and basic needs (such asclean water and good governance), and a reduction in the capacity offormal players to steer developments and adaptation initiatives in acomprehensive, preventive, and inclusive way (Birkmann et al., 2010b).Lagos, Nigeria (
Adelekan, 2010), and Chittagong, Bangladesh ( Rahman
et al., 2010), serve as clear examples of where an upward trend in thearea of slums has resulted in an increase in the exposure of slumdwellers to flooding. Despite the fact that rapidly growing informaland poor urban areas are often hotspots of hazard exposure, for anumber of locations the urban poor have developed more or lesssuccessful coping and adaptation strategies to reduce their vulnerabilityin dealing with changing environmental conditions (e.g., Birkmann et al.,2010b). 
Globally, the pressure for urban areas to expand onto flood plains and
coastal strips has resulted in an increase in exposure of populations to
riverine and coastal flood risk (McGranahan et al., 2007; Nicholls et al.,
2011). For example, intensive and unplanned human settlements in
flood-prone areas appear to have played a major role in increasing
flood risk in Africa over the last few decades (Di Baldassarre et al.,2010). As urban areas have expanded, urban heat has become amanagement and health issue (for more on this see Section 2.5.2.3 and
Chapters 3, 5, and 9). For some cities there is clear evidence of a recent
trend in loss of green space (Boentje and Blinnikov, 2007; Sanli et al.,2008; Rafiee et al., 2009) due to a variety of reasons including plannedand unplanned urbanization with the latter driven by internal and externalmigration resulting in the expansion of informal settlements. Such
changes in green space may increase exposure to extreme climate
events in urban areas through decreasing runoff amelioration, urbanheat island mitigation effects, and alterations in biodiversity (Wilby
and Perry, 2006).While megacities have been associated with increasing hazard for some
time (Mitchell, 1999a), small cities and rural communities (see nextsection) are potentially more vulnerable to disasters than big cities ormegacities, since megacities have considerable resources for dealingwith hazards and disasters (Cross, 2001) and smaller settlements areoften of lower priority for government spending. 
Urbanization itself is not always a driver for increased vulnerability.
Instead, the type of urbanization and the context in which urbanizationis embedded defines whether these processes contribute to an increaseor decrease in people’s vulnerability. 
2.5.1.3.2. The rural environment
Many rural livelihoods are reliant to a considerable degree on theenvironment and natural resource base (Scoones, 1998), and extremeclimate events can impact severely on the agricultural sector (Saldaña-Zorrilla, 2007). However, despite the separation here, the urban andthe rural are inextricably linked. Inhabitants of rural areas are oftendependent on cities for employment, as a migratory destination of lastresort, and for health care and emergency services. Cities depend onrural areas for food, water, labor, ecosystem services, and otherresources. All of these (and more) can be impacted by climate-relatedvariability and extremes including changes in these associated withclimate change. In either case, it is necessary to identify the manyexogenous factors that affect a household’s livelihood security. 
Eakin’s (2005) examination of rural Mexico presents empirical findings
of the interactions (e.g., between neoliberalism and the opening up ofagricultural markets, and the agricultural impacts of climatic extremes),which amplify or mitigate risky outcomes. The findings point to economicuncertainty over environmental risk, which most influences agriculturalhouseholds’ decisionmaking. However, there is not a direct and inevitablelink between disaster impact and increased impoverishment of a ruralpopulation. In Nicaragua, Jakobsen (2009) found that a household’sprobability of being poor in the years following Hurricane Mitch was notaffected by whether it was living in an area struck but by factors such asoff-farm income, household size, and access to credit. Successful copingpost-Hurricane Mitch resulted in poor households regaining most oftheir assets and resisting a decline into a state of extreme poverty.However, longer-term adaptation strategies, which might have lifted themout of the poverty category, eluded the majority and were independentof having experienced Hurricane Mitch. Thus, while poor (rural) householdsmay cope with the impacts of a disaster in the relatively short term,their level of vulnerability, arising from a complex of environmental,social, economic, and political factors, is such that they cannot escapethe poverty trap or fully reinstate development gains.
In assessing the material on exposure and vulnerability to climate
extremes in urban and rural environments it is clear that there is nosimple, deterministic relationship; it is not possible to show that eitherrural or urban environments are more vulnerable (or resilient). InChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability80either context there is the potential that climate risks can be either
ameliorated or exacerbated by positive or negative adaptation processesand outcomes. 
2.5.2. Social Dimensions
The social dimension is multi-faceted and cross-cutting. It focusesprimarily on aspects of societal organization and collective aspectsrather than individuals. However, some assessments also use the‘individual’ descriptor to clarify issues of scale and units of analysis
(Adger and Kelly, 1999; K. O’Brien et al., 2008). Notions of the individual
are also useful when considering psychological trauma in and afterdisasters (e.g., Few, 2007), including that related to family breakdownand loss. The social dimension includes demography, migration, anddisplacement, social groups, education, health and well-being, culture,institutions, and governance aspects.
2.5.2.1. Demography
Certain population groups may be more vulnerable than others to climatevariability and extremes. For example, the very young and old are morevulnerable to heat extremes than other population groups (Staffogia etal., 2006; Gosling et al., 2009). A rapidly aging population at thecommunity to country scale bears implications for health, social isolation,economic growth, family composition, and mobility, all of which aresocial determinants of vulnerability. However, as discussed furtherbelow (Social Groups section), static checklists of vulnerable groups donot reflect the diversity or dynamics of people’s changing conditions.
2.5.2.1.1. Migration and displacement
Trends in migration, as a component of changing population dynamics,have the potential to rise because of alterations in extreme climateevent frequency. The United Nations Office for the Coordination ofHumanitarian Affairs and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre
have estimated that around 20 million people were displaced or
evacuated in 2008 because of rapid onset climate-related disasters(OCHA/IDMC, 2009). Further, over the last 30 years, twice as manypeople have been affected by droughts (slow onset events not includedin the previous point) as by storms (1.6 billion compared withapproximately 718 million) (IOM, 2009). However, because of the multi-
causal nature of migration, the relationship between climatic variability
and change in migration is contested (Black, 2001) as are the termsenvironmental and climate refugees (Myers, 1993; Castles 2002; IOM,2009). Despite an increase in the number of hydrometeorological
disasters between 1990 and 2009, the International Organization onMigration reports no major impact on international migratory flows
because displacement is temporary and often confined within a region,
and displaced individuals do not possess the financial resources to
migrate (IOM, 2009).Although there is also a lack of clear evidence for a systematic trend in
extreme climate events and migration, there are clear instances of theimpact of extreme hydrometeorological events on displacement. Forexample, floods in Mozambique displaced 200,000 people in 2001,163,000 people in 2007, and 102,000 more in 2008 (INGC, 2009; IOM,2009); in Niger, large internal movements of people are due topervasive changes related to drought and desertification trends (Afifi,2011); in the Mekong River Delta region, changing flood patterns appearto be associated with migratory movements (White, 2002; IOM, 2009);and Hurricane Katrina, for which social vulnerability, race, and classplayed an important role in outward and returning migration (Elliottand Pais, 2006; Landry et al., 2007; Myers et al., 2008), resulted in thedisplacement of over one million people. As well as the displacementeffect, there is evidence for increased vulnerability to extreme eventsamong migrant groups because of an inability to understand extremeevent-related information due to language problems, prioritization offinding employment and housing, and distrust of authorities (Enarsonand Morrow, 2000; Donner and Rodriguez, 2008).
Migration can be both a condition of, and a response to, vulnerability –
especially political vulnerability created through conflict, which can drivepeople from their homelands. Increasingly it relates to economically andenvironmentally displaced persons but can also refer to those who donot cross international borders but become internally displaced personsas a result of extreme events in both developed and developing countries(e.g., Myers et al., 2008).
Although data on climate change-forced displacement is incomplete, it
is clear that the many outcomes of climate change processes will beseen and felt as disasters by the affected populations (Oliver-Smith,2009). For people affected by disasters, subsequent displacement andresettlement often constitute a second disaster in their lives. As partof the Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction approach, Cernea(1996) outlines the eight basic risks to which people are subjected bydisplacement: landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, marginalization,food insecurity, increased morbidity, loss of access to common propertyresources, and social disarticulation. When people are forced from theirknown environments, they become separated from the material andcultural resource base upon which they have depended for life asindividuals and as communities (Altman and Low, 1992). The materiallosses most often associated with displacement and resettlement arelosses of access to customary housing and resources. Displaced peopleare often distanced from their sources of livelihood, whether land,common property (water, forests, etc.), or urban markets and clientele(Koenig, 2009). Disasters and displacement may sever the identificationwith an environment that may once have been one of the principlefeatures of cultural identity (Oliver-Smith, 2006). Displacement for anygroup can be distressing, but for indigenous peoples it can result inparticularly severe impacts. The environment and ties to land areconsidered to be essential elements in the survival of indigenous societiesand distinctive cultural identities (Colchester, 2000). The displacementand resettlement process has been consistently shown to disrupt anddestroy those networks of social relationships on which the poorChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability81depend for resource access, particularly in times of stress (Cernea, 1996;
Scudder, 2005). 
Migration is an ancient coping mechanism in response to environmental
(and other) change and does not inevitably result in negative outcomes,either for the migrants themselves or for receiving communities (Barnettand Webber, 2009). Climate variability will result in some movement ofstressed people but there is low confidence in ability to assign direct
causality to climatic impacts or to the numbers of people affected.
2.5.2.1.2. Social groups
Research evidence of the differential vulnerability of social groups isextensive and raises concerns about the disproportionate effects ofclimate change on identifiable, marginalized populations (Bohle et al.,1994; Kasperson and Kasperson, 2001; Thomalla et al., 2006). Particulargroups and conditions have been identified as having differentialexposure or vulnerability to extreme events, for example race/ethnicity(Fothergill et al., 1999; Elliott and Pais, 2006; Cutter and Finch, 2008),socioeconomic class and caste (O’Keefe et al., 1976; Peacock et al.,1997; Ray-Bennett, 2009), gender (Sen, 1981), age (both the elderly andchildren; Jabry, 2003; Wisner, 2006b; Bartlett, 2008), migration, andhousing tenure (whether renter or owner), as among the most commonsocial vulnerability characteristics (Cutter and Finch, 2008). Morrow(1999) extends and refines this list to include residents of group livingfacilities; ethnic minorities (by language); recent migrants (includingimmigrants); tourists and transients; physically or mentally disabled (seealso McGuire et al., 2007; Peek and Stough, 2010); large households;renters; large concentrations of children and youth; poor households;the homeless (see also Wisner, 1998); and women-headed households.Generally, the state of vulnerability is defined by a specific populationat a particular scale; aggregations (and generalizations) are often lessmeaningful and require careful interpretation (Adger and Kelly, 1999). 
One of the largest bodies of research evidence, and one which can be an
exemplar for the way many other marginalized groups are differentiallyimpacted or affected by extreme events, has been on gender and disaster,
and on women in particular (e.g., Neal and Phillips, 1990; Enarson and
Morrow, 1998; Neumayer and Plümper, 2007). This body of literature is
relatively recent, particularly in a developed world context, given the
longer recognition of gender concerns in the development field
(Fordham, 1998). The specific gender and climate change link including
self-defined gender groups has been even more recent (e.g., Masika,
2002; Pincha and Krishna, 2009). The research evidence emphasizes the
social construction of gendered vulnerability in which women and girls
are often (although not always) at greater risk of dying in disasters,
typically marginalized from decisionmaking fora, and discriminated andacted against in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts
(Houghton, 2009; Sultana, 2010). 
Women or other socially marginalized or excluded groups are not
vulnerable through biology (except in very particular circumstances) butare made so by societal structures and roles. For example, in the Indian
Ocean tsunami of 2004, many males were out to sea in boats, fulfillingtheir roles as fishermen, and were thus less exposed than were manywomen who were on the seashore, fulfilling their roles as preparers and
marketers of the fish catch. However, the women were made vulnerable
not simply by their location and role but by societal norms which did notencourage survival training for girls (e.g., to swim or climb trees) andwhich placed the majority of the burden of child and elder care withwomen. Thus, escape was made more difficult for women carryingchildren and responsible for others (Doocy et al., 2007).
The gender and disaster/climate change literature has also recognized
resilience/capacity/capability alongside vulnerability. This elaboration of thevulnerability approach makes clear that vulnerability in these identifiedgroups is not an immutable or totalizing condition. The vulnerability‘label’ can reinforce notions of passivity and helplessness, which obscurethe very significant, active contributions that socially marginalizedgroups make in coping with and adapting to extremes. An example isprovided in Box 2-2.
2.5.2.2. Education
The education dimension ranges across the vulnerability of educationalbuilding structures; issues related to access to education; and alsosharing and access to disaster risk reduction and climate adaptationinformation and knowledge (Wisner, 2006b). Priority 3 of the HyogoFramework for Action 2005-2015 recommends the use of knowledge,innovation, and education to build a ‘culture of safety and resilience’ atall levels (UNISDR, 2007a). A well-informed and motivated populationcan lead to disaster risk reduction but it requires the collection anddissemination of knowledge and information on hazards, vulnerabilities,and capacities. However, “It is not information per se that determinesaction, but how people interpret it in the context of their experience,beliefs and expectations. Perceptions of risks and hazards are culturallyand socially constructed, and social groups construct different meaningsfor potentially hazardous situations” (McIvor and Paton, 2007). In additionto knowledge and information, explicit environmental education programsamong children and adults may have benefits for public understandingof risk, vulnerability, and exposure to extreme events (UNISDR, 2004;Kobori, 2009; Nomura, 2009; Patterson et al., 2009; Kuhar et al., 2010),because they promote resilience building in socio-ecological systemsthrough their role in stewardship of biological diversity and ecosystemservices, provide the opportunity to integrate diverse forms of knowledgeand participatory processes in resource management (Krasny and Tidball,2009), and help promote action towards sustainable development(Waktola, 2009; Breiting and Wikenberg, 2010). 
Many lives have been lost through the inability of education infrastructure
to withstand extreme events. Where flooding is a recurrent phenomenonschools can be exposed or vulnerable to floods. For example, a surveyof primary schools’ flood vulnerability in the Nyando River catchmentof western Kenya revealed that 40% were vulnerable, 48% wereChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability82marginally vulnerable, and 12% were not vulnerable; the vulnerability
status was attributed to a lack of funds, poor building standards, localtopography, soil types and inadequate drainage (Ochola et al., 2010).Improving education infrastructure safety can have multiple benefits.For example, the Malagasy Government initiated the Development
Intervention Fund IV project to reduce cyclone risk, including safer school
construction and retrofitting. In doing so, awareness and understanding
of disaster issues were increased within the community (Madagascar
Development Intervention Fund, 2007).
The impact of extreme events can limit the ability of parents to afford
to educate their children or require them (especially girl children, whose
access to education is typically prioritized less than that of boy children)
to work to meet basic needs (UNDP , 2004; UNICEF , 2009). 
Access to information related to early warnings, response strategies,
coping and adaptation mechanisms, science and technology, and human,
social, and financial capital is critical for reduction of vulnerability and
increasing resilience. A range of factors may control or influence the
access to information, including economic status, race (Spence et al.,
2007), trust (Longstaff and Yang, 2008), and belonging to a social
network (Peguero, 2006). However, the mode of information transfer orexchange must be considered because there is emerging evidence of a
growing digital inequality (Rideout, 2003) that may influence trends invulnerability as an increasing amount of information about extreme eventpreparedness and response is often made available via the internet (seeChapter 9). Evidence has existed for some time that people who haveexperienced natural hazards (and thus may have information andknowledge gained directly through that experience) are, in general,better prepared than those who have not (Kates, 1971). However, thisdoes not necessarily translate into protective behavior because of whathas been called the ‘prison of experience’ (Kates, 1962), in which people’sresponse behavior is determined by the previous experience and is notbased on an objective assessment of current risk. In the uncertaincontext of climate-related extremes, this may mean people are notappropriately educated regarding the risk. 
2.5.2.3. Health and Well-Being
The health dimension of vulnerability includes differential physical,
physiological, and mental health effects of extreme events in different
regions and on different social groups (McMichael et al., 2003; van
Lieshout et al., 2004; Haines et al., 2006; Few, 2007; Costello et al.,Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability
Box 2-2 | Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Adaptation, and Resilience-Building:
the Garifuna Women of Honduras
The Garifuna women of Honduras could be said to show multiple vulnerability characteristics (Brondo, 2007). They are women, the  gender
often made vulnerable by patriarchal structures worldwide; they come from Honduras, a developing country exposed to many hazard s;
they belong to an ethnic group descended from African slaves, which is socially, economically, and politically marginalized; an d they
depend largely upon a subsistence economy, with a lack of education, health, and other resources. However, despite these marker s of
vulnerability, the Garifuna women have organized to reduce their communities’ exposure to hazards and vulnerability to disaster s
through the protection and development of their livelihood opportunities (Fordham et al., 2011).
The women lead the Comité de Emergencia Garifuna de Honduras, which is a grassroots, community-based group of the Afro-Indigeno us
Garifuna that was developed in the wake of Hurricane Mitch in 1998. After Mitch, there was a lack of external support and so th e Comité
women organized themselves and repaired hundreds of houses, businesses, and public buildings, in the process of which women wer e
empowered and trained in non-traditional work. They campaigned to buy land for relocating housing to safer areas, in which the poorest
families participated in the reconstruction process. Since being trained themselves in vulnerability and capacity mapping by gr assroots
women in Jamaica, they have in turn trained 60 trainers in five Garifuna communities to carry out mapping exercises in their co mmunities. 
The Garifuna women have focused on livelihood-based activities to ensure food security by reviving and improving the production  of
traditional root crops, building up traditional methods of soil conservation, carrying out training in organic composting and p esticide use,
and creating the first Garifuna farmers’ market. In collaborative efforts, 16 towns now have established tool banks, and five h ave seed
banks. Through reforestation, the cultivation of medicinal and artisanal plants, and the planting of wild fruit trees along the  coast, they
are helping to prevent erosion and reducing community vulnerability to hazards and the vagaries of climate.
The Garifuna women’s approach, which combines livelihood-based recovery, disaster risk reduction, and climate change adaptation , has
had wide-ranging benefits. They have built up their asset base (human, social, physical, natural, financial, and political), an d improved
their communities’ nutrition, incomes, natural resources, and risk management. They continue to partner with local, regional, a nd
international networks for advocacy and knowledge exchange. The women and communities are still at risk (Drusine, 2005) but the se
strategies help reduce their socioeconomic vulnerability and dependence on external aid (Fordham et al., 2011).832009). It also includes, in a link to the institutional dimension, health
service provision (e.g., environmental health and public health issues,infrastructure and conditions; Street et al., 2005), which may be impactedby extreme events (e.g., failures in hospital/health center buildingstructures; inability to access health services because of storms andfloods). Vulnerability can also be understood in terms of functionalityrelated to communication, medical care, maintaining independence,supervision, and transportation. In addition individuals including children,senior citizens, and pregnant women and those who may need additionalresponse assistance including the disabled, those living in institutionalizedsettings, those from diverse cultures, people with limited Englishproficiency or are non-English speaking, those with no access to transport,have chronic medical disorders, and have pharmacological dependencycan also be considered vulnerable in a health context.
Unfortunately, the health dimensions of disasters are difficult to measure
because of difficulties in attributing the health condition (includingmortality) directly to the extreme event because of secondary effects; inaddition, some of the effects are delayed in time, which again makesattribution difficult (Bennet, 1970; Hales et al., 2003). The difficulty ofcollection of epidemiological data in crisis situations is also a factor,especially in low-income countries. Further understanding the post-traumatic stress disorder dimensions of extreme climate events and thepsychological aspects of climate change presents a number of challenges(Amstadter et al., 2009; Kar, 2009; Mohay and Forbes, 2009; Furr et al.,2010; Doherty and Clayton, 2011).
Health vulnerability is the sum of all the risk and protective factors
that determine the degree to which individuals or communities couldexperience adverse impacts from extreme weather events (Balbus andMalina, 2009). Vulnerabilities can arise from a wide range of institutional,geographic, environmental, socioeconomic, biological sensitivity, and otherfactors, which can vary spatially and temporally. Biological sensitivitycan be associated with developmental stage (e.g., children are atincreased mortality risk from diarrheal diseases); pre-existing medicalconditions (e.g., diabetics are at increased risk during heat waves);acquired conditions (e.g., malaria immunity); and genetic factors(Balbus and Malina, 2009). Vulnerability can be viewed both from theperspective of the population groups more likely to experience adversehealth outcomes and from the perspective of the public health and
health care interventions required to prevent adverse health impacts
during and following an extreme event. 
For some extreme weather events the vulnerable population groups
depend on the adverse health outcome considered. For example, in the
case of heat waves socially isolated elderly people with pre-existing
medical conditions are vulnerable to heat-related health effects (see
Chapter 9). For floods, children are at greater risk for transmission offecal-oral diseases, and those with mobility and cognitive constraintscan be at increased risk of injuries and deaths (Ahern et al., 2005), whilepeople on low incomes are less likely to be able to afford insurance
against risks associated with flooding, such as storm and flood damage
(Marmot, 2010). Flooding has been found to increase the risk of mentalhealth problems, pre- and post-event, in both adults and children
(Ginexi et al., 2000; Reacher et al., 2004; Ahern et al., 2005; Carroll etal., 2006; Tunstall et al., 2006; UK Department of Health, 2009). A UKstudy of over 1,200 households affected by flooding suggested thatthere were greater impacts on physical and mental health among morevulnerable groups and poorer households and communities (Werritty etal., 2007). However, while there is evidence for impacts on particularsocial groups in identified disaster types, there are some social groupsthat are more likely to be vulnerable whatever the hazard type; theseinclude those at the extremes of the age range, those with underlyingmedical conditions, and those otherwise stressed by low socioeconomic
status. The role of socioeconomic factors supports the necessity of a
social, and not just a medical, model of response and adaptation.
A number of public health impacts are expected to worsen in climate-
related disasters such as storms, floods, landslides, heat, drought, andwildfire. These are highly context-specific but range from worsening ofexisting chronic illnesses (which could be widespread), through possibletoxic exposures (in air, water or food), to deaths (expected to be few tomoderate but may be many in low-income countries) (Keim, 2008).Public health and health care services required for preventing adversehealth impacts from an extreme weather event include surveillance andcontrol activities for infectious diseases, access to safe water and improvedsanitation, food security, maintenance of solid waste management andother critical infrastructure, maintenance of hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, provision of mental health services, sufficient andsafe shelter to prevent or mitigate displacement, and effective warningand informing systems (Keim, 2008). Further, it is important to considerthe synergistic effects of NaTech disasters (Natural Hazard Triggering aTechnological Disaster) where impacts can be considerable if only single,simple hazard events are planned for. In an increasingly urbanized world,interactions between natural disasters and simultaneous technologicalaccidents must be given attention (Cruz et al., 2004); the combinationof an earthquake, tsunami, and radiation release at the JapaneseFukushima Nuclear Power plant in March 2011 is the most recentexample. Lack of provision of these services increases populationvulnerability, particularly in individuals with greater biological sensitivityto an adverse health outcome. Although there is little evidence fortrends in the exposure or vulnerability of public health infrastructure,the imperative for a resilient health infrastructure is widely recognizedin the context of extreme climate events (Burkle and Greenough, 2008;Keim, 2008).
Deteriorating environmental conditions as a result of extremes (including
land clearing, salinization, dust generation, altered ecology; Renaud,2006; Middleton et al., 2008; Ellis and Wilcox, 2009; Hong et al., 2009;Ljung et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2010) can impact keyecosystem services and exacerbate climate sensitive disease incidence(e.g., diarrheal disease; Clasen et al., 2007), particularly via deterioratingwater quality and quantity.
For some health outcomes, which have direct or indirect implications for
vulnerability to extreme climate events, there is evidence of trends. For
Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability84example, obesity, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which in turn
is a heat risk factor (Bouchama et al., 2007) has been noted to be on theincrease in a number of developed countries (Skelton et al., 2009;Stamatakis et al., 2010). Observed trends in major public health threatssuch as the infectious or communicable diseases HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,and malaria, although not directly linked to the diminution of long-termresilience of some populations, have been identified as having thepotential to do so (IFRC, 2008). In addition to the diseases themselves,persistent and increasing obstacles to expanding or strengtheninghealth systems such as inadequate human resources and poor hospitaland laboratory infrastructure as observed in some countries (Vitoria etal., 2009) may also contribute indirectly to increasing vulnerability andexposure where, for example, malaria and HIV/Aids occasionally reachepidemic proportions. 
However, trends in well-being and health are difficult to assess.
Indicators that characterize a lack of well-being and a high degree ofsusceptibility are, for example, indicators of undernourishment andmalnutrition. The database for the Millennium Development Goals andrespective statistics of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)underscore that trends in undernourishment are spatially and temporallydifferentiated. While, as but one example, the trend in undernourishedpeople in Burundi shows a significant increase from 1991 to 2005, anopposite trend of a reduction in the percentage of undernourishedpeople can be observed in Angola (see UN Statistics Division, 2011;FAOSTAT, 2011). Thus, evidence exists that trends in vulnerability, e.g.,in terms of well-being and undernourishment change over time and arehighly differentiated in terms of spatial patterns.
In considering health-related exposure and vulnerability to extreme events,
evidence from past climate/weather-related disaster events (across arange of hazard types for which lack of space precludes coverage)makes clear the links to a range of negative outcomes for physical andmental health and health infrastructure. Furthermore, there is clearevidence (Haines et al., 2006; Confalonieri et al., 2007) that current andprojected health impacts from climate change are multifarious and willaffect low-income groups and low-income countries the most severely,although high-income countries are not immune.
2.5.2.4. Cultural Dimensions
The broad term ‘culture’ embraces a complexity of elements that can
relate to a way of life, behavior, taste, ethnicity, ethics, values, beliefs,
customs, ideas, institutions, art, and intellectual achievements that
affect, are produced, or are shared by a particular society. In essence, all
these characteristics can be summarized to describe culture as ‘theexpression of humankind within society’ (Aysan and Oliver, 1987).
Culture is variously used to describe many aspects of extreme risks from
natural disasters or climate change, including: 
•Cultural aspects of risk perception
•Negative culture of danger/ vulnerability/ fear•Culture of humanitarian concern
•Culture of organizations / institutions and their responses
•Culture of preventive actions to reduce risks, including the creationof buildings to resist extreme climatic forces
•Ways to create and maintain a ‘Risk Management Culture,’ a‘Safety Culture,’ or an ‘Adaptation Culture.’
In relation to our understanding of risk, certain cultural issues need to
be noted. Typical examples are cited below:
• Ethnicity and Culture. Deeply rooted cultural values are a dominant
factor in whether or not communities adapt to climate change. Forexample, recent research in Northern Burkina Faso indicates thattwo ethnic groups have adopted very different strategies due tocultural values and historical relations, despite their presence inthe same physical environment and their shared experience ofclimate change (Nielsen and Reenberg, 2010).
• Locally Based Risk Management Culture. Wisner (2003) has argued
that the point in developing a ‘culture of prevention’ is to buildnetworks at the neighborhood level capable of ongoing hazardassessment and mitigation at the micro level. He has noted that whilecommunity based NGOs emerged to support recovery after theMexico City and Northridge earthquakes, these were not sustainedover time to promote risk reduction activities. This evidenceconfirms other widespread experience indicating that ways stillneed to be found to extend the agenda of Community-BasedOrganizations into effective action to reduce climate risks andpromote adaptation to climate change.
• Conflicting Cultures: Who Benefits, and Who Loses when Risks are
Reduced? A critical cultural conflict can arise when private actions
to reduce disaster risks and adapting to climate change by oneparty have negative consequences on another. This regularly appliesin river flood hazard management where upstream measures toreduce risks can significantly increase downstream threats topersons and property. Adger has argued that if appropriate riskreduction actions are to occur, the key players must bear all thecosts and receive all the benefits from their actions (Adger, 2009).However, this can be problematic if adaptation is limited to specificlocal interests only.
Traditional behaviors tied to local (and wider) tradition and cultural
practices can increase vulnerability – for example, unequal gender normsthat put women and girls at greater risk, or traditional uses of theenvironment that have not adapted (or cannot adapt) to changedenvironmental circumstances. On the other hand, local or indigenousknowledge can reduce vulnerabilities too (Gaillard et al., 2007, 2010).Furthermore, cultural practices are often subtle and may be opaque tooutsiders. The early hazards paradigm literature (White, 1974; Burton etal., 1978) referred often to culturally embedded fatalistic attitudes,which resulted in inaction in the face of disaster risk. However,Schmuck-Widmann (2000), in her social anthropological studies of chardwellers in Bangladesh, revealed how a belief that disaster occurrenceand outcomes were in the hands of God did not preclude preparatoryactivities. Perceptions of risk (and their interpretation by others) dependChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability85on the cultural and social context (Slovic, 2000; Oppenheimer and
Todorov, 2006; Schneider et al., 2007). 
Research findings emphasize the importance of considering the role –
and cultures – of religion and faith in the context of disaster. Thisincludes the role of faith in the recovery process following a disaster(e.g., Davis and Wall, 1992; Massey and Sutton, 2007); religiousexplanations of nature (e.g., Orr, 2003; Peterson, 2005); the role ofreligion in influencing positions on environment and climate changepolicy (e.g., Kintisch, 2006; Hulme, 2009); and religion and vulnerability(Guth et al., 1995; Chester, 2005; Elliott et al., 2006; Schipper, 2010). 
The cultural dimension also includes the potential vulnerability of
aboriginal and native peoples in the context of climate extremes.Globally, indigenous populations are frequently dependent on primaryproduction and the natural resource base while being subject to(relatively) poor socioeconomic conditions (including poor health, highunemployment, low levels of education, and greater poverty). Thisapplies to groups from Canada (Turner and Clifton, 2009), to Australia(Campbell et al., 2008), to the Pacific (Mimura et al., 2007). Small islandstates, often with distinct cultures, typically show high vulnerability andlow adaptive capacity to climate change (Nurse and Sem, 2001).However, historically, indigenous groups have had to contend with manyhazards and, as a consequence, have developed capacities to cope(Campbell, 2006) such as the use of traditional knowledge systems,locally appropriate building construction with indigenous materials, anda range of other customary practices (Campbell, 2006).
Given the degree of cultural diversity identified, the importance of
understanding differential risk perceptions in a cultural context isreinforced (Marris et al., 1998). Cultural Theory has contributed to anunderstanding of how people interpret their world and define riskaccording to their worldviews: hierarchical, fatalistic, individualistic,and egalitarian (Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982). Too often policies andstudies focus on ‘the public’ in the aggregate and too little on the needs,interests, and attitudes of different social and cultural groups (see alsoSections 2.5.2.1.2 and 2.5.4). 
2.5.2.5. Institutional and Governance Dimensions
The institutional dimension is a key determinant of vulnerability to
extreme events (Adger, 1999). Institutions have been defined in a broad
sense to include “habitualized behavior and rules and norms that governsociety” (Adger, 2000) and not just the more typically understood
formal institutions. This view allows for a discussion of institutional
structures such as property rights and land tenure issues (Toni and
Holanda, 2008) that govern natural resource use and management. Itforms a bridge between the social and the environmental/ecological
dimensions and can induce sustainable or unsustainable exploitation
(Adger, 2000). Expanding the institutional domain to include politicaleconomy (Adger, 1999) and different modes of production – feudal,capitalist, socialist (Wisner, 1978) – raises questions about thevulnerability ofinstitutions and the vulnerability caused byinstitutions
(including government). Institutional factors play a critical role inadaptation (Adger, 2000) as they influence the social distribution ofvulnerability and shape adaptation capacity (Næss et al., 2005).
This broader understanding of the institutional dimension also takes us
into a recognition of the role of social networks, community bonds andorganizing structures, and processes that can buffer the impacts ofextreme events (Nakagawa and Shaw, 2004) partly through increasingsocial cohesion but also recognizing ambiguous or negative forms(UNISDR, 2004). For example, social capital/assets (Portes, 1998;Putnam, 2000) – “the norms and networks that enable people to actcollectively” (Woolcock and Narayan, 2000) – have a role in vulnerabilityreduction (Pelling, 1998). Social capital (or its lack) is both a cause andeffect of vulnerability and thus can result in either positive benefit ornegative impact; to be a part of a social group and accrue social assetsis often to indicate others’ exclusion. It also includes attempts toreframe climate debates by acknowledging the possibility of diverseimpacts on human security, which opens up human rights discoursesand rights-based approaches to disaster risk reduction (Kuwali, 2008;Mearns and Norton, 2010).
The institutional dimension includes the relationship between policy
setting and policy implementation in risk and disaster management. Top-down approaches assume policies are directly translated into action onthe ground; bottom-up approaches recognize the importance of otheractors in shaping policy implementation (Urwin and Jordan, 2008). Twigg’scategorization of the characteristics of the ideal disaster resilientcommunity (Twigg, 2007) adopts the latter approach. This guidelinedocument, which has been field tested by NGOs, identifies the importantrelations between the community and the enabling environment ofgovernance at various scales in creating resilience, and by inference,reducing vulnerability. This set of 167 characteristics (organized under fivethematic areas) also refers to institutional forms for (and processes of)engagement with risk assessment, risk management, and hazard andvulnerability mapping. These have been championed by institutionsworking across scales to create the Hyogo Framework for Action (UNISDR,2007a) and associated tools (Davis et al., 2004; UNISDR, 2007b) withthe goal to reduce disaster risk and vulnerability. However, linkagesacross scales and the inclusion of local knowledge systems are still notintegrated well in formal institutions (Næss et al., 2005).
A lack of institutional interaction and integration between disaster risk
reduction, climate change, and development may mean policy responsesare redundant or conflicting (Schipper and Pelling, 2006; Mitchell andvan Aalst, 2008; Mitchell et al., 2010). Thus, the institutional modeloperational in a given place and time (more or less participatory,deliberative, and democratic; integrated; or disjointed) could be animportant factor in either vulnerability creation or reduction (Comfort etal., 1999). Furthermore, risk-specific policies must also be integrated(see the slippage between UK heat and cold wave policies, Wolf et al.,2010a). However, further study of the role of institutions in influencingvulnerability is called for (O’Brien et al., 2004b).Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability86Governance is also a key topic for vulnerability and exposure.
Governance is broader than governmental actions; governance can beunderstood as the structures of common governance arrangements andprocesses of steering and coordination – including markets, hierarchies,networks, and communities (Pierre and Peters, 2000). Institutionalizedrule systems and habitualized behavior and norms that govern societyand guide actors are representing governance structures (Adger, 2000;Biermann et al., 2009). These formal and informal governance structuresalso determine vulnerability, since they influence power relations, riskperceptions, and constitute the context in which vulnerability, riskreduction, and adaptation are managed. 
Conflicts between formal and informal governance or governmental
and nongovernmental strategies and norms can generate additionalvulnerabilities for communities exposed to environmental change. Anexample of these conflicts of formal and informal strategies is linked toflood protection measures. While local people might expend resourcesto deal with increasing flood events (e.g., adapting their livelihoods andproduction patterns to changing flood regimes), formal adaptationstrategies, particularly in developing countries, prioritize structuralmeasures (e.g., dike systems or relocation strategies) that have severeconsequences for the vulnerability of communities dependent on localecosystem services, such as fishing and farming systems (see Birkmann,2011a,b). These conflicts between formal and informal or governmentaland nongovernmental management systems and norms are an importantfactor that increase vulnerability and reduce adaptive capacity of theoverall system (Birkmann et al., 2010b). Countries with institutional andgovernance fragilities often lack the capacity to identify and reducerisks and to deal with emergencies and disasters effectively. The recentdisaster and problems in coping and recovery in the aftermath of theearthquake in Haiti or the problems in terms of managing recovery andemergency management after the Pakistan floods are examples thatillustrate the importance of governance as a subject of resilience andvulnerability.
In some developed countries, the last 30 years have witnessed a shift in
environmental governance practices toward more integrated approaches.With the turn of the century, there has been recognition of the need to
move beyond technical solutions and to deal with the patterns anddrivers of unsustainable demand and consumption. This has resulted in
the emergence of a more integrated approach to environmentalmanagement, a focus on prevention (UNEP , 2007), the incorporation of
knowledge from the local to the global in environment policies
(Karlsson, 2007), and co-management and involvement of stakeholders
from all sectors in the management of natural resources (Plummer, 2006;
McConnell, 2008), although some have also questioned the efficacy of
this new paradigm (Armitage et al., 2007; Sandstrom, 2009).
2.5.3. Economic Dimensions
Economic vulnerability can be understood as the susceptibility of an
economic system, including public and private sectors, to potential(direct) disaster damage and loss (Rose, 2004; Mechler et al., 2010) and
refers to the inability of affected individuals, communities, businesses,and governments to absorb or cushion the damage (Rose, 2004). 
The degree of economic vulnerability is exhibited post-event by the
magnitude and duration of the indirect follow-on effects. These effectscan comprise business interruption costs to firms unable to accessinputs from their suppliers or service their customers, income losses ofhouseholds unable to get to work, or the deterioration of the fiscalstance post-disasters as less taxes are collected and significant publicrelief and reconstruction expenditure is required. At a macroeconomiclevel, adverse impacts include effects on gross domestic product (GDP),consumption, and the fiscal position (Mechler et al., 2010). Key driversof economic vulnerability are low levels of income and GDP , constrainedtax revenue, low domestic savings, shallow financial markets, and highindebtedness with little access to external finance (OAS, 1991; Bensonand Clay, 2000; Mechler, 2004).
Economic vulnerability to external shocks, including natural hazards,
has been inexactly defined in the literature and conceptualizationsoften have overlapped with risk, resilience, or exposure. One line ofresearch focusing on financial vulnerability, as a subset of economicvulnerability, framed the problem in terms of risk preference andaversion, a conceptualization more common to economists. Riskaversion, in this context, denotes the ability of economic agents toabsorb risk financially (Arrow and Lind, 1970). There are many ways toabsorb the financial burdens of disasters, with market-based insurancebeing one, albeit prominent, option, although more particularly in adeveloped country context. Households as economic agents often useinformal mechanisms relying on family and relatives abroad or outsidea disaster area; governments may simply rely on their tax base orinternational assistance. Yet, in the face of large and covariate risks,such ad hoc mechanisms often break down, particularly in developingcountries (see Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007). 
Research on financial vulnerability to disasters has hitherto focused
on developing countries’ financial vulnerability describing financialvulnerability as a country’s ability to access domestic and foreignsavings for financing post-disaster relief and reconstruction needs inorder to quickly recover and avoid substantial adverse ripple effects(Mechler et al., 2006; Marulanda et al., 2008a; Cardona, 2009; Cumminsand Mahul, 2009). Reported and estimated substantial financialvulnerability and risk aversion in many exposed countries, as well as theemergence of novel public-private partnership instruments for pricingand transferring catastrophe risks globally, has motivated developingcountry governments, as well as development institutions, NGOs, andother donor organizations, to consider pre-disaster financial instrumentsas an important component of disaster risk management (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005).
There is a distinct scale aspect to the economic dimension of exposure
and vulnerability. While evidence of the economic costs of knowndisasters indicate impacts may be under 10% of GDP (Wilbanks et al.,Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability872007), at smaller and more local scales the costs can be significantly
greater. A lack of good data makes it difficult to provide meaningful andspecific assessments other than to acknowledge that, without investmentin adaptation and resilience building measures, the intensification orincreased frequency of extreme weather events is bound to impact GDPgrowth in the future (Wilbanks et al., 2007).
Work and Livelihoods
At the individual and community levels, work and livelihoods are animportant facet of the economic dimension. These are often impactedby extreme events and by the responses to extreme events.Humanitarian/disaster relief in response to extreme events can induce
dependency and weaken local economic and social systems (Dudasik,
1982) but livelihood-based relief is of growing importance (Pantulianoand Wekesa, 2008). Further, there is increasing recognition thatdisasters and extreme events are stresses and shocks within livelihooddevelopment processes (Cannon et al., 2003; see Kelman and Mather,2008, for a discussion of cases applying to volcanic events).
Paavola’s (2008) analysis of livelihoods, vulnerability, and adaptation to
climate change in Morogoro, Tanzania, is indicative of the way extremeevents impact livelihoods in specific ways. Here, rural households arefound to be more vulnerable to climate variability and climate changethan are those in urban environments (see also Section 2.5.1.3). This isbecause rural incomes and consumption levels are significantly lower,there are greater levels of poverty, and more limited access to marketsand other services. More specifically, women are made more vulnerablethan men because they lack access to livelihoods other than climate-sensitive agriculture. Local people have employed a range of strategies(extensification, intensification, diversification, and migration) tomanage climate variability but these have sometimes had undesirableenvironmental outcomes, which have increased their vulnerability. Inthe absence of opportunities to fundamentally change their livelihoodoptions, we see here an example of short-term coping rather than long-term climate adaptation (Paavola, 2008). 
Human vulnerability to natural hazards and income poverty are largely
codependent (Adger, 1999; UNISDR, 2004) but poverty does not equalvulnerability in a simple way (e.g., Blaikie et al., 1994); the determinantsand dimensions of poverty are complex as well as its association with
climate change (Khandlhela and May, 2006; Demetriades and Esplen,2008; Hope, 2009). It is important to recognize that adaptation
measures need to specifically target climate extremes-poverty linkagesas not all poverty reduction measures reduce vulnerability to climate
extremes and vice versa. Further, measures are required across scales
because the drivers of poverty, although felt at a local level, maynecessitate tackling political and economic issues at a larger scale
(Eriksen and O’Brien, 2007; K. O’Brien et al., 2008). 
Given the relationship between poverty and vulnerability, it can be
argued (Tol et al., 2004) that economic growth could reduce vulnerability(with caveats). However, increasing economic growth would not
necessarily decrease climate impacts because it has the potential tosimultaneously increase greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore,growth is often reliant on critical infrastructure which itself may beaffected by extreme events. There are many questions still to beanswered by research about the impacts of varying economic policychanges including the pursuit of narrow development trajectoriesand how this might shape vulnerability (Tol et al., 2004; UNDP , 2004;UNISDR, 2004) 
2.5.4. Interactions, Cross-Cutting Themes, and Integrations
This section began by breaking down the vulnerability concept into itsconstitutive dimensions, with evidence derived from a number ofdiscrete research and policy communities (e.g., disaster risk reduction;climate change adaptation; environmental management; and povertyreduction) that have largely worked independently (Thomalla et al.,2006). Increasingly it is recognized that collaboration and integration isnecessary both to set appropriate policy agendas and to betterunderstand the topic of interest (K. O’Brien et al., 2008), althoughMcLaughlin and Dietz (2008) have made a critical analysis of theabsence of an integrated perspective on the interrelated dynamics ofsocial structure, human agency, and the environment.
Reviewing singular dimensions of vulnerability cannot provide an
appropriate level of synthesis. Considerable conceptual advances arosefrom the early recognition that so-called natural disasters were not‘natural’ at all (O’Keefe et al., 1976) but were the result of structuralinequalities rooted in political economy. This critique required analysisof more than the hazard component (Blaikie et al., 1994). Further, itdemonstrated how crossing disciplinary and other boundaries (e.g.,those separating disaster and development, or developed and developingcountries) can be fruitful in better understanding extremes of variouskinds (see Hewitt, 1983). If we consider food security/vulnerability (asjust one example), an inclusive analysis of the vulnerability of foodsystems (to put it broadly), must take account of aspects related to, inter
alia: physical location in susceptible areas; political economy (Watts and
Bohle, 1993); entitlements in access to resources (Sen, 1981); socialcapital and networks (Eriksen et al., 2005); landscape ecology (Fraser,2006); human ecology (Bohle et al., 1994); and political ecology (Pulwartyand Riebsame, 1997; Holling, 2001; see Chapter 4 for further discussionof food systems and food security). More generally, in relation to hazards,disaster risk reduction, and climate extremes, productive advances havebeen made in research adopting a coupled human/social-environmentsystems approach (Holling, 2001; Turner et al., 2003b) which recognizesthe importance of integrating often separate domains. For example, inanalyzing climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation inNorway, O’Brien et al. (2006) argue that a simple examination of directclimate change impacts underestimates the, perhaps more serious andlarger, synergistic impacts. They use an example of projected climatechange effects in the Barents Sea, which may directly impact keystonefish species. However, important as this finding is, climate change mayChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability88also influence the transport sector (through reduction in ice cover);
increase numbers of pollution events (through increased maritimetransport of oil and other goods); may risk ecological and other damagesas a result of competition from introduced species in ballast water;which, in turn, are aggravated by increases in ocean temperatures.Neither the potential level of impact nor the processes of adaptation arebest represented by a singular focus on a particular sector but mustconsider interactions between sectors and institutional, economic,social, and cultural conditions (O’Brien et al., 2006).
2.5.4.1. Intersectionality and Other Dimensions
The dimensions discussed above generate differential effects but it isimportant to consider not just differences between single categories(e.g., between women and men) but the differences within a given
category (e.g., ‘women’). This refers to intersectionality, where, forexample, gender may be a significant variable but only when allied withrace/ethnicity or some other variable. In Hurricane Katrina, it mattered(it still matters) whether you were black or white, upper class or work-ing class, home owner or renter, old or young, woman or man in termsof relative exposure and vulnerability factors (Cutter et al., 2006; Elliottand Pais, 2006).
Certain factors are identified as cross-cutting themes of particular
importance for understanding the dynamic changes within exposure,vulnerability, and risk. In the Sphere Project’s minimum standards inhumanitarian response, children, older people, persons with disabilities,gender, psychosocial issues, HIV and AIDS, and environment, climatechange, and disaster risk reduction are identified as cross-cuttingthemes and must be considered, not as separate sectors, which peoplemay or may not select for attention, but must be integrated within eachsector (Sphere Project, 2011). Exactly which topics are selected as cross-cutting themes, to be incorporated throughout an activity, is context-specific. Below, we consider just two: different timing (diachronicaspects within a single day or across longer time periods) and differentspatial and functional scales.
2.5.4.2. Timing, Spatial, and Functional Scales 
Cross-cutting themes of particular importance for understanding the
dynamic changes within exposure, vulnerability, and risk are differenttiming (diachronic aspects within a single day or across longer time
periods) and different spatial and functional scales.
2.5.4.2.1. Timing and timescales
Timing and timescales are important cross-cutting themes that needmore attention when dealing with the identification and management
of extreme climate and weather events, disasters, and adaptationstrategies. The first key issue when dealing with timing and timescalesis the fact that different hazards and their recurrence intervals might
fundamentally change in terms of the time dimension. This implies thatthe identification and assessment of risk, exposure, and vulnerabilityneeds also to deal with different time scales and in some cases mightneed to consider different time scales. At present most of the climatechange scenarios focus on climatic change within the next 100 or
200 years, while often the projections of vulnerability just use presentsocioeconomic data. However, a key challenge for enhancing knowledge
of exposure and vulnerability as key determinants of risk requiresimproved data and methods to project and identify directions anddifferent development pathways in demographic, socioeconomic, andpolitical trends that can adequately illustrate potential increases ordecreases in vulnerability with the same time horizon as the changes inthe climate system related to physical-biogeochemical projections (seeBirkmann et al., 2010b). 
Furthermore, the time dependency of risk analysis, particularly if the
analysis is conducted at a specific point in time, has been shown to becritical. Newer research underlines that exposure – especially theexposure of different social groups – is a highly dynamic element thatchanges not only seasonally, but also during the day and over differentdays of the week (e.g., Setiadi, 2011). Disasters also exacerbate pre-disaster trends in vulnerability (Colten et al., 2008).
Consequently, time scales and dynamic changes over time have to be
considered carefully when conducting risk and vulnerability assessmentsfor extreme events and creeping changes in the context of climate change.Additionally, changes in the hazard frequency and timing of hazardoccurrence during the year will have a strong impact on the ability ofsocieties and ecosystems to cope and adapt to these changes. 
The timing of events may also create ‘windows of vulnerability,’ periods in
which the hazards are greater because of the conjunction of circumstances(Dow, 1992). Time is a cross-cutting dimension that always needs to beconsidered but particularly so in the case of anthropogenic climate change,which may be projected some years into the future (Füssel, 2005). Infact, this time dimension is regarded (Thomalla et al., 2006) as a keydifference between the disaster management and climate changecommunities. To generalize somewhat, the former group typically(with obvious exceptions like slow-onset hazards such as drought ordesertification) deals with fast-onset events, in discrete, even if extensive,locations, requiring immediate action. The latter group typically focuses onconditions that occur in a dispersed form over lengthy time periods andwhich are much more challenging in their identification and measurement(Thomalla et al., 2006). Risk perception may be reduced (Leiserowitz,2006) for such events remote in time and/or space, such as some climatechange impacts are perceived to be. Thus, in this conceptualization,different time scales are an important constraint when dealing with thelink between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation (seeThomalla et al., 2006; Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010). 
However, it is important to also acknowledge that disaster risk reduction
considers risk reduction within different time frames; it encompassesChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability89short-term emergency management/response strategies and long-term
risk reduction strategies, for example, building structures to resist10,000-year earthquakes or flood barriers to resist 1,000-year stormsurges. Modern prospective risk management debates involve securityconsiderations decades ahead for production, infrastructure, houses,hospitals, etc.
2.5.4.2.2. Spatial and functional scales
Spatial and functional scales are another cross-cutting theme that is ofparticular relevance when dealing with the identification of exposure andvulnerability to extreme events and climate change. Leichenko and O’Brien(2002) conclude that in many areas of climate change and natural hazards
societies are confronted with dynamic vulnerability, meaning that
processes and factors that cause vulnerability operate simultaneously atmultiple scales making traditional indicators insufficient. Leichenko andO’Brien (2002) analyze a complex mix of influences (both positive andnegative) on the vulnerability, and coping and adaptive capacity ofsouthern African farmers in dealing with climate variability. Theseinclude the impacts of globalization on national-level policies and local-level experiences (e.g., structural adjustment programs reducing local-level agricultural subsidies on the one hand, and on the other, tradeliberalization measures opening up new opportunities throughdiversification of production in response to drought). Also Turner et al.(2003a,b) stress that vulnerability and resilience assessments need toconsider the influences on vulnerability from different scales, however,the practical application and analysis of these interacting influences onvulnerability from different spatial scales is a major challenge and in mostcases not sufficiently understood. Furthermore, vulnerability analysisparticularly linked to the identification of institutional vulnerability hasalso to take into account the various functional scales that climatechange, natural hazards, and vulnerability as well as administrativesystems operate on. In most cases, current disaster managementinstruments and measures of urban or spatial planning as well as watermanagement tools (specific plans, zoning, norms) operate on differentfunctional scales compared to climate change. Even the various hazardsthat climate change may modify encompass different functional scales
that cannot be sufficiently captured with one approach. For example,policy setting and management of climate change and of disaster risk
reduction are usually the responsibility of different institutions or
departments, thus it is a challenge to develop a coherent and integratedstrategy (Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010). Consequently, functional
and spatial scale mismatches might even be part of institutionalvulnerabilities that limit the ability of governance system to adequately
respond to hazards and changes induced by climate change. 
2.5.4.3. Science and Technology
Science and technology possess the potential to assist with adaptation
to extreme climate events, however there are a number of factors that
determine the ultimate utility of technology for adaptation. Theseinclude an understanding of the range of technologies available, the
identification of the appropriate role for technology, the process oftechnology transfer, and the criteria applied in selection of the technology(Klein et al., 2006). For major sectors such as water, agriculture, andhealth a range of possible so-called ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ technologies exist
such as irrigation and crop rotation pattern (Klein et al., 2006) or thedevelopment of drought-resistant crops (IAASTD, 2009) in the case of
the agricultural sector.
Although approaches alternative to pure science- and technology-
based ones have been suggested for decreasing vulnerability (Haqueand Etkin, 2007; Marshall and Picou, 2008), such as blending westernscience and technology with indigenous knowledge (Mercer et al., 2010)and ecological cautiousness and the creation of eco-technologies witha pro-nature, pro-poor, and pro-women orientation (Kesavan andSwaminathan, 2006), their efficacy in the context of risk and vulnerabilityreduction remain undetermined.
The increasing integration of a range of emerging weather and climate
forecasting products into early warning systems (Glantz, 2003) hashelped reduce exposure to extreme climate events because of anincreasing improvement of forecast skill over a range of time scales(Goddard et al., 2009; Stockdale et al., 2009; van Aalst, 2009; Barnstonet al., 2010; Hellmuth et al., 2011). Moreover, there is an increasing useof weather and climate information for planning and climate riskmanagement in business (Changnon and Changnon, 2010), foodsecurity (Verdin et al., 2005), and health (Ceccato et al., 2007; Degallieret al., 2010) as well as the use of technology for the development of arange of decision support tools for climate-related disaster management(van de Walle and Turoff, 2007). 
2.6. Risk Identification and Assessment 
Risk accumulation, dynamic changes in vulnerabilities, and the differentphases of crises and disaster situations constitute a complex environmentfor identifying and assessing risks and vulnerabilities, risk reductionmeasures, and adaptation strategies. Understanding of extreme eventsand disasters is a pre-requisite for the development of adaptationstrategies in the context of climate change and risk reduction in thecontext of disaster risk management. 
Current approaches to disaster risk management typically involve four
distinct public policies or components (objectives) (IDEA, 2005; Carreño,2006; IDB, 2007; Carreño et al., 2007b): 
1)Risk identification (involving individual perception, evaluation ofrisk, and social interpretation)
2)Risk reduction (involving prevention and mitigation of hazard orvulnerability)
3)Risk transfer (related to financial protection and in publicinvestment)
4)Disaster management (across the phases of preparedness, warnings,response, rehabilitation, and reconstruction after disasters). Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability90The first three actions are mainly ex ante – that is, they take place in
advance of disaster – and the fourth refers mainly to ex post actions,
although preparedness and early warning do require ex ante planning
(Cardona, 2004; IDB, 2007). Risk identification, through vulnerability and
risk assessment can produce common understanding by the stakeholdersand actors. It is the first step for risk reduction, prevention, and transfer,
as well as climate adaptation in the context of extremes.
2.6.1. Risk Identification
Understanding risk factors and communicating risks due to climatechange to decisionmakers and the general public are key challenges.These challenges include developing an improved understanding ofunderlying vulnerabilities, and societal coping and response capacities. 
There is high confidence that the selection of appropriate vulnerability
and risk evaluation approaches depends on the decisionmaking context.The promotion of a higher level of risk awareness regarding climatechange-induced hazards and changes requires an improved understandingof the specific risk perceptions of different social groups and individuals,including those factors that influence and determine these perceptions,such as beliefs, values, and norms. This also requires attention forappropriate formats of communication that characterize uncertaintyand complexity (see, e.g., Patt et al., 2005; Bohle and Glade, 2008; Renn,2008, pp. 289; Birkmann et al., 2009; ICSU-LAC, 2011a,b, p. 15). 
Appropriate information and knowledge are essential prerequisites for
risk-aware behavior and decisions. Specific information and knowledgeon the dynamic interactions of exposed and vulnerable elementsinclude livelihoods and critical infrastructures, and potentially damagingevents, such as extreme weather events or potential irreversiblechanges such as sea level rise. Based on the expertise of disaster riskresearch and findings in the climate change and climate changeadaptation community, requirements for risk understanding related toclimate change and extreme events particularly encompass knowledgeof various elements (Kasperson et al., 2005; Patt et al., 2005; Renn andGraham, 2006; Biermann, 2007; Füssel, 2007; Bohle and Glade, 2008;Cutter and Finch, 2008; Renn, 2008; Biermann et al., 2009, Birkmann etal., 2009, 2010b; Cardona, 2010; Birkmann, 2011a; ICSU-LAC, 2011a,b),
including:
•Processes by which persons, property, infrastructure, goods, andthe environment itself are exposed to potentially damaging events,
for example, understanding exposure in its spatial and temporaldimensions.
•Factors and processes that determine or contribute to thevulnerability of persons and their livelihoods or of socio-ecological
systems. This includes an understanding of increases or decreases
in susceptibility and response capacity, including the distribution ofsocio- and economic resources that make people more vulnerableor that increase their level of resilience.
•How climate change affects hazards, particularly regardingprocesses by which human activities in the natural environment orchanges in socio-ecological systems lead to the creation of new
hazards (e.g., NaTech hazards), irreversible changes, or increasingprobabilities of hazard events occurrence.
• Different tools, methodologies, and sources of knowledge (e.g.,
expert/scientific knowledge, local or indigenous knowledge) that
allow capturing new hazards, risk, and vulnerability profiles, as well
as risk perceptions. In this context, new tools and methodologiesare also needed that allow for the evaluation, for example, of newrisks (sea level rise) and of current adaptation strategies.
• How risks and vulnerabilities can be modified and reconfigured
through forms of governance, particularly risk governance –encompassing formal and informal rule systems and actornetworks at various levels. Furthermore, it is essential to improveknowledge on how to promote adaptive governance within theframework of risk assessment and risk management.
• Adaptive capacity status and limits of adaptation. This includes the
need to assess potential capacities for future hazards and fordealing with uncertainty. Additionally, more knowledge is neededon the various and socially differentiated limits of adaptation.These issues also imply an improved understanding on how differentadaptation measures influence resilience and adaptive capacities. 
2.6.2. Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
The development of modern risk analysis and assessments were closelylinked to the establishment of scientific methodologies for identifyingcausal links between adverse health effects and different types ofhazardous events and the mathematical theories of probability (Covelloand Mumpower, 1985). Today, risk and vulnerability assessmentsencompass a broad and multidisciplinary research field. In this regard,vulnerability and risk assessments can have different functions andgoals. 
Risk and vulnerability assessment depend on the underlying
understanding of the terms. In this context, two main schools ofthought can be differentiated. The first school of thought defines riskas a decision by an individual or a group to act in such a way that theoutcome of these decisions can be harmful (Luhmann, 2003; Dikau andPohl, 2007). In contrast, the disaster risk research community views riskas the product of the interaction of a potentially damaging event andthe vulnerable conditions of a society or element exposed (UNISDR,2004; IPCC, 2007).
Vulnerability and risk assessment encompass various approaches and
techniques ranging from indicator-based global or national assessmentsto qualitative participatory approaches of vulnerability and risk assessmentat the local level. They serve different functions and goals (see IDEA,2005; Birkmann, 2006a; Cardona, 2006; Dilley, 2006; Wisner, 2006a;IFRC, 2008; Peduzzi et al., 2009). 
Risk assessment at the local level presents specific challenges related to
a lack of data (including climate data at sufficient resolution, but alsoChapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability91socioeconomic data at the lowest levels of aggregation) but also the
highly complex and dynamic interplay between the capacities of thecommunities (and the way they are distributed among communitymembers, including their power relationships) and the challenges theyface (including both persistent and acute aspects of vulnerability). 
To inform risk management, it is desirable that risk assessments are
locally based and result in increased awareness and a sense of localownership of the process and the options that may be employed toaddress the risks. Several participatory risk assessment methods, oftenbased on participatory rural appraisal methods, have been adjusted toexplicitly address changing risks in a changing climate. Examples ofguidance on how to assess climate vulnerability at the community levelare available from several sources (see Willows and Connell, 2003;Moench and Dixit, 2007; van Aalst et al., 2007; CARE, 2009; IISD et al.,2009; Tearfund, 2009). In integrating climate change, a balance needs tobe struck between the desire for a sophisticated assessment that includeshigh-quality scientific inputs and rigorous analysis of the participatoryfindings, and the need to keep the process simple, participatory, andimplementable at scale. Chapter 5 provides further details on theimplementation of risk management at local levels. 
The International Standards Organization defines risk assessment as a
process to comprehend the nature of risk and to determine the level ofrisk (ISO, 2009a,b). Additionally, communication within risk assessmentand management are seen as key elements of the process (Renn, 2008).More specifically, vulnerability and risk assessment deal with theidentification of different facets and factors of vulnerability and risk, bymeans of gathering and systematizing data and information, in order tobe able to identify and evaluate different levels of vulnerability and riskof societies – social groups and infrastructures – or coupled socio-ecological systems at risk. A common goal of vulnerability and riskassessment approaches is to provide information about profiles, patternsof, and changes in risk and vulnerability (see, e.g., IDEA, 2005; Birkmann,2006a; Cardona ,2008; IFRC, 2008), in order to define priorities, select
alternative strategies, or formulate new response strategies. In thiscontext, the Hyogo Framework for Action stresses “that the startingpoint for reducing disaster risk and for promoting a culture of disaster
resilience lies in the knowledge of the hazards and the physical, social,
economic, and environmental vulnerabilities to disasters that mostsocieties face, and of the ways in which hazards and vulnerabilities are
changing in the short and long term, followed by action taken on the
basis of that knowledge” (UN, 2005). 
Vulnerability and risk assessments are key strategic activities that
inform both disaster risk management and climate change adaptation.These require the use of reliable methodologies that allow an adequate
estimation and quantification of potential losses and consequences to
the human systems in a given exposure time. 
Risk estimates are thus intended to be prospective, anticipating
scientifically possible hazard events that may occur in the future.
Usually technical risk analyses have been associated with probabilities.Taking into account epistemic and aleatory uncertainties the probabilistic
estimations of risk attempt to forecast damage or losses even whereinsufficient data are available on the hazards and the system beinganalyzed (UNDRO, 1980; Fournier d’Albe, 1985; Spence and Coburn,1987; Blockley, 1992; Coburn and Spence, 1992; Sheldon and Golding,1992; Woo, 1999; Grossi and Kunreuther, 2005; Cardona et al., 2008a,b;Cardona 2011). In most cases, approaches and criteria for simplificationand for aggregation of different information types and sources are used,due to a lack of data or the inherent low resolution of the information. Thiscan result in some scientific or technical and econometric characteristics,accuracy, and completeness that are desirable features when the riskevaluation is the goal of the process (Cardona et al., 2003b). Measuressuch as loss exceedance curves and probable maximum loss for differentevent return periods are of particular importance for the stratification ofrisk and the design of disaster risk intervention strategy considering riskreduction, prevention, and transfer (Woo, 1999; Grossi and Kunreuther,2005; Cardona et al., 2008a,b; ERN-AL, 2011; UNISDR, 2011). However,it is also evident that more qualitative-oriented risk assessmentapproaches are focusing on deterministic approaches and the profilingof vulnerability using participatory methodologies (Garret, 1999).
Vulnerability and risk indicators or indices are feasible techniques for
risk monitoring and may take into account both the harder aspects ofrisk as well as its softer aspects. The usefulness of indicators dependson how they are employed to make decisions on risk managementobjectives and goals (Cardona et al., 2003a; IDEA, 2005; Cardona, 2006,2008, 2010; Carreño et al., 2007b).
However, quantitative approaches for assessing vulnerability need to be
complemented with qualitative approaches to capture the full complexityand the various tangible and intangible aspects of vulnerability in itsdifferent dimensions. It is important to recognize that complex systemsinvolve multiple variables (physical, social, cultural, economic, andenvironmental) that cannot be measured using the same methodology.Physical or material reality have a harder topology that allows the useof quantitative measure, while collective and historical reality have asofter topology in which the majority of the attributes are described inqualitative terms (Munda, 2000). These aspects indicate that a weighingor measurement of risk involves the integration of diverse disciplinaryperspectives. An integrated and interdisciplinary focus can moreconsistently take into account the nonlinear relations of the parameters,the context, complexity, and dynamics of social and environmental systems,and contribute to more effective risk management by the differentstakeholders involved in risk reduction or adaptation decisionmaking.Results can be verified and risk management/adaptation priorities canbe established (Carreño et al., 2007a, 2009).
To ensure that risk and vulnerability assessments are also understood,
the key challenges for future vulnerability and risk assessments, in thecontext of climate change, are, in particular, the promotion of moreintegrative and holistic approaches; the improvement of assessmentmethodologies that also account for dynamic changes in vulnerability,exposure, and risk; and the need to address the requirements of

Box 2-3 | Developing a Regional Common Operating Picture of Vulnerability
in the Americas for Various Kinds of Decisionmakers
The Program of Indicators of Disaster Risk and Risk Management for the Americas of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDEA, 2 005;
Cardona, 2008, 2010) provides a holistic approach to relative vulnerability assessment using social, economic, and environmenta l indica tors
and a metric for sovereign fiscal vulnerability assessment taking into account that extreme impacts can generate financial defi cit due to
a sudden elevated need for resources to restore affected inventories or capital stock. 
The Prevalent Vulnerability Index (PVI) depicts predominant vulnerability conditions of the countries over time to identify pro gresses and
regressions. It provides a measure of direct effects (as result of exposure and susceptibility) as well as indirect and intangi ble effects of
hazard events (as result of socioeconomic fragilities and lack of resilience). The indicators used are made up of a set of demo graphic,
socioeconomic, and environmental national indicators that reflect situations, causes, susceptibilities, weaknesses, or relative  absences of
development affecting the country under study. The indicators are selected based on existing indices, figures, or rates availab le from
reliable worldwide databases or data provided by each country. These vulnerability conditions underscore the relationship betwe en risk
and development. Figure 2-1 shows the aggregated PVI (Exposure, Social Fragility, Lack of Resilience) for 2007. 
Vulnerability and therefore risk are also the result of unsustainable economic growth and deficiencies that may be corrected by  means of
adequate development processes, reducing susceptibility of exposed assets, socioeconomic fragilities, and improving capacities and
resilience of society (IDB, 2007). The information provided by an index such as the PVI can prove useful to ministries of housi ng and
urban development, environment, agriculture, health and social welfare, economy, and planning. The main advantage of PVI lies i n its
ability to disaggregate results and identify factors that may take priority in risk management actions as corrective and prospe ctive measures
or interventions of vulnerability from a development point of view. The PVI can be used at different territorial levels, howeve r often the
indicators used by the PVI are only available at the national level; this is a limitation for its application at other sub-nati onal scales. 
On the other hand, future disasters have been identified as contingency liabilities and could be included in the balance of eac h nation.

Continued next page93decisionmakers and the general public. Many assessments still focus
solely on one dimension, such as economic risk and vulnerability. Thus,
they consider a very limited set of vulnerability factors and dimensions.Some approaches, e.g., at the global level, view vulnerability primarily withregard to the degree of experienced loss of life and economic damage (see
Dilley et al., 2005; Dilley 2006). A more integrative and holistic perspectivecaptures a greater range of dimensions and factors of vulnerability and
disaster risk. Successful adaptation to climate change has been basedon a multi-dimensional perspective, encompassing, for example, social,economic, environmental, and institutional aspects. Hence, risk andvulnerability assessments – that intend to inform these adaptationstrategies – require also a multi-dimensional perspective.Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability
reposition costs are liabilities that become materialized when the hazard events occur. The Disaster Deficit Index (DDI) provid es an
estimation of the extreme impact (due to hurricane, floods, tsunami, earthqua ke, etc.) during a given exposure time and the financial
ability to cope with such a situation. The DDI captures the relationship between the loss that the country could experience whe n an
extreme impact occurs (demand for contingent resources) and the public sector’s economic resilience – that is, the availability of funds
to address the situation (restoring affected inventories). This macroeconomic risk metric underscores the relationship between extreme
impacts and the capacity to cope of the government. Figure 2-2 shows the DDI for 2008. 
A DDI greater than 1.0 reflects the country’s inability to cope with extreme disasters, even when it would go into as much debt  as
possible: the greater the DDI, the greater the gap between the potential losses and the country’s ability to face them. This di saster risk
figure is interesting and useful for a Ministry of Finance and Economics. It is related to the potential financial sustainabili ty problem of
the country regarding the potential disasters. On the other hand, the DDI gives a compressed picture of the fiscal vulnerabilit y of the
country due to extreme impacts. The DDI has been a guide for economic risk management; the results at national and sub-national  levels
can be studied by economic, financial, and planning analysts, who can evaluate the potential budget problem and the need to tak e into
account these figures in the financial planning.

been developed by Turner et al. (2003a), Birkmann (2006b), and Cardona(2001). Key elements of these holistic views are the identification ofcausal linkages between factors of vulnerability and risk and theinterventions (structural, non-structural) that nations, societies, andcommunities or individuals make to reduce their vulnerability or exposureto hazards. Turner et al. (2003a) underline the need to focus on differentscales simultaneously, in order to capture the linkages between differentscales (local, national, regional, etc.). The influences and linkagesbetween different scales can be difficult to capture, especially due totheir dynamic nature during and after disasters, for example, throughinputs of external disaster aid (Cardona, 1999a,b; Cardona and Barbat,2000; Turner et al., 2003a; Carreño et al., 2005, 2007a, 2009; IDEA,2005; Birkmann, 2006b; ICSU-LAC, 2011a,b). 
Several methods have been proposed to measure vulnerability from a
comprehensive and multidisciplinary perspective. In some cases compositeindices or indicators intend to capture favorable conditions for directphysical impacts – such as exposure and susceptibility – as well as indirector intangible impacts of hazard events – such as socio-ecological fragilitiesor lack of resilience (IDEA, 2005; Cardona, 2006; Carreño et al., 2007a).In these holistic approaches, exposure and physical susceptibility arerepresenting the ‘hard’ and hazard-dependent conditions of vulnerability.On the other hand, the propensity to suffer negative impacts as a resultof the socio-ecological fragilities and not being able to adequately copeand anticipate future disasters can be considered ‘soft’ and usuallynon-hazard dependent conditions, that aggravate the impact. Box 2-3describes two of these approaches, based on relative indicators, usefulfor monitoring vulnerability of countries over time and to communicateit to country’s development and financial authorities in their ownlanguage.
To enhance disaster risk management and climate change adaptation,
risk identification and vulnerability assessment may be undertaken indifferent phases, that is, before, during, and even after disasters occur.This includes, for instance, the evaluation of the continued viability ofmeasures taken and the need for further or different adaptation/riskmanagement measures. Although risk and vulnerability reduction are theprimary actions to be conducted before disasters occur, it is important
to acknowledge that ex post and forensic studies of disasters provide a
laboratory in which to study risk and disasters as well as vulnerabilitiesrevealed (see Birkmann and Fernando, 2008; ICSU-LAC, 2011a,b).Disasters draw attention to how societies and socio-ecological processesare changing and acting in crises and catastrophic situations, particularlyregarding the reconfiguration of access to different assets or the role
of social networks and formal organizations (see Bohle, 2008). It is
noteworthy that, until today, many post-disaster processes and strategieshave failed to integrate aspects of climate change adaptation and long-term risk reduction (see Birkmann et al., 2009, 2010a). 
In the broader context of the assessments and evaluations, it is also
crucial to improve the different methodologies to measure and evaluate
hazards, vulnerability, and risks. The disaster risk research has paid moreattention to sudden-onset hazards and disasters such as floods, storms,
tsunamis, etc., and less on the measurement of creeping changes andintegrating the issue of tipping points into these assessments (see alsoSection 3.1.7). Therefore, the issue of measuring vulnerability and risk, interms of quantitative and qualitative measures also remains a challenge.Lastly, the development of appropriate assessment indicators andevaluation criteria would also be strengthened if respective integrativeand consistent goals for vulnerability reduction and climate changeadaptation could be defined for specific regions, such as coastal,mountain, or arid environments. Most assessments to date have basedtheir judgment and evaluation on a relative comparison of vulnerability
levels between different social groups or regions.
There is medium evidence (given the generally limited amount of
long-term evaluations of impacts of adaptation and risk managementinterventions and complications associated with such assessments), buthigh agreement that adaptation and risk management policies and
practices will be more successful if they take the dynamic nature ofvulnerability and exposure into account, including the explicitcharacterization of uncertainty and complexity (Cardona 2001, 2011;Hilhorst, 2004, ICSU-LAC, 2010, Pelling, 2010). Projections of the impactsof climate change can be strengthened by including storylines of changingvulnerability and exposure under different development pathways.Appropriate attention to the dynamics of vulnerability and exposure isparticularly important given that the design and implementation ofadaptation and risk management strategies and policies can reduce riskin the short term, but may increase vulnerability and exposure over thelonger term. For instance, dike systems can reduce hazard exposure byoffering immediate protection, but also encourage settlement patternsthat may increase risk in the long term. For instance, in the 40-year spanbetween Hurricanes Betsy and Katrina, protective works – new andimproved levees, drainage pumps, and canals – successfully protectedNew Orleans and surrounding parishes against three hurricanes in 1985,1997, and 1998. These works were the basis for the catastrophe ofKatrina, having enabled massive development of previously unprotectedareas and the flooding of these areas that resulted when the worksthemselves were shown to be inadequate (Colten et al., 2008). For otherexamples, see Décamps (2010).
The design of public policy on disaster risk management is related to the
method of evaluation used to orient policy formulation. If the diagnosisinvites action it is much more effective than where the results are limitedto identifying the simple existence of weaknesses or failures. The mainquality attributes of a risk model are represented by its applicability ,
transparency , presentation, and legitimacy (Corral, 2000). For more
details see Cardona (2004, 2011).
Several portfolio-level climate risk assessment methods for development
agencies have paid specific attention to the risk of variability andextremes (see, e.g., Burton and van Aalst, 1999, 2004; Klein, 2001; vanAalst, 2006b; Klein et al., 2007; Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Tanner,2009). Given the planning horizons of most development projects(typically up to about 20 years), even if the physical lifetime of the
Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability95investment may be much longer, and need to combine attention to current
and future risks, these tools provide linkages between adaptation toclimate change and enhanced disaster risk management even in light ofcurrent hazards. For more details on the implementation of riskmanagement at the national level, see Chapter 6.
2.6.3. Risk Communication
How people perceive a specific risk is a key issue for risk managementand climate change adaptation effectiveness (e.g., Burton et al., 1993;Alexander, 2000; Kasperson and Palmlund, 2005; van Sluis and van Aalst,2006; ICSU-LAC, 2011a,b) since responses are shaped by perception ofrisk (Grothmann and Patt, 2005; Wolf et al., 2010b; Morton et al., 2011). 
Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary field that involves
reaching different audiences to make risk comprehensible, understandingand respecting audience values, predicting the audience’s response tothe communication, and improving awareness and collective andindividual decisionmaking (e.g., Cardona, 1996c; Mileti, 1996; Greiving,2002; Renn, 2008). Risk communication failures have been revealed inpast disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the Pakistan floodsin 2010 (DKKV, 2011). Particularly, the loss of trust in official institutionsresponsible for early warning and disaster management were a keyfactor that contributed to the increasing disaster risk. Effective andpeople-centered risk communication is therefore a key to improvevulnerability and risk reduction in the context of extreme events,particularly in the context of people-centered early warning (DKKV,2011). Weak and insufficient risk communication as well as the loss oftrust in government institutions in the context of early warning or climatechange adaptation can be seen as a core component of institutionalvulnerability. 
Risk assessments and risk identification have to be linked to different types
and strategies of risk communication. Risk communication or the failureof effective and people-centered risk communication can contribute to
an increasing vulnerability and disaster risk. Knowledge on factors that
determine how people perceive and respond to a specific risk or a set
of multi-hazard risks is key for risk management and climate change
adaptation (see Grothmann and Patt 2005; van Aalst et al., 2008). 
Understanding the ways in which disasters are framed requires more
information and communication about vulnerability factors, dynamic
temporal and spatial changes of vulnerability, and the coping and
response capacities of societies or social-ecological systems at risk (seeTurner et al., 2003a; Birkmann, 2006a,b,c; Cardona, 2008; Cutter andFinch, 2008; ICSU-LAC, 2011a,b). ‘Framing’ refers to the way a particularproblem is presented or viewed. Frames are shaped by knowledge ofand underlying views of the world (Schon and Rein, 1994). It is related
to the organization of knowledge that people have about their world inthe light of their underlying attitudes toward key social values (e.g.,nature, peace, freedom), their notions of agency and responsibility (e.g.,individual autonomy, corporate responsibility), and their judgments aboutreliability, relevance, and weight of competing knowledge claims (Jasanoff
and Wynne, 1997). ‘Early warning’ implies information interventionsinto an environment in which much about vulnerability is assumed. Inthis regard, risk communication is not solely linked to a top-downcommunication process, rather effective risk communication requiresrecognition of communication as a social process meaning that riskcommunication also deals with local risk perceptions and local framingof risk. Risk communication thus functions also as a tool to upscale localknowledge and needs (bottom-up approach). Therefore, effective riskcommunication achieves both informing people at risk about the keydeterminants of their particular risks and of impending disaster risk (earlywarning), and also engages different stakeholders in the definition of aproblem and the identification of respective solutions (see van Aalst et al.,2008).
Climate change adaptation strategies as well as disaster risk reduction
approaches need public interest, leadership, and acceptance. Thegeneration and receipt of risk information occurs through a diverse arrayof channels. Chapter 5 and others discuss the important role of massmedia and other sources (see, e.g., the case of Japan provided in Sampeiand Aoyagi-Usui, 2009). Within the context of risk communication,particularly in terms of climate change and disasters, decisionmakers,scientists, and NGOs have to act in accordance with media requirementsconcerning news production, public discourse, and media consumption(see Carvalho and Burgess, 2005). Carvalho (2005) and Olausson (2009)underline that mass media is often closely linked to political awarenessand is framed by its own journalistic norms and priorities; that meansalso that mass media provides little space for alternative frames ofcommunicating climate change (Carvalho, 2005; Olausson, 2009).Boykoff and Boykoff (2007) conclude that this process might also leadto an informational bias, especially toward the presentation of eventsinstead of a comprehensive analysis of the problem. Thus, an importantaspect of improving risk communication and the respective knowledgebase is the acceptance and admission of the limits of knowledge aboutthe future (see Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010). 
2.7. Risk Accumulation and
the Nature of Disasters
The concept of risk accumulation describes a gradual build-up of disaster
risk in specific locations, often due to a combination of processes, somepersistent and/or gradual, others more erratic, often in a combination ofexacerbation of inequality, marginalization, and disaster risk over time(Maskrey, 1993b; Lavell, 1994). It also reflects that the impacts of onehazard – and the response to it – can have implications for how thenext hazard plays out. This is well illustrated by the example of ElSalvador, where people living in temporary shelters after the 1998Hurricane Mitch were at greater risk during the 2001 earthquakes dueto the poor construction of the shelters (Wisner, 2001b). The concept ofrisk accumulation acknowledges the multiple causal factors of risk bythe connecting development patterns and risk, as well as the linksbetween one disaster and the next.Chapter 2 Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability96Risk accumulation can be driven by underlying factors such as a decline
in the regulatory services provided by ecosystems, inadequate watermanagement, land use changes, rural-urban migration, unplannedurban growth, the expansion of informal settlements in low-lying areas,and an underinvestment in drainage infrastructure. Development andgovernance processes that increase the marginalization of specificgroups, for example, through the reduction of access to health servicesor the exclusion from information and power – to name just a few – canalso severely increase the susceptibility of these groups and at the sametime erode societal response capacities. The classic example is disasterrisk in urban areas in many rapidly growing cities in developing countries(Pelling and Wisner, 2009b). In these areas, disaster risk is often veryunequally distributed, with the poor facing the highest risk, for instancebecause they live in the most hazard-prone parts of the city, often inunplanned dense settlements with a lack of public services; where lackof waste disposal may lead to blocking of drains and increases the riskof disease outbreaks when floods occur; with limited political influenceto ensure government interventions to reduce risk. The accumulation ofdisaster risk over time may be partly caused by a string of smallerdisasters due to continued exposure to small day-to-day risks in urbanareas (e.g., Pelling and Wisner, 2009a), aggravated by limited resourcesto cope and recover from disasters when they occur – creating a viciouscycle of poverty and disaster risk. Analysis of disaster loss data suggeststhat frequent low-intensity losses often highlight an accumulation of risks,which is then realized when an extreme hazard event occurs (UNISDR,2009a). Similar accumulation of risk may occur at larger scales in hazard-prone states, especially in the context of conflict and displacement (e.g.,UNDP , 2004).
A context-based understanding of these risks is essential to identify
appropriate risk management strategies. This may include better collectionof sub-national disaster data that allows visualization of complex patternsof local risk (UNDP , 2004), as well as locally owned processes of riskidentification and reduction. Bull-Kamanga et al. (2003) suggest thatone of the most effective methods to address urban disaster risk inAfrica is to support community processes among the most vulnerablegroups so they can identify risks and set priorities – both for communityaction and for action by external agencies (including local governments).Such local risk assessment processes also avoid the pitfalls of planning
based on dated maps used to plan and develop large physical constructionand facilities.
Disaster risk is not an autonomous or externally generated circumstance
to which society reacts, adapts, or responds (as is the case with naturalphenomena or events per se), but rather the result of the interaction of
society and the natural or built environment. Thus disasters are often
the product of parallel developments that sometimes reach a tipping
point, where the cumulative effect of these parallel processes results in
disaster (Dikau and Pohl, 2007; Birkmann, 2011b). After that point,
recovery may be slowed by conflict between processes and goals of
reconstruction (Colten et al., 2008). In addition, there is often strong
pressure to restore the status quo as soon as possible after a disaster
has happened, even if that status quo means continued high levels ofdisaster risk. Sometimes, however, disasters themselves can be a
window of opportunity for addressing the determinants of disaster risk.With proactive risk assessment and reconstruction planning, moreappropriate solutions can be realized while restoring essential assetsand services during and after disasters (Susman et al., 1983, Renn,1992; Comfort et al., 1999; Vogel and O’Brien, 2004).

Table of Contents111This chapter addresses changes in weather and climate events relevant to extreme impacts and disasters.
An extreme (weather or climate) event is generally defined as the occurrence of a value of a weather or climatevariable above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends (‘tails’) of the range of observed values ofthe variable. Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the result of an accumulation of weather or climate
events that are, individually, not extreme themselves (though their accumulation is extreme). As well, weather orclimate events, even if not extreme in a statistical sense, can still lead to extreme conditions or impacts, either bycrossing a critical threshold in a social, ecological, or physical system, or by occurring simultaneously with otherevents. A weather system such as a tropical cyclone can have an extreme impact, depending on where and when itapproaches landfall, even if the specific cyclone is not extreme relative to other tropical cyclones. Conversely, not allextremes necessarily lead to serious impacts. [3.1]
Many weather and climate extremes are the result of natural climate variability (including phenomena
such as El Niño), and natural decadal or multi-decadal variations in the climate provide the backdrop foranthropogenic climate changes. Even if there were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a wide variety of natural
weather and climate extremes would still occur. [3.1]
A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of
weather and climate extremes, and can result in unprecedented extremes. Changes in extremes can also be
directly related to changes in mean climate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projected to liewithin the tails of present-day conditions. Nevertheless, changes in extremes of a climate or weather variable are notalways related in a simple way to changes in the mean of the same variable, and in some cases can be of oppositesign to a change in the mean of the variable. Changes in phenomena such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation ormonsoons could affect the frequency and intensity of extremes in several regions simultaneously. [3.1]
Many factors affect confidence in observed and projected changes in extremes. Our confidence in observed
changes in extremes depends on the quality and quantity of available data and the availability of studies analyzingthese data. It consequently varies between regions and for different extremes. Similarly, our confidence in projectingchanges (including the direction and magnitude of changes in extremes) varies with the type of extreme, as well asthe considered region and season, depending on the amount and quality of relevant observational data and modelprojections, the level of understanding of the underlying processes, and the reliability of their simulation in models(assessed from expert judgment, model validation, and model agreement). Global-scale trends in a specific extrememay be either more reliable (e.g., for temperature extremes) or less reliable (e.g., for droughts) than some regional-scale trends, depending on the geographical uniformity of the trends in the specific extreme. ‘ Low confidence ’ in
observed or projected changes in a specific extreme neither implies nor excludes the possibility of changes in this
extreme. [3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.2.3; Box 3-2; Figures 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-10]
There is evidence from observations gathered since 1950 of change in some extremes. It is very likely that
there has been an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights, and an overall increase in the number of
warm days and nights, at the global scale, that is, for most land areas with sufficient data. It is likely that these changes
have also occurred at the continental scale in North America, Europe, and Australia. There is medium confidence of a
warming trend in daily temperature extremes in much of Asia. Confidence in observed trends in daily temperature
extremes in Africa and South America generally varies from lowto medium depending on the region. Globally, in many
(but not all) regions with sufficient data there is medium confidence that the length or number of warm spells or heat
waves has increased since the middle of the 20th century. It is likely that there have been statistically significant
increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g., 95th percentile) in more regions than there have been
statistically significant decreases, but there are strong regional and subregional variations in the trends. There is
low confidence that any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity are robust,
after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. It is likely that there has been a poleward shift in the
main Northern and Southern Hemisphere extratropical storm tracks. There is low confidence in observed trends inChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
Executive Summary112small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail because of data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in monitoring
systems. There is medium confidence that since the 1950s some regions of the world have experienced a trend to
more intense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions droughtshave become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example, in central North America and northwestern Australia.There is limited to medium evidence available to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude andfrequency of floods at regional scales because the available instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limitedin space and time, and because of confounding effects of changes in land use and engineering. Furthermore, there islow agreement in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of these
changes. It is likely that there has been an increase in extreme coastal high water related to increases in mean sea
level in the late 20th century. [3.2.1, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3; Tables 3-1, 3-2]
There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including
increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. It is likely that anthropogenic influences have led
to warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale. There is medium confidence
that anthropogenic influences have contributed to intensification of extreme precipitation at the global scale. It islikely that there has been an anthropogenic influence on increasing extreme coastal high water due to an increase in
mean sea level. The uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, the incomplete understanding of the physicalmechanisms linking tropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree of tropical cyclone variability provideonly low confidence for the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic
influences. Attribution of single extreme events to anthropogenic climate change is challenging. [3.2.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2,3.4.4, 3.5.3; Table 3-1]
The following assessments of the likelihood of and/or confidence in projections are generally for the end
of the 21st century and relative to the climate at the end of the 20th century. There are three main sources of
uncertainty in the projections: the natural variability of climate; uncertainties in climate model parameters andstructure; and projections of future emissions. Projections for differing emissions scenarios generally do not stronglydiverge in the coming two to three decades, but uncertainty in the sign of change is relatively large over this timeframe because climate change signals are expected to be relatively small compared to natural climate variability. Forcertain extremes (e.g., precipitation-related extremes), the uncertainty in projected changes by the end of the 21stcentury is more the result of uncertainties in climate models rather than uncertainties in future emissions. For otherextremes (in particular temperature extremes at the global scale and in most regions), the emissions uncertainties arethe main source of uncertainty in projections for the end of the 21st century. In the assessments provided in thischapter, uncertainties in projections from the direct evaluation of multi-model ensemble projections are modified bytaking into account the past performance of models in simulating extremes (for instance, simulations of late 20th-century changes in extreme temperatures appear to overestimate the observed warming of warm extremes andunderestimate the warming of cold extremes), the possibility that some important processes relevant to extremes maybe missing or be poorly represented in models, and the limited number of model projections and correspondinganalyses currently available of extremes. For these reasons the assessed uncertainty is generally greater than would be
assessed from the model projections alone. Low-probability, high-impact changes associated with the crossing of
poorly understood climate thresholds cannot be excluded, given the transient and complex nature of the climate
system. Feedbacks play an important role in either damping or enhancing extremes in several climate variables.
[3.1.4, 3.1.7, 3.2.3, 3.3.1, 3.3.2; Box 3-2]
Models project substantial warming in temperature extremes by the end of the 21st century. It is virtually
certain that increases in the frequency and magnitude of warm daily temperature extremes and decreases in cold
extremes will occur through the 21st century at the global scale. It is very likely that the length, frequency, and/or
intensity of warm spells or heat waves will increase over most land areas. For the Special Report on Emissions
Scenarios (SRES) A2 and A1B emission scenarios, a 1-in-20 year annual hottest day is likely to become a 1-in-2 year
annual extreme by the end of the 21st century in most regions, except in the high latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere where it is likely to become a 1-in-5 year annual extreme. In terms of absolute values, 20-year extreme
annual daily maximum temperature (i.e., return value) will likely increase by about 1 to 3°C by mid-21st century and
by about 2 to 5°C by the late 21st century, depending on the region and emissions scenario (considering the B1, A1B,Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment113and A2 scenarios). Regional changes in temperature extremes will often differ from the mean global temperature
change. [3.3.1; Table 3-3; Figure 3-5]
It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy rainfalls
will increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe. This is particularly the case in the high latitudes
and tropical regions, and in winter in the northern mid-latitudes. Heavy rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones arelikely to increase with continued warming induced by enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations. There is medium
confidence that, in some regions, increases in heavy precipitation will occur despite projected decreases in total
precipitation. For a range of emission scenarios (SRES A2, A1B, and B1), a 1-in-20 year annual maximum 24-hourprecipitation rate is likely to become a 1-in-5 to 1-in-15 year event by the end of the 21st century in many regions,
and in most regions the higher emissions scenarios (A1B and A2) lead to a greater projected decrease in returnperiod. Nevertheless, increases or statistically non-significant changes in return periods are projected in some regions.[3.3.2; Table 3-3; Figure 3-7]
There is generally low confidence in projections of changes in extreme winds because of the relatively few
studies of projected extreme winds, and shortcomings in the simulation of these events. An exception is
mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, which is likely to increase, although increases may not occur in all ocean
basins. It is likely that the global frequency of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged.
There is low confidence in projections of small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes because competing physical
processes may affect future trends and because climate models do not simulate such phenomena. There is medium
confidence that there will be a reduction in the number of mid-latitude cyclones averaged over each hemisphere due
to future anthropogenic climate change. There is low confidence in the detailed geographical projections of mid-latitude
cyclone activity. There is medium confidence in a projected poleward shift of mid-latitude storm tracks due to future
anthropogenic forcings . [3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5]
Uncertainty in projections of changes in large-scale patterns of natural climate variability remains large.
There is low confidence in projections of changes in monsoons (rainfall, circulation), because there is little consensus
in climate models regarding the sign of future change in the monsoons. Model projections of changes in El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability and the frequency of El Niño episodes as a consequence of increased greenhouse gasconcentrations are not consistent, and so there is low confidence in projections of changes in the phenomenon.
However, most models project an increase in the relative frequency of central equatorial Pacific events (which typicallyexhibit different patterns of climate variations than do the classical East Pacific events). There is low confidence in the
ability to project changes in other natural climate modes including the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Southern AnnularMode, and the Indian Ocean Dipole. [3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3]
It is very likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to upward trends in extreme coastal high water
levels in the future. There is high confidence that locations currently experiencing adverse impacts such as coastal
erosion and inundation will continue to do so in the future due to increasing sea levels, all other contributing factors
being equal. There is low confidence in wave height projections because of the small number of studies, the lack of
consistency of the wind projections between models, and limitations in the models’ ability to simulate extreme winds.
Future negative or positive changes in significant wave height are likely to reflect future changes in storminess and
associated patterns of wind change. [3.5.3, 3.5.4, 3.5.5]
Projected precipitation and temperature changes imply possible changes in floods, although overall there
is low confidence in projections of changes in fluvial floods. Confidence is low due to limited evidence and
because the causes of regional changes are complex, although there are exceptions to this statement. There is medium
confidence (based on physical reasoning) that projected increases in heavy rainfall would contribute to increases in
local flooding, in some catchments or regions. Earlier spring peak flows in snowmelt and glacier-fed rivers are very
likely . [3.5.2]
There is medium confidence that droughts will intensify in the 21st century in some seasons and areas,
due to reduced precipitation and/or increased evapotranspiration. This applies to regions including southernChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment114Europe and the Mediterranean region, central Europe, central North America, Central America and Mexico, northeast
Brazil, and southern Africa. Definitional issues, lack of observational data, and the inability of models to include all thefactors that influence droughts preclude stronger confidence than medium in the projections. Elsewhere there is overall
low confidence because of inconsistent projections of drought changes (dependent both on model and dryness index).
There is low confidence in projected future changes in dust storms although an increase could be expected where
aridity increases. [3.5.1, 3.5.8; Box 3-3; Table 3-3; Figure 3-10]
There is high confidence that changes in heat waves, glacial retreat, and/or permafrost degradation will
affect high-mountain phenomena such as slope instabilities, mass movements, and glacial lake outburstfloods. There is also high confidence that changes in heavy precipitation will affect landslides in some
regions. There is low confidence regarding future locations and timing of large rock avalanches, as these depend on
local geological conditions and other non-climatic factors. There is low confidence in projections of an anthropogenic
effect on phenomena such as shallow landslides in temperate and tropical regions, because these are stronglyinfluenced by human activities such as land use practices, deforestation, and overgrazing. [3.5.6, 3.5.7]
The small land area and often low elevation of small island states make them particularly vulnerable to
rising sea levels and impacts such as inundation, shoreline change, and saltwater intrusion intounderground aquifers. Short record lengths and the inadequate resolution of current climate models to represent
small island states limit the assessment of changes in extremes. There is insufficient evidence to assess observedtrends and future projections in rainfall across the small island regions considered here. There is medium confidence in
projected temperature increases across the Caribbean. The very likely contribution of mean sea level rise to increased
extreme coastal high water levels, coupled with the likely increase in tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, is a
specific issue for tropical small island states. [3.4.4, 3.5.3; Box 3-4]
This chapter does not provide assessments of projected changes in extremes at spatial scales smaller than
for large regions. These large-region projections provide a wider context for national or local projections,where these exist, and where they do not exist, a first indication of expected changes, their associateduncertainties, and the evidence available. [3.2.3.1]Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment1153.1. Weather and Climate Events
Related to Disasters
A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial
extent, duration, and timing of weather and climate extremes, and canresult in unprecedented extremes (Sections 3.1.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5). Aswell, weather or climate events, even if not extreme in a statistical sense,
can still lead to extreme conditions or impacts, either by crossing a critical
threshold in a social, ecological, or physical system, or by occurringsimultaneously with other events (Sections 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, 3.3, 3.4,and 3.5). Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the resultof an accumulation of weather or climate events that are, individually,not extreme themselves (though their accumulation is extreme, e.g.,Section 3.1.2). A weather system such as a tropical cyclone can have anextreme impact, depending on where and when it approaches landfall,even if the specific cyclone is not extreme relative to other tropicalcyclones. Conversely, not all extremes necessarily lead to serious impacts.Changes in extremes can also be directly related to changes in meanclimate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projectedto lie within the tails of present-day conditions (Section 3.1.6). Hence,the definition of extreme weather and climate events is complex(Section 3.1.2 and Box 3-1) and the assessment of changes in climatethat are relevant to extreme impacts and disasters needs to considerseveral aspects. Those related to vulnerability and exposure areaddressed in Chapters 2 and 4 of this report, while we focus here on thephysical dimension of these events.
Many weather and climate extremes are the result of natural climate
variability (including phenomena such as El Niño), and natural decadalor multi-decadal variations in the climate provide the backdrop foranthropogenic climate changes. Even if there were no anthropogenicchanges in climate, a wide variety of natural weather and climateextremes would still occur. 
3.1.1. Categories of Weather and Climate Events
Discussed in this Chapter
This chapter addresses changes in weather and climate events relevant
to extreme impacts and disasters grouped into the following categories:
1)Extremes of atmospheric weather and climate variables (temperature,precipitation, wind)
2)Weather and climate phenomena that influence the occurrence of
extremes in weather or climate variables or are extremes themselves(monsoons, El Niño and other modes of variability, tropical and
extratropical cyclones)
3)Impacts on the natural physical environment (droughts, floods,
extreme sea level, waves, and coastal impacts, as well as otherphysical impacts, including cryosphere-related impacts, landslides,and sand and dust storms).
The distinction between these three categories is somewhat arbitrary, and
the categories are also related. In the case of the third category, ‘impactson the natural physical environment,’ a specific distinction between
these events and those considered under ‘extremes of atmosphericweather and climate variables’ is that they are not caused by variationsin a single atmospheric weather and climate variable, but are generallythe result of specific conditions in several variables, as well as of somesurface properties or states. For instance, both floods and droughts arerelated to precipitation extremes, but are also impacted by otheratmospheric and surface conditions (and are thus often better viewed ascompound events, see Section 3.1.3). Most of the impacts on the naturalphysical environment discussed in the third category are extremesthemselves, as well as often being caused or affected by atmosphericweather or climate extremes. Another arbitrary choice made here is theseparate category for phenomena (or climate or weather systems) thatare related to weather and climate extremes, such as monsoons, El Niño,and other modes of variability. These phenomena affect the large-scaleenvironment that, in turn, influences extremes. For instance, El Niñoepisodes typically lead to droughts in some regions with, simultaneously,heavy rains and floods occurring elsewhere. This means that alloccurrences of El Niño are relevant to extremes and not only extremeEl Niño episodes. A change in the frequency or nature of El Niño episodes(or in their relationships with climate in specific regions) would affectextremes in many locations simultaneously. Similarly, changes in mon soon
patterns could affect several countries simultaneously. This is especiallyimportant from an international disaster perspective because copingwith disasters in several regions simultaneously may be challenging(see also Section 3.1.3 and Chapters 7 and 8). 
This section provides background material on the characterization and
definition of extreme events, the definition and analysis of compoundevents, the relevance of feedbacks for extremes, the approach used forthe assignment of confidence and likelihood assessments in this chapter,and the possibility of ‘surprises’ regarding future changes in extremes.Requirements and methods for analyzing changes in climate extremesare addressed in Section 3.2. Assessments regarding changes in theclimate variables, phenomena, and impacts considered in this chapterare provided in Sections 3.3 to 3.5. Table 3-1 provides summaries ofthese assessments for changes at the global scale. Tables 3-2 and 3-3(found on pages 191-202) provide more regional detail on observed andprojected changes in temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, anddryness (with regions as defined in Figure 3-1). Note that impacts onecosystems (e.g., bushfires) and human systems (e.g., urban flooding)are addressed in Chapter 4.
3.1.2. Characteristics of Weather and Climate Events
Relevant to Disasters
The identification and definition of weather and climate events that are
relevant from a risk management perspective are complex and dependon the stakeholders involved (Chapters 1 and 2). In this chapter, we focuson the assessment of changes in ‘extreme climate or weather events’(also referred to herein as ‘climate extremes’ see below and Glossary),which generally correspond to the ‘hazards’ discussed in Chapter 1.Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment116Hence, the present chapter does not directly consider the dimensions of
vulnerability or exposure, which are critical in determining the human
and ecosystem impacts of climate extremes (Chapters 1, 2, and 4).
This report defines an ‘extreme climate or weather event’ or ‘climate
extreme’ as “the occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable
above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the
range of observed values of the variable” (see Glossary). Several
aspects of this definition can be clarified thus:
•Definitions of thresholds vary, but values with less than 10, 5, 1%, or
even lower chance of occurrence for a given time of the year (day,month, season, whole year) during a specified reference period
(generally 1961-1990) are often used. In some circumstances,
information from sources other than observations, such as modelprojections, can be used as a reference.•Absolute thresholds (rather than these relative thresholds basedon the range of observed values of a variable) can also be used toidentify extreme events (e.g., specific critical temperatures forhealth impacts). 
•What is called an extreme weather or climate event will vary fromplace to place in an absolute sense (e.g., a hot day in the tropicswill be a different temperature than a hot day in the mid-latitudes),and possibly in time given some adaptation from society (seeBox 3-1). 
•Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the resultof an accumulation of moderate weather or climate events (thisaccumulation being itself extreme). Compound events (see Section3.1.3), that is, two or more events occurring simultaneously, canlead to high impacts, even if the two single events are not extremeper se (only their combination). Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
Box 3-1 | Definition and Analysis of Climate Extremes in the Scientific Literature
This box provides some details on the definition of climate extremes in the scientific literature and on common approaches empl oyed for
their investigation.
A large amount of the available scientific literature on climate extremes is based on the use of so-called ‘extreme indices,’ w hich can
either be based on the probability of occurrence of given quantities or on threshold exceedances (Section 3.1.2). Typical indic es that are
seen in the scientific literature include the number, percentage, or fraction of days with maximum temperature (Tmax) or minimu m
temperature (Tmin), below the 1st, 5th, or 10th percentile, or above the 90th, 95th, or 99th percentile, generally defined for given time
frames (days, month, season, annual) with respect to the 1961-1990 reference time period. Commonly, indices for 10th and 90thpercentiles of Tmax/Tmin computed on daily time frames are referred to as ‘cold/warm days/nights’ (e.g., Figures 3-3 and 3-4; T ables 3-1
to 3-3, and Section 3.3.1; see also Glossary). Other definitions relate to, for example, the number of days above specific abso lute
temperature or precipitation thresholds, or more complex definitions related to the length or persistence of climate extremes. Some
advantages of using predefined extreme indices are that they allow some comparability across modelling and observational studie s and
across regions (although with limitations noted below). Moreover, in the case of observations, derived indices may be easier to  obtain
than is the case with daily temperature and precipitation data, which are not always distributed by meteorological services. Pe terson and
Manton (2008) discuss collaborative international efforts to monitor extremes by employing extreme indices. Typically, although  not
exclusively, extreme indices used in the scientific literature reflect ‘moderate extremes,’ for example, events occurring as of ten as 5 or 10%
of the time. More extreme ‘extremes’ are often investigated using Extreme Value Theory (EVT) due to sampling issues (see below) .
Extreme indices are often defined for daily temperature and precipitation characteristics, and are also sometimes applied to se asonal
characteristics of these variables, to other weather and climate variables, such as wind speed, humidity, or to physical impact s and
phenomena. Beside analyses for temperature and precipitation indices (see Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2; Tables 3-2 and 3-3), other studies
are, for instance, available in the literature for wind-based (Della-Marta et al., 2009) and pressure-based (Beniston, 2009a) i ndices, for
health-relevant indices (e.g., ‘heat index’) combining temperature and relative humidity characteristics (e.g., Diffenbaugh et al., 2007;
Fischer and Schär, 2010; Sherwood and Huber, 2010), and for a range of dryness indices (see Box 3-3).
Extreme Value Theory is an approach used for the estimation of extreme values (e.g., Coles, 2001), which aims at deriving a pro bability
distribution of events from the tail of a probability distribution, that is, at the far end of the upper or lower ranges of the  probability
distributions (typically occurring less frequently than once per year or per period of interest, i.e., generally less than 1 to  5% of the
considered overall sample). EVT is used to derive a complete probability distribution for such low-probability events, which ca n also help
analyzing the probability of occurrence of events that are outside of the observed data range (with limitations). Two different  approaches
can be used to estimate the parameters for such probability distributions. In the block maximum approach , the probability distribution
parameters are estimated for maximum values of consecutive blocks of a time series (e.g., years). In the second approach, inste ad of the
block maxima the estimation is based on events that exceed a high threshold ( peaks over threshold approach). Both approaches are
used in climate research. 
Continued next page117•Not all extreme weather and climate events necessarily have
extreme impacts. 
•The distinction between extreme weather events and extreme climateevents is not precise, but is related to their specific time scales: 
–An extreme weather event is typically associated with changing
weather patterns, that is, within time frames of less than a dayto a few weeks. 
–An extreme climate event happens on longer time scales. It can
be the accumulation of several (extreme or non-extreme)
weather events (e.g., the accumulation of moderately below-
average rainy days over a season leading to substantially below-average cumulated rainfall and drought conditions).
For simplicity, we collectively refer to both extreme weather events and
extreme climate events with the term ‘climate extremes’ in this chapter.From this definition, it can be seen that climate extremes can be defined
quantitatively in two ways:
1)Related to their probability of occurrence 
2)Related to a specific (possibly impact-related) threshold.
The first type of definition can either be expressed with respect to given
percentiles of the distribution functions of the variables, or with respect
to specific return frequencies (e.g., ‘100-year event’). Compound events
can be viewed as a special category of climate extremes, which result
from the combination of two or more events, and which are again
‘extreme’ either from a statistical perspective (tails of distribution functions
of climate variables) or associated with a specific threshold (Section
3.1.3.). These two definitions of climate extremes, probability-based or
threshold-based, are not necessarily antithetic. Indeed, hazards for
society and ecosystems are often extreme both from a probability andChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
Recent publications have used other approaches for evaluating characteristics of extremes or changes in extremes, for instance,  analyzing
trends in record events or investigating whether records in observed time series are being set more or less frequently than wou ld be
expected in an unperturbed climate (Benestad, 2003, 2006; Zorita et al., 2008; Meehl et al., 2009c; Trewin and Vermont, 2010).Furthermore, besides the actual magnitude of extremes (quantified in terms of probability/return frequency or absolute threshol d), other
relevant aspects for the definition of climate extremes from an impact perspective include the event’s duration, the spatial ar ea affected,
timing, frequency, onset date, continuity (i.e., whether there are ‘breaks’ within a spell), and preconditioning (e.g., rapid t ransition from a
slowly developing meteorological drought into an agricultural drought, see Box 3-3). These aspects, together with seasonal vari ations in
climate extremes, are not as frequently examined in climate models or observational analyses, and thus can only be partly asses sed
within this chapter. 
As noted in the discussion of ‘extreme weather or climate events’ in Section 3.1.2, thresholds, percentiles, or return values u sed for the
definition of climate extremes are generally defined with respect to a given reference period (generally historical, i.e., 1961 -1990, but
possibly also based on climate model data). In some cases, a transient baseline can also be considered (i.e., the baseline uses  data from
the period under examination and changes as the period being considered changes, rather than using a standard period such as1961-1990). The choice of the reference period may be relevant for the magnitude of the assessed changes as highlighted, for ex ample,
in Lorenz et al. (2010). The choice of the reference period (static or transient) could also affect the assessment of the respe ctive role of
changes in mean versus changes in variability for changes in extremes discussed in Section 3.1.6. If extremes are based on the probability
distribution from which they are drawn, then a simple change in the mean (and keeping the same distribution) would, strictly sp eaking,
produce no relative change in extremes at all. The question of the choice of an appropriate reference period is tied to the not ion of
adaptation. Events that are considered extreme nowadays in some regions could possibly be adapted to if the vulnerability and e xposure
to these extremes is reduced (Chapters 1, 2, and 4 through 7). However, there are also some limits to adaptation as highlighted  in
Chapter 8. These considerations are difficult to include in the statistical analyses of climate scenarios because of the number  of (mostly
non-physical) aspects that would need to be taken into account.
To conclude, there is no precise definition of an extreme (e.g., D.B. Stephenson et al., 2008). In particular, we note limitati ons in the
definition of both probability-based or threshold-based climate extremes and their relations to impacts, which apply independen tly of
the chosen method of analysis: 
•An event from the extreme tails of probability distributions is not necessarily extreme in terms of impact.
•Impact-related thresholds can vary in space and time, that is, single absolute thresholds (e.g., a daily rainfall exceeding 25 mm or
the number of frost days) will not reflect extremes in all locations and time periods (e.g., season, decade).
As an illustration, projected patterns (in the magnitude but not the sign) of changes in annual heat wave length were shown to be highly
dependent on the choice of index used for the assessment of heat wave or warm spell duration (using the mean and maximum HeatWave Duration Indices, HWDImean and HWDImax, and the Warm Spell Duration Index, WSDI; see Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011),because of large geographical variations in the variability of daily temperature (Alexander et al., 2006). Similar definition i ssues apply to
other types of extremes, especially those characterizing dryness (see Section 3.5.1 and Box 3-3).118threshold perspective (e.g., a 40°C threshold for midday temperature in
the mid-latitudes).
In the scientific literature, several aspects are considered in the definition
and analysis of climate extremes (Box 3-1).
3.1.3. Compound (Multiple) Events
In climate science, compound events can be (1) two or more extremeevents occurring simultaneously or successively, (2) combinations ofextreme events with underlying conditions that amplify the impact ofthe events, or (3) combinations of events that are not themselves
extremes but lead to an extreme event or impact when combined. Thecontributing events can be of similar (clustered multiple events) or
different type(s). There are several varieties of clustered multiple events,such as tropical cyclones generated a few days apart with the samepath and/or intensities, which may occur if there is a tendency forpersistence in atmospheric circulation and genesis conditions. Examplesof compound events resulting from events of different types arevaried – for instance, high sea level coinciding with tropical cyclonelandfall (Section 3.4.4), or cold and dry conditions (e.g., the MongolianDzud, see Case Study 9.2.4), or the impact of hot events and droughtson wildfire (Case Study 9.2.2), or a combined risk of flooding from sealevel surges and precipitation-induced high river discharge (Svenssonand Jones, 2002; Van den Brink et al., 2005). Compound events can evenresult from ‘contrasting extremes’, for example, the projected occurrence
of both droughts and heavy precipitation events in future climate insome regions (Table 3-3).
Impacts on the physical environment (Section 3.5) are often the result
of compound events. For instance, floods will more likely occur oversaturated soils (Section 3.5.2), which means that both soil moisturestatus and precipitation intensity play a role. The wet soil may itself bethe result of a number of above-average but not necessarily extremeprecipitation events, or of enhanced snow melt associated withtemperature anomalies in a given season. Similarly, droughts are theresult of pre-existing soil moisture deficits and of the accumulation of
precipitation deficits and/or evapotranspiration excesses (Box 3-3), notall (or none) of which are necessarily extreme for a particular droughtevent when considered in isolation. Also, impacts on human systems orecosystems (Chapter 4) can be the results of compound events, for
example, in the case of health-related impacts associated with combined
temperature and humidity conditions (Box 3-1).
Although compound events can involve causally unrelated events, the
following causes may lead to a correlation between the occurrence of
extremes (or their impacts):
1)A common external forcing factor for changing the probability of
the two events (e.g., regional warming, change in frequency or
intensity of El Niño events)
2)Mutual reinforcement of one event by the other and vice versa due
to system feedbacks (Section 3.1.4)3)Conditional dependence of the occurrence or impact of one eventon the occurrence of another event (e.g., extreme soil moisture levelsand precipitation conditions for floods, droughts, see above).
Changes in one or more of these factors would be required for a changing
climate to induce changes in the occurrence of compound events.Unfortunately, investigation of possible changes in these factors hasreceived little attention. Also, much of the analysis of changes ofextremes has, up to now, focused on individual extremes of a singlevariable. However, recent literature in climate research is starting toconsider compound events and explore appropriate methods for theiranalysis (e.g., Coles, 2001; Beirlant et al., 2004; Benestad and Haugen,2007; Renard and Lang, 2007; Schölzel and Friederichs, 2008; Beniston,2009b; Tebaldi and Sanso, 2009; Durante and Salvadori, 2010). 
3.1.4. Feedbacks
A special case of compound events is related to the presence of feedbackswithin the climate system, that is, mutual interaction between severalclimate processes, which can either lead to a damping (negative feedback)or enhancement (positive feedback) of the initial response to a givenforcing (see also ‘climate feedback’ in the Glossary). Feedbacks can playan important role in the development of extreme events, and in somecases two (or more) climate extremes can mutually strengthen oneanother. One example of positive feedback between two extremes is thepossible mutual enhancement of droughts and heat waves in transitionalregions between dry and wet climates. This feedback has been identifiedas having an influence on projected changes in temperature variabilityand heat wave occurrence in Central and Eastern Europe and theMediterranean (Seneviratne et al., 2006a; Diffenbaugh et al., 2007), andpossibly also in Britain, Eastern North America, the Amazon, and EastAsia (Brabson et al., 2005; Clark et al., 2006). Further results also suggestthat it is a relevant factor for past heat waves and temperatureextremes in Europe and the United States (Durre et al., 2000; Fischer etal., 2007a,b; Hirschi et al., 2011). Two main mechanisms that have beensuggested to underlie this feedback are: (1) enhanced soil drying duringheat waves due to increased evapotranspiration (as a consequence ofhigher vapor pressure deficit and higher incoming radiation); and (2)higher relative heating of the air from sensible heat flux when soilmoisture deficit starts limiting evapotranspiration/latent heat flux (e.g.,Seneviratne et al., 2010). Additionally, there may also be indirect and/ornon-local effects of dryness on heat waves through, for example,changes in circulation patterns or dry air advection (e.g., Fischer et al.,2007a; Vautard et al., 2007; Haarsma et al., 2009). However, thestrength of these feedbacks is still uncertain in current climate models(e.g., Clark et al., 2010), in particular if additional feedbacks withprecipitation (e.g., Koster et al., 2004b; Seneviratne et al., 2010) andwith land use and land cover state and changes (e.g., Lobell et al., 2008;Pitman et al., 2009; Teuling et al., 2010) are considered. Also, feedbacksbetween trends in snow cover and changes in temperature extremes havebeen highlighted as being relevant for projections (e.g., Kharin et al.,2007; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011).

century climate (see also Box 3-1 for discussion of reference period).120and snow affect extremes in specific regions (hot extremes in transitional
climate regions, and cold extremes in snow-covered regions), where theymay induce significant deviations in changes in extremes versus changesin the average climate, as also discussed in Section 3.1.6. Other relevantfeedbacks involving extreme events are those that can lead to impactson the global climate, such as modification of land carbon uptake dueto enhanced drought occurrence (e.g., Ciais et al., 2005; Friedlingstein etal., 2006; Reichstein et al., 2007) or carbon release due to permafrostdegradation (see Section 3.5.7). These aspects are not, however,specifically considered in this chapter (but see Section 3.1.7, onprojections of possible increased Amazon drought and forest dieback inthis region). Chapter 4 also addresses feedback loops betweendroughts, fire, and climate change (Section 4.2.2.1).
3.1.5. Confidence and Likelihood
of Assessed Changes in Extremes
In this chapter, all assessments regarding past or projected changes in
extremes are expressed following the new IPCC Fifth Assessment Reportuncertainty guidance (Mastrandrea et al., 2010). The new uncertaintyguidance makes a clearer distinction between confidence and likelihood
(see Box SPM.2). Its use complicates comparisons between assessments
in this chapter and those in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), asthey are not directly equivalent in terms of nomenclature. The followingprocedure was adopted in this chapter (see in particular the ExecutiveSummary and Tables 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3.):
•For each assessment, the confidence level for the given assessment
is first assessed ( low, medium , or high), as discussed in the next
paragraph.
•For assessments with high confidence , likelihood assessments of a
direction of change are also provided ( virtually certain for 99-100%,
very likely for 90-100%, likely for 66-100%, more likely than not
for 50-100%, about as likely as not for 33-66%, unlikely for 0-33%,
very unlikely for 0-10%, and exceptionally unlikely for 0-1%). In
a few cases for which there is high confidence (e.g., based on
physical understanding) but for which there are not sufficientmodel projections to provide a more detailed likelihood assessment
(such as ‘ likely ’), only the confidence assessment is provided.
•For assessments with medium confidence , a direction of change is
provided, but without an assessment of likelihood.
•For assessments with low confidence , no direction of change is
generally provided.
The confidence assessments are expert-based evaluations that consider
the confidence in the tools and data basis (models, data, proxies) usedto assess or project changes in a specific element, and the associatedlevel of understanding. Examples of cases of low confidence for model
projections are if models display poor performance in simulating thespecific extreme in the present climate (see also Box 3-2), or if insufficientliterature on model performance is available for the specific extreme, forexample, due to lack of observations. Similarly for observed changes,the assessment may be of low confidence if the available evidence is
based only on scattered data (or publications) that are insufficient toprovide a robust assessment for a large region, or the observations maybe of poor quality, not homogeneous, or only of an indirect nature(proxies). In cases with low confidence regarding past or projected
changes in some extremes, we indicate whether the low confidence is
due to lack of literature, lack of evidence (data, observations), or lack ofunderstanding. It should be noted that there are some overlapsbetween these categories, as for instance a lack of evidence can be atthe root of a lack of literature and understanding. Cases of changes inextremes for which confidence in the models and data is rated as‘medium ’ are those where we have some confidence in the tools and
evidence available to us, but there remain substantial doubts aboutsome aspects of the quality of these tools. It should be noted that anassessment of low confidence in observed or projected changes or
trends in a specific extreme neither implies nor excludes the possibilityof changes in this extreme. Rather the assessment indicates low
confidence in the ability to detect or project any such changes.
Changes (observed or projected) in some extremes are easier to assess
than in others either due to the complexity of the underlying processesor to the amount of evidence available for their understanding. ThisChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment

Notes: 1. Due to trends in stratospheric ozone concentrations.Table 3-1 (continued)121results in differing levels of uncertainty in climate simulations and
projections for different extremes (Box 3-2). Because of these issues,projections in some extremes are difficult or even impossible to provide,although projections in some other extremes have a high level ofconfidence. In addition, uncertainty in projections also varies over differenttime frames for individual extremes, because of varying contributionsover time of internal climate variability, model uncertainty, and emissionscenario uncertainty to the overall uncertainty (Box 3-2 and Section 3.2).Overall, we can infer that our confidence in past and future changes inextremes varies with the type of extreme, the data available, and theregion, season, and time frame being considered, linked with the levelof understanding and reliability of simulation of the underlying physicalprocesses. These various aspects are addressed in more detail in Box 3-2,Section 3.2, and the subsections on specific extremes in Sections 3.3-3.5.
3.1.6. Changes in Extremes and Their Relationship
to Changes in Regional and Global Mean Climate
Changes in extremes can be linked to changes in the mean, variance, or
shape of probability distributions, or all of these (see, e.g., Figure 1-2).Thus a change in the frequency of occurrence of hot days (i.e., daysabove a certain threshold) can arise from a change in the mean dailymaximum temperature, and/or from a change in the variance and/orshape of the frequency distribution of daily maximum temperatures. Ifchanges in the frequency of occurrence of hot days were mainly linkedto changes in the mean daily maximum temperature, and changes in theshape and variability of the distribution of daily maximum temperatureswere of secondary importance, then it might be reasonable to useprojected changes in mean temperature to estimate how changes inextreme temperatures might change in the future. If, however, changes inthe shape and variability of the frequency distribution of daily maximumtemperature were important, such naive extrapolation would be lessappropriate or possibly even misleading (e.g., Ballester et al., 2010). Theresults of both empirical and model studies indicate that although inseveral situations changes in extremes do scale closely with changes inthe mean (e.g., Griffiths et al., 2005), there are sufficient exceptions fromthis that changes in the variability and shape of probability distributions
of weather and climate variables need to be considered as well as
changes in means, if we are to project future changes in extremes (e.g.,Hegerl et al., 2004; Schär et al., 2004; Caesar et al., 2006; Clark et al.,2006; Della-Marta et al., 2007a; Kharin et al., 2007; Brown et al., 2008;Ballester et al., 2010; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). This appears to beespecially the case for short-duration precipitation, and for temperaturesin mid- and high latitudes (but not all locations in these regions). In mid-
and high latitudes stronger increases (or decreases) in some extremesare generally associated with feedbacks with soil moisture or snow
cover (Section 3.1.4). Note that the respective importance of changes in
mean versus changes in variability also depends on the choice of the
reference period used to define the extremes (Box 3-1).
An additional relevant question is the extent to which regional changes
in extremes scale with changes in global mean climate. Indeed, recentpublications and the public debate have focused, for example, on global
mean temperature targets (e.g., Allen et al., 2009; Meinshausen et al.,2009), however, the exact implications of these mean global changes(e.g., ‘2°C target’) for regional extremes have not been widely assessed(e.g., Clark et al., 2010). Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011) investigatedthe scaling between projected changes in the 10th and 90th percentileof Tmax on annual and seasonal (June-July-August: JJA, December-January-February: DJF) time scales with globally averaged annual meanchanges in Tmax based on the whole CMIP3 ensemble (see Section 3.2.3for discussion of the CMIP3 ensemble). The results highlight particularlylarge projected changes in the 10th percentile Tmax in the northernhigh-latitude regions in winter and the 90th percentile Tmax inSouthern Europe in summer with scaling factors of about 2 in bothcases (i.e., increases of about 4°C for a mean global increase of 2°C).However, in some regions and seasons, the scaling can also be below 1(e.g., changes in 10th percentile in JJA in the high latitudes). This is alsoillustrated in Figure 3-5a, which compares analyses of changes in returnvalues of annual extremes of maximum daily temperatures for the overallland and specific regions, and shows high region-to-region variability inthese changes. The changes in return values at the global scale (‘Globe(Land only)’) for their part are almost identical to the changes in globalmean daily maximum temperature, suggesting that the scaling issues arerelated to regional effects rather than overall differences in the changesin the tails versus the means of the distributions of daily maximumtemperature. The situation is very different for precipitation (Figure 3-7a),with clearly distinct behavior between changes in mean and extremeprecipitation at the global scale, highlighting the dependency of anyscaling on the variable being considered. The lack of consistent scalingbetween regional and seasonal changes in extremes and changes inmeans has also been highlighted in empirical studies (e.g., Caesar et al.,2006). It should further be noted that not only do regional extremes notnecessarily scale with global mean changes, but also mean globalwarming does not exclude the possibility of cooling in some regions andseasons, both in the recent past and in the coming decades: it has forinstance been recently suggested that the decrease in sea ice caused bythe mean warming could induce, although not systematically, morefrequent cold winter extremes over northern continents (Petoukhov andSemenov, 2010). Also parts of central North America and the easternUnited States present cooling trends in mean temperature and sometemperature extremes in the spring to summer season in recent decades(Section 3.3.1). It should be noted that, independently of scaling issuesfor the means and extremes of the same variable, some extremes canbe related to mean climate changes in other variables, such as linksbetween mean global changes in relative humidity and some regionalchanges in heavy precipitation events (Sections 3.2.2.1 and 3.3.2).
Global-scale trends in a specific extreme may be either more reliable or less
reliable than some regional-scale trends, depending on the geographicaluniformity of the trends in the specific extreme. In particular, climateprojections for some variables are not consistent, even in the sign of theprojected change, everywhere across the globe (e.g., Christensen et al.,2007; Meehl et al., 2007b). For instance, projections typically includesome regions with a tendency toward wetter conditions and others with
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment122a tendency toward drier conditions, with some regions displaying a shift
in climate regimes (e.g., from humid to transitional or transitional to dry).Some of these regional changes will depend on how forcing changes mayalter the regional atmospheric circulation, especially in coastal regionsand regions with substantial orography. Hence for certain extremes suchas floods and droughts, regional projections might indicate larger
changes than is the case for projections of global averages (whichwould average the regional signals exhibiting changes of oppositesigns). This also means that signals at the regional scale may be morereliable (and meaningful) in some cases than assessments at the globalscale. On the other hand, temperature extremes projections, which areconsistent across most regions, are thus more reliable at the globalscale (‘ virtually certain ’) than at the regional scale (at most ‘ very likely ’).
3.1.7. Surprises / Abrupt Climate Change
This report focuses on the most probable changes in extremes based on
current knowledge. However, the possible future occurrence of low-probability, high-impact scenarios associated with the crossing of poorlyunderstood climate thresholds cannot be excluded, given the transientand complex nature of the climate system. Such scenarios have importantimplications for society as highlighted in Section 8.5.1. So, an assessmentthat we have low confidence in projections of a specific extreme, or even
lack of consideration of given climate changes under the categoriescovered in this chapter (e.g., shutdown of the meridional overturningcirculation), should not be interpreted as meaning that no change isexpected in this extreme or climate element (see also Section 3.1.5).Feedbacks play an important role in either damping or enhancingextremes in several climate variables (Section 3.1.4), and this can alsolead to ‘surprises,’ that is, changes in extremes greater (or less) thanmight be expected with a gradual warming of the climate system.Similarly, as discussed in 3.1.3, contrasting or multiple extremes canoccur but our understanding of these is insufficient to provide crediblecomprehensive projections of risks associated with such combinations. 
One aspect that we do not address in this chapter is the existence of
possible tipping points in the climate system (e.g., Meehl et al., 2007b;Lenton et al., 2008; Scheffer et al., 2009), that is, the risks of abrupt,possibly irreversible changes in the climate system. Abrupt climate
change is defined as follows in the Glossary: “The nonlinearity of the
climate system may lead to abrupt climate change, sometimes called
rapid climate change, abrupt events, or even surprises. The term abrupt
often refers to time scales faster than the typical time scale of the
responsible forcing. However, not all abrupt climate changes need beexternally forced. Some changes may be truly unexpected, resulting
from a strong, rapidly changing forcing of a nonlinear system.”
Thresholds associated with tipping points may be termed ‘criticalthresholds,’ or, in the case of the climate system, ‘climate thresholds’.
Scheffer et al. (2009) illustrate the possible equilibrium responses of a
system to forcing. In the case of a linear response, only a large forcingcan lead to a major state change in the system. However, in the presence
of a critical threshold even a small change in forcing can lead to a similarmajor change in the system. For systems with critical bifurcations in the
equilibrium state function two alternative stable conditions may exist,whereby an induced change may be irreversible. Such critical transitionswithin the climate system represent typical low-probability, high-impactscenarios, which were also noted in the AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007b).Lenton et al. (2008) provided a recent review on potential tipping elementswithin the climate system, that is, subsystems of the Earth system thatare at least subcontinental in scale and which may entail a tippingpoint. Some of these would be especially relevant to certain extremes[e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian summer monsoon,and the Sahara/Sahel and West African monsoon for drought and heavyprecipitation, and the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets for sealevel extremes], or are induced by changes in extremes (e.g., Amazonrainforest die-back induced by drought). For some of the identifiedtipping elements, the existence of bistability has been suggested bypaleoclimate records, but is still debated in some cases (e.g., Brovkin etal., 2009). There is often a lack of agreement between models regardingthese low-probability, high-impact scenarios, for instance, regarding apossible increased drought and consequent die-back of the Amazonrainforest (e.g., Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Poulter et al., 2010; seeTable 3-3 for dryness projections in this region), the risk of an actualshutdown of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (e.g., Rahmstorf etal., 2005; Lenton et al., 2008), or the potential irreversibility of thedecrease in Arctic sea ice (Tietsche et al., 2011). For this reason,confidence in these scenarios is assessed as low.
3.2. Requirements and Methods
for Analyzing Changes in Extremes
3.2.1. Observed Changes
Sections 3.3 to 3.5 of this chapter provide assessments of the literature
regarding changes in extremes in the observed record published mainlysince the AR4 and building on the AR4 assessment. Summaries of theseassessments are provided in Table 3-1. Overviews of observed regionalchanges in temperature and precipitation extremes are provided inTable 3-2. In this section issues are discussed related to the data andobservations used to examine observed changes in extremes. 
Issues with data availability are especially critical when examining
changes in extremes of given climate variables (Nicholls, 1995). Indeed,the more rare the event, the more difficult it is to identify long-termchanges, simply because there are fewer cases to evaluate (Frei andSchär, 2001; Klein Tank and Können, 2003). Identification of changes inextremes is also dependent on the analysis technique employed (X.Zhang et al., 2004; Trömel and Schönwiese, 2005). Another importantcriterion constraining data availability for the analysis of extremes is therespective time scale on which they occur (Section 3.1.2), since thisdetermines the required temporal resolution for their assessment (e.g.,heavy hourly or daily precipitation versus multi-year drought). Longertime resolution data (e.g., monthly, seasonal, and annual values) fortemperature and precipitation are available for most parts of the worldChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment123starting late in the 19th to early 20th century, and allow analysis of
meteorological drought (see Box 3-3) and unusually wet periods of theorder of a month or longer. To examine changes in extremes occurring onshort time scales, particularly of climate variables such as temperatureand precipitation (or wind), normally requires the use of high-temporalresolution data, such as daily or sub-daily observations, which aregenerally either not available, or available only since the middle of the20th century and in many regions only from as recently as 1970. Evenwhere sufficient data are available, several problems can still limit theiranalysis. First, although the situation is changing (especially for thesituation with respect to ‘extreme indices,’ Box 3-1), many countries stilldo not freely distribute their higher temporal resolution data. Second,there can be issues with the quality of measurements. A third importantissue is climate data homogeneity (see below). These and other issuesare discussed in detail in the AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007). For instance,the temperature and precipitation stations considered in the daily dataset used in Alexander et al. (2006) are not globally uniform. Althoughobservations for most parts of the globe are available, measurementsare lacking in Northern South America, Africa, and part of Australia. Theother data set commonly used for extremes analyses is from Caesar et al.(2006; used, e.g., in Brown et al., 2008), which also has data gaps inmost of South America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Mexico, the Middle East,India, and Southeast Asia. Also the study by Vose et al. (2005) has datagaps in South America, Africa, and India. It should be further notedthat the regions with data coverage do not all have the same density ofstations (Alexander et al., 2006; Caesar et al., 2006). While some studiesare available on a country or regional basis for areas not covered inglobal studies (see, e.g., Tables 3-2 and 3-3), lack of data in many partsof the globe leads to limitations in our ability to assess observedchanges in climate extremes for many regions.
Whether or not climate data are homogeneous is of clear relevance for
an analysis of extremes, especially at smaller spatial scales. Data aredefined as homogeneous when the variations and trends in a climate timeseries are due solely to variability and changes in the climate system. Some
meteorological elements are especially vulnerable to uncertainties causedby even small changes in the exposure of the measuring equipment. Forinstance, erection of a small building or changes in vegetative cover nearthe measuring equipment can produce a bias in wind measurements
(Wan et al., 2010). When a change occurs it can result in either adiscontinuity in the time series (step change) or a more gradual changethat can manifest itself as a false trend (Menne and Williams Jr., 2009),both of which can impact on whether a particular observation exceedsa threshold. Homogeneity detection and data adjustments have beenimplemented for longer averaging periods (e.g., monthly, seasonal,annual); however, techniques applicable to shorter observing periods(e.g., daily) data have only recently been developed (e.g., Vincent etal., 2002; Della-Marta and Wanner, 2006), and have not been widelyimplemented. Homogeneity issues also affect the monitoring of othermeteorological and climate variables, for which further and more severelimitations also can exist. This is in particular the case regardingmeasurements of wind and relative humidity, and data required for theanalysis of weather and climate phenomena (tornadoes, extratropicaland tropical cyclones; Sections 3.3.3, 3.4.4, and 3.4.5), as well asimpacts on the physical environment (e.g., droughts, floods, cryosphereimpacts; Section 3.5). 
Thunderstorms, tornadoes, and related phenomena are not well
observed in many parts of the world. Tornado occurrence since 1950 inthe United States, for instance, displays an increasing trend that mainlyreflects increased population density and increased numbers of peoplein remote areas (Trenberth et al., 2007; Kunkel et al., 2008). Such trendsincrease the likelihood that a tornado would be observed. A similarproblem occurs with thunderstorms. Changes in reporting practices,increased population density, and even changes in the ambient noiselevel at an observing station all have led to inconsistencies in theobserved record of thunderstorms. 
Studies examining changes in extratropical cyclones, which focus on
changes in storm track location, intensities, and frequency, are limitedin time due to a lack of suitable data prior to about 1950. Most of thesestudies have relied on model-based reanalyses that also incorporateobservations into a hybrid model-observational data set. However,reanalyses can have homogeneity problems due to changes in theamount and type of data being assimilated, such as the introduction ofsatellite data in the late 1970s and other observing system changes(Trenberth et al., 2001; Bengtsson et al., 2004). Recent reanalysis effortshave attempted to produce more homogeneous reanalyses that showpromise for examining changes in extratropical cyclones and other cli mate
features (Compo et al., 2006). Results, however, are strongly dependenton the reanalysis and cyclone tracking techniques used (Ulbrich et al.,2009).
The robustness of analyses of observed changes in tropical cyclones has
been hampered by a number of issues with the historical record. One ofthe major issues is the heterogeneity introduced by changing technologyand reporting protocols within the responsible agencies (e.g., Landseaet al., 2004). Further heterogeneity is introduced when records frommultiple ocean basins are combined to explore global trends, because dataquality and reporting protocols vary substantially between agencies (Knappand Kruk, 2010). Much like other weather and climate observations,

Exact coordinates of the regions are provided in the on-line supplement, Appendix 3.A.
Assessments and analyses are provided for land areas only.124tropical cyclone observations are taken to support short-term forecasting
needs. Improvements in observing techniques are often implementedwithout any overlap or calibration against existing methods to documentthe impact of the changes on the climate record. Additionally, advancesin technology have enabled better and more complete observations. Forexample, the introduction of aircraft reconnaissance in some basins in
the 1940s and satellite data in the 1960s had a profound effect on ourability to accurately identify and measure tropical cyclones, particularly
those that never encountered land or a ship. While aircraft reconnaissanceprograms have continued in the North Atlantic, they were terminated inthe Western Pacific in 1987. The introduction of geostationary satellite
imagery in the 1970s, and the introduction (and subsequent improvement)
of new tropical cyclone analysis methods (such as the Dvorak technique
for estimating storm intensity), further compromises the homogeneity
of historical records of tropical cyclone activity.
Regarding impacts to the physical environment, soil moisture is a key
variable for which data sets are extremely scarce (e.g., Robock et al.,
2000; Seneviratne et al., 2010). This represents a critical issue for the
validation and correct representation of soil moisture (agricultural) as
well as hydrological drought (Box 3-3) in climate, land surface, andhydrological models, and the monitoring of ongoing changes in regional
terrestrial water storage. As a consequence, these need to be inferredfrom simple climate indices or model-based approaches (Box 3-3). Suchestimates rely in large part on precipitation observations, which have,however, inadequate spatial coverage for these applications in manyregions of the world (e.g., Oki et al., 1999; Fekete et al., 2004; Koster etal., 2004a). Similarly, runoff observations are not globally available,which results in significant uncertainties in the closing of the global andsome regional water budgets (Legates et al., 2005; Peel and McMahon,2006; Dai et al., 2009; Teuling et al., 2009), as well as for the globalanalysis of changes in the occurrence of floods (Section 3.5.2).Additionally, ground observations of snow, which are lacking in severalregions, are important for the investigation of physical impacts,particularly those related to the cryosphere and runoff generation (e.g.,Essery et al., 2009; Rott et al., 2010).
All of the above-mentioned issues lead to uncertainties in observed
trends in extremes. In many instances, great care has been taken todevelop procedures to reduce the confounding influences of theseissues on the data, which in turn helps to reduce uncertainty, andprogress has been made in the last 15 years (e.g., Caesar et al., 2006;Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
FAQ 3.1 | Is the Climate Becoming More Extreme?
While there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gases have likely caused changes in some types of extremes ,there is no simple
answer to the question of whether the climate ,in general ,has become more or less extreme. Both the terms ‘more extreme’ and ‘less
extreme’ can be defined in different ways ,resulting in different characterizations of observed changes in extremes. Additionally ,from a
physical climate science perspective it is difficult to devise a comprehensive metric that encompasses all aspects of extreme b ehavior in
the climate. 
One approach for evaluating whether the climate is becoming more extreme would be to determine whether there have been changes
in the typical range of variation of specific climate variables. For example, if there was evidence that temperature variations  in a given
region had become significantly larger than in the past, then it would be reasonable to conclude that temperatures in that regi on had
become more extreme. More simply, temperature variations might be considered to be becoming more extreme if the differencebetween the highest and the lowest temperature observed in a year is increasing. According to this approach, daily temperature over
the globe may have become less extreme because there have generally been greater increases in mean daily minimum temperaturesglobally than in mean daily maximum temperatures, over the second half of the 20th century. On the other hand, one might conclu de
that daily precipitation has become more extreme because observations suggest that the magnitude of the heaviest precipitation events
has increased in many parts of the world. Another approach would be to ask whether there have been significant changes in thefrequency with which climate variables cross fixed thresholds that have been associated with human or other impacts. For exampl e, an
increase in the mean temperature usually results in an increase in hot extremes and a decrease in cold extremes. Such a shift i n the
temperature distribution would not increase the ‘extremeness’ of day-to-day variations in temperature, but would be perceived a s
resulting in a more extreme warm temperature climate, and a less extreme cold temperature climate. So the answer to the questio n
posed here would depend on the variable of interest, and on which specific measure of the extremeness of that variable is exami ned. As
well, to provide a complete answer to the above question, one would also have to collate not just trends in single variables, b ut also
indicators of change in complex extreme events resulting from a sequence of individual events, or the simultaneous occurrence o f
different types of extremes. So it would be difficult to comprehensively describe the full suite of phenomena of concern, or to  find a way
to synthesize all such indicators into a single extremeness metric that could be used to comprehensively assess whether the cli mate as a
whole has become more extreme from a physical perspective. And to make such a metric useful to more than a specific location, o ne
would have to combine the results at many locations, each with a different perspective on what is ‘extreme.’
Continued next page125Brown et al., 2008). As a consequence, more complete and homogenous
information about changes is now available for at least some variablesand regions (Nicholls and Alexander, 2007; Peterson and Manton,2008). For instance, the development of global databases of dailytemperature and precipitation covering up to 70% of the global landarea has allowed robust analyses of extremes (see Alexander et al.,
2006). In addition, analyses of temperature and precipitation extremes
using higher temporal resolution data, such as that available in the
Global Historical Climatology Network – Daily data set (Durre et al., 2008)have also proven robust at both a global (Alexander et al., 2006) and
regional scale (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). Nonetheless, as highlighted
above, for many extremes, data remain sparse and problematic, resulting
in lower ability to establish changes, particularly on a global basis andfor specific regions. 
3.2.2. The Causes behind the Changes
This section discusses the main requirements, approaches, andconsiderations for the attribution of causes for observed changes in
extremes. In Sections 3.3 to 3.5, the causes of observed changes inspecific extremes are assessed. A global summary of these assessments
is provided in Table 3-1. Climate variations and change are induced byvariability internal to the climate system, and changes in externalforcings, which include natural external forcings such as changes in solarirradiance and volcanism, and anthropogenic forcings such as aerosoland greenhouse gas emissions principally due to the burning of fossilfuels, and land use and land cover changes. The mean state, extremes,and variability are all related aspects of the climate, so external forcingsthat affect the mean climate would in general result in changes inextremes. For this reason, we provide in Section 3.2.2.1 a brief overviewof human-induced changes in the mean climate to aid the understandingof changes in extremes as the literature directly addressing the causesof changes in extremes is quite limited. 
3.2.2.1. Human-Induced Changes in the Mean Climate
that Affect Extremes
The occurrence of extremes is usually the result of multiple factors,
which can act either on the large scale or on the regional (and local)scale (see also Section 3.1.6). Some relevant large-scale impacts ofChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
Three types of metrics have been considered to avoid these problems, and thereby allow an answer to this question. One approach  is to
count the number of record-breaking events in a variable and to examine such a count for any trend. However, one would still fa ce the
problem of what to do if, for instance, hot extremes are setting new records, while cold extremes are not occurring as frequent ly as in
the past. In such a case, counting the number of records might not indicate whether the climate was becoming more or less extre me,
rather just whether there was a shift in the mean climate. Also, the question of how to combine the numbers of record-breaking events
in various extremes (e.g., daily precipitation and hot temperatures) would need to be considered. Another approach is to combin e
indicators of a selection of important extremes into a single index, such as the Climate Extremes Index (CEI), which measures t he fraction
of the area of a region or country experiencing extremes in monthly mean surface temperature, daily precipitation, and drought.  The CEI,
however, omits many important extremes such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes, and could, therefore, not be considered a compl ete
index of ‘extremeness.’ Nor does it take into account complex or multiple extremes, nor the varying thresholds that relate extr emes to
impacts in various sectors. 
A third approach to solving this dilemma arises from the fact that extremes often have deleterious economic consequences. It ma y
therefore be possible to measure the integrated economic effects of the occurrence of different types of extremes into a commoninstrument such as insurance payout to determine if there has been an increase or decrease in that instrument. This approach wo uld
have the value that it clearly takes into account those extremes with economic consequences. But trends in such an instrument w ill be
dominated by changes in vulnerability and exposure and it will be difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle changes in the i nstrument
caused by non-climatic changes in vulnerability or exposure in order to leave a residual that reflects only changes in climate extremes.
For example, coastal development can increase the exposure of populations to hurricanes; therefore, an increase in damage in co astal
regions caused by hurricane landfalls will largely reflect changes in exposure and may not be indicative of increased hurricane  activity.
Moreover, it may not always be possible to associate impacts such as the loss of human life or damage to an ecosystem due to cl imate
extremes to a measurable instrument. 
None of the above instruments has yet been developed sufficiently as to allow us to confidently answer the question posed here.  Thus
we are restricted to questions about whether specific extremes are becoming more or less common, and our confidence in the answ ers
to such questions, including the direction and magnitude of changes in specific extremes, depends on the type of extreme, as we ll as
on the region and season, linked with the level of understanding of the underlying processes and the reliability of their simul ation in
models. 126external forcings affecting extremes include net increases in temperature
induced by changes in radiation, enhanced moisture content of theatmosphere, and increased land-sea contrast in temperatures, which can,for example, affect circulation patterns and to some extent monsoons.At regional and local scales, additional processes can modulate theoverall changes in extremes, including regional feedbacks, in particularlinked to land-atmosphere interactions with, for example, soil moistureor snow (e.g., Section 3.1.4). This section briefly reviews the currentunderstanding of the causes (i.e., in the sense of attribution to eitherexternal forcing or internal climate variability) of large-scale (and someregional) changes in the mean climate that are of relevance to extremeevents, to the extent that they have been considered in detection andattribution studies.
Regarding observed increases in global average annual mean surface
temperatures in the second half of the 20th century, we base our analysison the following AR4 assessment (Hegerl et al., 2007): Most of theobserved increase in global average temperatures is very likely due to
the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.Greenhouse gas forcing alone would likely have resulted in a greater
warming than observed if there had not been an offsetting coolingeffect from aerosol and other forcings. It is extremely unlikely (<5%)
that the global pattern of warming can be explained without externalforcing, and very unlikely that it is due to known natural external causes
alone. Anthropogenically forced warming over the second half of the20th century has also been detected in ocean heat content and airtemperatures in all continents (Hegerl et al., 2007; Gillett et al., 2008b). 
Hegerl et al. (2007) assessed literature that considered detection in
temperature trends at scales as small as approximately 500 km. Recentwork has provided more evidence of detection of an anthropogenicinfluence at increasingly smaller spatial scales and for seasonal averages(Stott et al., 2010). For instance, Min and Hense (2007) found thatestimates of response to anthropogenic forcing from the multi-modelCoupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) ensemble (seeSection 3.2.3.3) provided a better explanation for observed continental-scale seasonal temperature changes than alternative explanations suchas natural external forcing or internal variability. In another study, ananthropogenic signal was detected in 20th-century summer temperaturesin Northern Hemisphere subcontinental regions except central North
America, although the results were more uncertain when anthropogenic
and natural signals were considered together (Jones et al., 2008). Ananthropogenic signal has also been detected in multi-decadal trends
in a US climate extreme index (Burkholder and Karoly, 2007), in the
hydrological cycle of the western United States (Barnett et al., 2008), inNew Zealand temperatures (Dean and Stott, 2009), and in Europeantemperatures (Christidis et al., 2011a).
Attribution has more stringent demands than those for the detection of
an external influence in observations. Overall, attribution at scales
smaller than continental has still not yet been established primarily due
to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the difficulties of separatelyattributing effects of the wider range of possible driving processes(either attributable to external forcing or internal climate variability) at
these scales (Hegerl et al., 2007). One reason is that averaging oversmaller regions reduces the internal variability less than does averagingover large regions. In addition, the small-scale details of external forcing,and the responses simulated by models, are less credible than large-scale features. For instance, temperature changes are poorly simulatedby models in some regions and seasons (Dean and Stott, 2009; vanOldenborgh et al., 2009). Also the inclusion of additional forcing factors,such as land use change and aerosols that can be more important atregional scales, remains a challenge (Lohmann and Feichter, 2007;Pitman et al., 2009; Rotstayn et al., 2009). 
One of the significant advances since AR4 is emerging evidence of human
influence on global atmospheric moisture content and precipitation.According to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, the saturation vaporpressure increases approximately exponentially with temperature. It isphysically plausible that relative humidity would remain roughly constantunder climate change (e.g., Hegerl et al., 2007). This means that specifichumidity increases about 7% for a one degree increase in temperaturein the current climate. Indeed, observations indicate significant increasesbetween 1973 and 2003 in global surface specific humidity but not inrelative humidity (Willett et al., 2008), and at the largest spatial-temporalscales moistening is close to the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of thesaturated specific humidity (~7% K
-1; Willett et al., 2010), though relative
humidity over low- and mid-latitude land areas decreased over a 10-yearperiod prior to 2008 possibly due to a slower temperature increase inthe oceans than over the land (Simmons et al., 2010). By comparingobservations with model simulations, changes in the global surfacespecific humidity for 1973-2003 (Willett et al., 2007), and in lowertropospheric moisture content over the 1988-2006 period (Santer et al.,2007) can be attributed to anthropogenic influence. 
The increase in the atmospheric moisture content would be expected to
lead to an increase in extreme precipitation when other factors do notchange. Min et al. (2011) detected an anthropogenic influence in annualmaxima of daily precipitation over Northern Hemisphere land areas. Theinfluence of anthropogenic forcing has been detected in the latitudinalpattern of land precipitation trends though the model-simulatedmagnitude of changes is smaller than that observed (X. Zhang et al., 2007).The smaller changes in model simulations may be due in part to averagingprecipitation trends from different model simulations, as spatial patternsof trends simulated by different models are not exactly the same. Theinfluence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols on changesin precipitation over high-latitude land areas north of 55°N has also beendetected (Min et al., 2008). Detection is possible there, despite limiteddata coverage, in part because the response to forcing is relatively strong,and because internal variability in precipitation is low in this region. 
3.2.2.2. How to Attribute a Change in Extremes to Causes
The good practice guidance paper on detection and attribution (Hegerlet al., 2010) reconciles terminologies of detection and attribution usedChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment127by Working Groups I and II in the AR4. It provides detailed guidance on
the procedures that include two main approaches to attribute a change
in climate to causes. One is single-step attribution, which involvesassessments that attribute an observed change within a system to an
external forcing based on explicitly modelling the response of thevariable to the external forcings. The alternate procedure is multi-step
attribution, which combines an assessment that attributes an observedchange in a variable of interest to a change in climate, with a separateassessment that attributes the change to external forcings. Attributionof changes in climate extremes has some unique issues. Observed dataChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
FAQ 3.2 | Has Climate Change Affected Individual Extreme Events?
A changing climate can be expected to lead to changes in climate and weather extremes. But it is challenging to associate a sin gle
extreme event with a specific cause such as increasing greenhouse gases because a wide range of extreme events could occur even  in
an unchanging climate ,and because extreme events are usually caused by a combination of factors. Despite this ,it may be possible to
make an attribution statement about a specific weather event by attributing the changed probability of its occurrence to a part icular
cause. For example ,it has been estimated that human influences have more than doubled the probability of a very hot European summer
like that of 2003. 
Recent years have seen many extreme events including the extremely hot summer in parts of Europe in 2003 and 2010, and the inte nse
North Atlantic hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005. Can the increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases be consider ed
the ‘cause’ of such extreme events? That is, could we say these events would nothave occurred if CO2had remained at pre-industrial
concentrations? For instance, the monthly mean November temperature averaged across the state of New South Wales in Australia f or
November 2009 is about 3.5 standard deviations warmer than the 1950-2008 mean, suggesting that the chance of such a temperatureoccurring in the 1950-2008 climate (assuming a stationary climate) is quite low. Is this event, therefore, an indication of a c hanging
climate? In the CRUTEM3V global land surface temperature data set, about one in every 900 monthly mean temperatures observedbetween 1900 and 1949 lies more than 3.5 standard deviations above the corresponding monthly mean temperature for 1950-2008.
1
Since global temperature was lower in the first half of the 20th century, this clearly indicates that an extreme warm event as rare as the
November 2009 temperature in any specific location could have occurred in the past, even if its occurrence in recent times is m ore probable. 
A second complicating issue is that extreme events usually result from a combination of factors, and this will make it difficul t to attribute
an extreme to a single causal factor. The hot 2003 European summer was associated with a persistent high-pressure system (which  led
to clear skies and thus more solar energy received at the surface) and too-dry soil (which meant that less solar energy was use d for
evaporation, leaving more energy to heat the soil). Another example is that hurricane genesis requires weak vertical wind shear , as well
as very warm sea surface temperatures. Since some factors, but not others, may be affected by a specific cause such as increasi ng
greenhouse gas concentrations, it is difficult to separate the human influence on a single, specific extreme event from other f actors
influencing the extreme. 
Nevertheless, climate models can sometimes be used to identify if specific factors are changing the likelihood of the occurrenc e of
extreme events. In the case of the 2003 European heat wave, a model experiment indicated that human influences more than double d
the likelihood of having a summer in Europe as hot as that of 2003, as discussed in the AR4. The value of such a probability-ba sed
approach – “Does human influence change the likelihood of an event?” – is that it can be used to estimate the influence of exte rnal
factors, such as increases in greenhouse gases, on the frequency of specific types of events, such as heat waves or cold extrem es. The
same likelihood-based approach has been used to examine anthropogenic greenhouse gas contribution to flood probability.
The discussion above relates to an individual, specific occurrence of an extreme event (e.g., a single heat wave). For the reas ons outlined
above it remains very difficult to attribute any individual event to greenhouse gas-induced warming (even if physical reasoning  or model
experiments suggest such an extreme may be more likely in a changed climate). On the other hand, a long-term trend in an extrem e
(e.g., heat wave occurrences) is a different matter. It is certainly feasible to test whether such a trend is likely to have re sulted from
anthropogenic influences on the climate, just as a global warming trend can be assessed to determine its likely cause.
____________
1We used the CRUTEM3V land surface temperature data. We limit our calculation to grid points with long-term observations, requir ing at least 50 non-missing values
during 1950-2008 for a calendar month and a grid point to be included. A standard deviation is computed for the period 1950-200 8. We then count the number of
occurrences when the temperature anomaly during 1900-1949 relative to 1950-2008 mean is greater than 3.5 standard deviations, a nd compare it with the total
number of observations for the grid and month in that period. The ratio of these two numbers is 0.00107.128are limited in both quantity and quality (Section 3.2.1), resulting in
uncertainty in the estimation of past changes; the signal-to-noise ratiomay be low for many variables and insufficient data may be available todetect such weak signals. In addition, global climate models (GCMs)have several issues in simulating extremes and downscaling techniquescan only partly circumvent these issues (Section 3.2.3).
Single-step attribution based on optimal detection and attribution (e.g.,
Hegerl et al., 2007) can in principle be applied to climate extremes.However, the difference in statistical properties between mean valuesand extremes needs to be carefully addressed (e.g., Zwiers et al., 2011;see also Section 3.1.6). Post-processing of climate model simulations toderive a quantity of interest that is not explicitly simulated by the models,by applying empirical methods or physically based models to the outputsfrom the climate models, may make it possible to directly compareobserved extremes with climate model results. For example, sea levelpressure simulated by multiple GCMs has been used to derivegeostrophic wind to represent atmospheric storminess and to derivesignificant wave height on the oceans for the detection of externalinfluence on trends in atmospheric storminess and northern oceanswave heights (X.L. Wang et al., 2009a). GCM-simulated precipitationand temperature have also been downscaled as input to hydrologicaland snowpack models to infer past and future changes in temperature,timing of the peak flow, and snow water equivalent for the westernUnited States, and this enabled a detection and attribution analysis ofhuman-induced changes in these variables (Barnett et al., 2008). 
If a single-step attribution of causes to effects on extremes or physical
impacts of extremes is not feasible, it might be feasible to conduct amultiple-step attribution. The assessment would then need to be basedon evidence not directly derived from model simulations, that is, physicalunderstanding and expert judgment, or their combination. For instance,in the northern high-latitude regions, spring temperature has increased,and the timing of spring peak flows in snowmelt-fed rivers has shiftedtoward earlier dates (Regonda et al., 2005; Knowles et al., 2006). Achange in streamflow may be attributable to external influence ifstreamflow regime change can be attributed to a spring temperatureincrease and if the spring temperature increase can be attributed to
external forcings (though these changes may not necessarily be linked to
changes in floods; Section 3.5.2). If the chain of processes is established
(e.g., in this case additionally supported by the physical understandingthat snow melts earlier as spring temperature increases), the confidence
in the overall assessment would be similar to, or weaker than, the lower
confidence in the two steps in the assessment. In cases where theunderlying physical mechanisms are less certain, such as those linking
tropical cyclones and sea surface temperature (see Section 3.4.4), the
confidence in multi-step attribution can be severely undermined. Anecessary condition for multi-step attribution is to establish the chain ofmechanisms responsible for the specific extremes being considered.
Physically based process studies and sensitivity experiments that helpthe physical understanding (e.g., Findell and Delworth, 2005;
Seneviratne et al., 2006a; Haarsma et al., 2009) can possibly play a rolein developing such multi-step attributions.Extreme events are rare, which means that there are also few data
available to make assessments regarding changes in their frequency orintensity (Section 3.2.1). When a rare and high-impact meteorologicalextreme event occurs, a question that is often posed is whether such anevent is due to anthropogenic influence. Because it is very difficult torule out the occurrence of low-probability events in an unchangedclimate and because the occurrence of such events usually involvesmultiple factors, it is very difficult to attribute an individual event toexternal forcing (Allen, 2003; Hegerl et al., 2007; Dole et al., 2011; seealso FAQ 3.2). However, in this case, it may be possible to estimatethe influence of external forcing on the likelihood of such an eventoccurring (e.g., Stott et al., 2004; Pall et al., 2011; Zwiers et al., 2011).
3.2.3. Projected Long-Term Changes and Uncertainties
In this section we discuss the requirements and methods used forpreparing climate change projections, with a focus on projections ofextremes and the associated uncertainties. The discussion draws on theAR4 (Christensen et al., 2007; Meehl et al., 2007b; Randall et al., 2007)with consideration of some additional issues relevant to projections ofextremes in the context of risk and disaster management. More detailedassessments of projections for specific extremes are provided inSections 3.3 to 3.5. Summaries of these assessments are provided inTable 3-1. Overviews of projected regional changes in temperatureextremes, heavy precipitation, and dryness are provided in Table 3-3(see pages 196-202).
3.2.3.1. Information Sources for Climate Change Projections
Work on the construction, assessment, and communication of climatechange projections, including regional projections and of extremes,draws on information from four sources: (1) GCMs; (2) downscaling ofGCM simulations; (3) physical understanding of the processes governingregional responses; and (4) recent historical climate change (Christensenet al., 2007; Knutti et al., 2010b). At the time of the AR4, GCMs were themain source of globally available regional information on the range ofpossible future climates including extremes (Christensen et al., 2007).This is still the case for many regions, as can be seen in Table 3-3.
The AR4 concluded that statistics of extreme events for present-day
climate, especially temperature, are generally well simulated by currentGCMs at the global scale (Randall et al., 2007). Precipitation extremesare, however, less well simulated (Randall et al., 2007; Box 3-2). Asthey continue to develop, and their spatial resolution as well as theircomplexity continues to improve, GCMs could become increasingly usefulfor investigating smaller-scale features, including changes in extremeweather events. However, when we wish to project climate and weatherextremes, not all atmospheric phenomena potentially of relevance canbe realistically or explicitly simulated. GCMs include a number ofapproximations, known as parameterizations, of processes (e.g., relatingto clouds) that cannot be fully resolved in climate models. Furthermore,Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment129the assessment of climate model performance with respect to extremes
(summarized in Sections 3.3 to 3.5 for specific extremes), particularly atthe regional scale, is still limited by the rarity of extreme events thatmakes evaluation of model performance less robust than is the case foraverage climate. Evaluation is further hampered by incomplete data onthe historical frequency and severity of extreme s, particularly for variables
other than temperature and precipitation, and for specific regions(Section 3.2.1; Table 3-2).
The requirement for projections of extreme events has provided one of
the motivations for the development of regionalization or downscalingtechniques (Carter et al., 2007). These have been specifically developedfor the study of regional- and local-scale climate change, to simulateweather and climate at finer spatial resolutions than is possible withGCMs – a step that is particularly relevant for many extremes giventheir spatial scale. These techniques are, nonetheless, constrained by thereliability of large-scale information coming from GCMs. Recentadvances in downscaling for extremes are discussed below. 
As indicated in the Glossary, downscaling “is a method that derives local-
to regional-scale (up to 100 km) information from larger-scale modelsor data analyses.” Two main methods are distinguished: dynamicaldownscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling (Christensen et al.,2007). The dynamical method uses the output of regional climatemodels (RCMs), global models with variable spatial resolution, or high-resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods developstatistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variableswith local/regional climate variables. In all cases, the quality of thedownscaled product depends on the quality of the driving model.Dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques are briefly introducedhereafter. Specific limitations that need to be considered in the evalua tion
of projections are also discussed in Section 3.2.3.2.
The most common approach to dynamical downscaling uses high-
resolution RCMs, currently at scales of 20 to 50 km, but in some casesdown to 10 to 15 km (e.g., Dankers et al., 2007), to represent regionalsub-domains, using either observed (reanalysis) or lower-resolutionGCM data to provide their boundary conditions. Using non-hydrostatic
mesoscale models, applications at 1- to 5-km resolution are also possible
for shorter periods (typically a few months, a few full years at most) – a
scale at which clouds and convection can be explicitly resolved and the
diurnal cycle tends to be better resolved (e.g., Grell et al., 2000; Hay et al.,
2006; Hohenegger et al., 2008; Kanada et al., 2010b). Less commonly
used approaches to dynamical downscaling involve the use of
stretched-grid (variable resolution) models and high-resolution ‘time-
slice’ models (e.g., Cubasch et al., 1995; Gibelin and Deque, 2003;Coppola and Giorgi, 2005) with the latter including some simulations at
20 km globally (Kamiguchi et al., 2006; Kitoh et al., 2009; Kim et al.,
2010). The main advantage of dynamical downscaling is its potential forcapturing mesoscale nonlinear effects and providing information for
many climate variables at a relatively high spatial resolution, although
still not as high as some require. Dynamical downscaling cannot provide
information at the point (i.e., weather station) scale (a scale at whichthe RCM and GCM parameterizations would not work). Like GCMs,
RCMs provide precipitation averaged over a grid cell, which means atendency to more days of light precipitation (Frei et al., 2003; Barring etal., 2006) and reduced magnitude of extremes (Chen and Knutson,2008; Haylock et al., 2008) compared with point values. These scalingissues need to be considered when evaluating the ability of RCMs andGCMs to simulate precipitation and other extremes.
Statistical downscaling methods use relationships between large-scale
fields (predictors) and local-scale surface variables (predictands) thathave been derived from observed data, and apply these to equivalentlarge-scale fields simulated by climate models (Christensen et al., 2007).They may also include weather generators that provide the basis for anumber of recently developed user tools that can be used to assesschanges in extreme events (Kilsby et al., 2007; Burton et al., 2008; Qian etal., 2008; Semenov, 2008). Statistical downscaling has been demonstratedto have potential in a number of different regions including Europe(e.g., Schmidli et al., 2007), Africa (e.g., Hewitson and Crane, 2006),Australia (e.g., Timbal et al., 2008, 2009), South America (e.g., D’Onofrioet al., 2010) and North America (e.g., Vrac et al., 2007; Dibike et al.,2008). Statistical downscaling methods are able to access finer spatialscales than dynamical methods and can be applied to parameters thatcannot be directly obtained from RCMs. Seasonal indices of extremescan, for example, be simulated directly without having to first producedaily time series (Haylock et al., 2006a), or distribution functions ofextremes can be simulated (Benestad, 2007). However, statisticaldownscaling methods require observational data at the desired scale(e.g., the point or station scale) for a long enough period to allow themodel to be well trained and validated, and in some methods can lackcoherency among multiple climate variables and/or multiple sites. Onespecific disadvantage of some, but not all, methods based on theanalog approach is that they cannot produce extreme events greater inmagnitude than have been observed before (Timbal et al., 2009).Moreover, statistical downscaling does not allow for the possibility offuture process-based changes in relationships between predictors andpredictands (see Section 3.2.3.2). There have been few systematicintercomparisons of dynamical and statistical downscaling approachesfocusing on extremes (Fowler et al., 2007b). Two examples focus onextreme precipitation for the United Kingdom (Haylock et al., 2006a) andthe Alps (Schmidli et al., 2007), respectively. A few hybrid statistico-dynamical downscaling methods also exist, including a two-stepapproach used to downscale heavy precipitation events in southernFrance (Beaulant et al., 2011). A conceptually similar cascading techniquehas also been used to downscale tropical cyclones (Bender et al., 2010;see Section 3.4.4).
In terms of temporal resolution, while GCMs and RCMs operate at
sub-daily time steps, model output at six-hourly or shorter temporalresolutions, which is desirable for some applications such as urbandrainage, is less widely available than daily output. Where limitedstudies have been undertaken, there is evidence that at the typicalspatial resolutions used (i.e., non-cloud/convection-resolving scales),RCMs do not adequately represent sub-daily precipitation and the
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment130diurnal cycle of convection (Gutowski et al., 2003; Brockhaus et al.,
2008; Lenderink and Van Meijgaard, 2008). Development of sub-dailystatistical downscaling methods is constrained by the availability oflong observed time series for calibration and validation and thisapproach is not currently widely used for climate change applications,although some weather generators, for example, do provide hourlyinformation (Maraun et al., 2010).
It is not possible in this chapter to provide assessments of projected
changes in extremes at spatial scales smaller than for large regions(Table 3-3). These large-region projections provide a wider context fornational or more local projections, where they exist, and, where they donot, a first indication of expected changes, their associated uncertainties,and the evidence available. Several countries, for example in Europe,North America, Australia, and some other regions, have developednational or sub-national projections (generally based on dynamicaland/or statistical downscaling), including information about extremes,and a range of other high-resolution information and tools are availablefrom national weather and hydrological services and academic institutionsto assist users and decisionmakers.
3.2.3.2. Uncertainty Sources in Climate Change Projections
Uncertainty in climate change projections arises at each of the stepsinvolved in their preparation: determination of greenhouse gas andaerosol precursor emissions (driven by socioeconomic developmentand represented through the use of multiple emissions scenarios),concentrations of radiatively active species, radiative forcing, and climateresponse including downscaling. Also, uncertainty in the estimation ofthe true ‘signal’ of climate change is introduced by both errors in themodel representation of Earth system processes and by internal climatevariability. 
As was noted in Section 3.2.3.1, most shortcomings in GCMs and
RCMs result from the fact that many important small-scale processes(e.g., representations of clouds, convection, land surface processes) arenot represented explicitly (Randall et al., 2007). Some processes –particularly those involving feedbacks (Section 3.1.4), and this is
especially the case for climate extremes and associated impacts – arestill poorly represented and/or understood (e.g., land-atmosphereinteractions, ocean-atmosphere interactions, stratospheric processes,
blocking dynamics) despite some improvements in the simulations ofothers (see Box 3-2 and below). Therefore, limitations in computing
power and in the scientific understanding of some physical processes
currently restrict further global and regional climate model improve ments.
In addition, uncertainty due to structural or parameter errors in GCMs
propagates directly from global model simulations as input to RCMsand thus to downscaled information. 
These problems limit quantitative assessments of the magnitude and
timing, as well as regional details, of some aspects of projected climatechange. For instance, even atmospheric models with approximately 20-kmhorizontal resolution still do not resolve the atmospheric processes
sufficiently finely to simulate the high wind speeds and low pressurecenters of the most intense hurricanes (Knutson et al., 2010).Realistically capturing details of such intense hurricanes, such as theinner eyewall structure, would require models with 1-km horizontalresolution, far beyond the capabilities of current GCMs and of mostcurrent RCMs (and even global numerical weather prediction models).Extremes may also be impacted by mesoscale circulations that GCMsand even current RCMs cannot resolve, such as low-level jets and theircoupling with intense precipitation (Anderson et al., 2003; Menendez etal., 2010). Another issue with small-scale processes is the lack of relevantobservations, such as is the case with soil moisture and vegetationprocesses (Section 3.2.1) and relevant parameters (e.g., maps of soil typesand associated properties, see for instance Seneviratne et al., 2006b;Anders and Rockel, 2009).
Since many extreme events, such as those associated with precipitation,
occur at rather small temporal and spatial scales, where climatesimulation skill is currently limited and local conditions are highlyvariable, projections of future changes cannot always be made with ahigh level of confidence (Easterling et al., 2008). The credibility ofprojections of changes in extremes varies with extreme type, season, andgeographical region (Box 3-2). Confidence and credibility in projectedchanges in extremes increase when the physical mechanisms producingextremes in models are considered reliable, such as increases in specifichumidity in the case of the projected increase in the proportion of summerprecipitation falling as intense events in central Europe (Kendon et al.,2010). The ability of a model to capture the full distribution of variables– not just the mean – together with long-term trends in extremes,implies that some of the processes relevant to a future warming worldmay be captured (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009; van Oldenborgh et al.,2009). It should nonetheless be stressed that physical consistency ofsimulations with observed behavior provides necessary but not sufficientevidence for credible projections (Gutowski et al., 2008a). 
While downscaling provides more spatial detail (Section 3.2.3.1), the
added value of this step and the reliability of projections always needsto be assessed (Benestad et al., 2007; Laprise et al., 2008). A potentiallimitation and source of uncertainty in downscaling methods is that thecalibration of statistical models and the parameterization schemes usedin dynamical models are necessarily based on present (and past) climate(as well as an understanding of physical processes). Thus they may notbe able to capture changes in extremes that are induced by futuremechanistic changes in regional (or global) climate, that is, if usedoutside the range for which they were designed (Christensen et al.,2007). Spatial inhomogeneity of both land use/land cover and aerosolforcing adds to regional uncertainty. This means that the factors inducinguncertainty in the projections of extremes in different regions maydiffer considerably. Some specific issues inducing uncertainties in RCMprojections are the interactions with the driving GCM, especially interms of biases and climate change signal (e.g., de Elía et al., 2008;Laprise et al., 2008; Kjellström and Lind, 2009; Déqué et al., 2011) andthe choice of regional domain (Wang et al., 2004; Laprise et al., 2008).Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment131In the case of statistical downscaling, uncertainties are induced by,
inter alia , the definition and choice of predictors (Benestad, 2001;
Hewitson and Crane, 2006; Timbal et al., 2008) and the underlyingassumption of stationarity (Raje and Mujumdar, 2010). In general, bothapproaches to downscaling are maturing and being more widely appliedbut are still restricted in terms of geographical coverage (Maraun et al.,2010). For many regions of the world, no downscaled information existsat all and regional projections rely only on information from GCMs (seeTable 3-3).
For many user-driven applications, impact models need to be included
as an additional step for projections (e.g., hydrological or ecosystemmodels). Because of the previously mentioned issues of scale discrepan cies
and overall biases, it is necessary to bias-correct RCM data before inputto some impacts models (i.e., to bring the statistical properties of present-
day simulations in line with observations and to use this information tocorrect projections). A number of bias correction methods, includingquantile mapping and gamma transform, have recently been developedand exhibit promising skill for extremes of daily precipitation (Piani etal., 2010; Themeßl et al., 2011).
3.2.3.3. Ways of Exploring and Quantifying Uncertainties
Uncertainties can be explored, and quantified to some extent, throughthe combined use of observations and reanalyses, process understand ing,
a hierarchy of climate models, and ensemble simulations. Ensembles ofmodel simulations represent a fundamental resource for studying therange of plausible climate responses to a given forcing (Meehl et al.,2007b; Randall et al., 2007). Such ensembles can be generated either by(i) collecting results from a range of models from different modellingcenters (multi-model ensembles), to include the impact of structuralmodel differences; (ii) by generating simulations with different initialconditions (intra-model ensembles) to characterize the uncertaintiesdue to internal climate variability; or (iii) varying multiple internal modelparameters within plausible ranges (perturbed and stochastic physicsensembles), with both (ii) and (iii) aiming to produce a more systematicestimate of single model uncertainty (Knutti et al., 2010b).
Many of the global models utilized for the AR4 were integrated as
ensembles, permitting more robust statistical analysis than is possible if amodel is only integrated to produce a single projection. Thus the availableCMIP3 Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) GCM simulations reflect both inter-
and intra-model variability. In advance of AR4, coordinated climate change
experiments were undertaken which provided information from 23 modelsfrom around the world (Meehl et al., 2007a). The CMIP3 simulations
were made available at the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
Intercomparison (www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php). However,
the higher temporal resolution (i.e., daily) data necessary to analyzemost extreme events were quite incomplete in the archive, with only
four models providing daily averaged output with ensemble sizesgreater than three realizations and many models not included at all.
GCMs are expensive to run, thus a compromise is needed between thenumber of models, number of simulations, and the complexity of the
models (Knutti, 2010). 
Besides the uncertainty due to randomness itself, which is the canonical
statistical definition, it is important to distinguish between the uncertaintydue to insufficient agreement in the model projections, the uncertainty
due to insufficient evidence (insufficient observational data to constrain
the model projections or insufficient number of simulations from differentmodels or insufficient understanding of the physical processes), and theuncertainty induced by insufficient literature , which refers to the lack of
published analyses of projections. For instance, models may agree on aprojected change, but if this change is controlled by processes that arenot well understood and validated in the present climate, then there isan inherent uncertainty in the projections, no matter how good themodel agreement may be. Similarly, available model projections mayagree in a given change, but the number of available simulations mayrestrain the reliability of the inferred agreement (e.g., because theanalyses need to be based on daily data that may not be available fromall modelling groups). All these issues have been taken into account in
assessing the confidence and likelihood of projected changes inextremes for this report (see Section 3.1.5).
Uncertainty analysis of the CMIP3 MME in AR4 focused essentially on the
seasonal mean and inter-model standard deviation values (Christensen etal., 2007; Meehl et al., 2007b; Randall et al., 2007). In addition, confidencewas assessed in the AR4 through simple quantification of the number ofmodels that show agreement in the sign of a specific climate change(e.g., sign of the change in frequency of extremes) – assuming that thegreater the number of models in agreement, the greater the robustness.However, the shortcoming of this definition of model agreement is thatit does not take account of possible common biases among models.Indeed, the ensemble was strictly an ‘ensemble of opportunity,’ withoutsampling protocol, and the possible dependence of different models onone another (e.g., due to shared parameterizations) was not assessed(Knutti et al., 2010a). Furthermore, this particular metric, which assessessign agreement only, can provide misleading conclusions in cases, forexample, where the projected changes are near zero. For this reason, inour assessments of projected changes in extreme indices we considerthe model agreement as a necessary but not a sufficient condition forlikelihood statements [e.g., agreement of 66% of the models, as indicatedwith shading in several of the figures (Figures 3-3, 3-4, 3-6, 3-8, and3-10), is a minimum but not a sufficient condition for a change beingconsidered ‘ likely ’].
Post-AR4 studies have concentrated more on the use of the MME in
order to better characterize uncertainty in climate change projections,including those of extremes (Kharin et al., 2007; Gutowski et al., 2008a;Perkins et al., 2009). New techniques have been developed for exploitingthe full ensemble information, in some cases using observationalconstraints to construct probability distributions (Tebaldi and Knutti,2007; Tebaldi and Sanso, 2009), although issues such as determiningappropriate metrics for weighting models are challenging (Knutti et al.,2010a). Perturbed-physics ensembles have also become available (e.g.,Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment132Collins et al., 2006; Murphy et al., 2007) and used to examine projected
changes in extremes and their uncertainties (Barnett et al., 2006; Clark
et al., 2006, 2010; Burke and Brown, 2008). Advances have also beenmade in developing probabilistic information at regional scales from
the GCM simulations, but there has been rather less developmentextending this to probabilistic downscaled regional information and toChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
Box 3-2 | Variations in Confidence in Projections of Climate Change:
Mean versus Extremes, Variables, Scale
Comparisons of observed and simulated climate demonstrate good agreement for some climate variables such as mean temperature,
especially at large horizontal scales (e.g., Räisänen, 2007). For instance, Figure 9.12 of the AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) compar es the ability
of 14 climate models to simulate the temporal variations of mean temperature through the 20th century. When the models includedboth natural and anthropogenic forcings, they consistently reproduced the decadal variations in global mean temperature. Withou t the
anthropogenic influences the models consistently failed to reproduce the multi-decadal temperature variations. However, when th e same
models’ abilities to simulate the temperature variations for smaller domains were assessed, although the mean temperature produ ced by
the ensemble generally tracked the observed temperature changes, the consistency among the models was poorer than was the case for
the global mean (Figure 9.12; Hegerl et al., 2007), partly because averaging over global scales smoothes internal variability o r ‘noise’
more than averaging over smaller domains (see also Section 3.2.2.1). We can conclude that the smaller the spatial domain for wh ich
simulations or projections are being prepared, the less confidence we should have in these projections (although in some limite d cases
regional-scale projections can have higher reliability than larger-scale projections; see Section 3.1.6).
This increased uncertainty at smaller scales results from larger internal variability at smaller scales or ‘noise’ (i.e., natur al variability
unrelated to external forcings) and increased model uncertainty, both of which lead to lower model consistency at these scales (Hawkins
and Sutton, 2009). The latter factor is largely due to the role of unresolved processes (representations of clouds, convection,  land surface
processes; see also Section 3.2.3). Hawkins and Sutton (2009) also point out regional variations in these aspects: in the tropi cs the
temperature signal expected from anthropogenic factors is large relative to the model uncertainty and the natural variability, compared
with higher latitudes. Figure 9.12 from AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) also shows that the models are more consistent in reproducing  decadal
temperature variations in the tropics than at higher latitudes, even though the magnitudes of the temperature trends are larger  at higher
latitudes. 
Uncertainty in projections also depends on the variables, phenomena, or impacts considered (Sections 3.3. to 3.5.). There is mo re model
uncertainty for variables other than temperature, for instance precipitation (Räisänen, 2007; Hawkins and Sutton, 2011; see als o
Section 3.2.3). And the situation is more difficult again for extremes. For instance, climate models simulate observed changes in extreme
temperatures relatively well, but the frequency, distribution, and intensity of heavy precipitation is more poorly simulated (R andall et al.,
2007) as are observed changes in heavy precipitation (e.g., Alexander and Arblaster, 2009). Also, projections of changes in tem perature
extremes tend to be more consistent across climate models (in terms of sign) than for (wet and dry) precipitation extremes (Teb aldi et
al., 2006; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011; see also Figures 3-3 through 3-7 and 3-10) and significant inconsistencies are also found for
projections of agricultural (soil moisture) droughts (Wang, 2005; see also Box 3-3; Figure 3-10). For some other extremes, such  as tropical
cyclones, differences in the regional-scale climate change projections between models can lead to marked differences in project ed tropical
cyclone activity associated with anthropogenic climate change (Knutson et al., 2010), and thus decrease confidence in projectio ns of
changes in that extreme.
The relative importance of various causes of uncertainties in projections is somewhat different for earlier compared with later  future
periods. For some variables (mean temperature, temperature extremes), the choice of emission scenario becomes more critical tha n
model uncertainty for the second part of the 21st century (Tebaldi et al., 2006; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009, 2011) though this do es not
apply for mean precipitation and some precipitation-related extremes (Tebaldi et al., 2006; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009, 2011), an d has in
particular not been evaluated in detail for a wide range of extremes. Users need to be aware of such issues in deciding the ran ge of
uncertainties that is appropriate to consider for their particular risk or impacts assessment
In summary, confidence in climate change projections depends on the (temporal and spatial) scale and variable being considered and
whether one considers extremes or mean quantities. Confidence is highest for temperature, especially at the global scale, and d ecreases
when other variables are considered, and when we focus on smaller spatial domains (Tables 3-1 and 3-3). Confidence in projectio ns for
extremes is generally weaker than for projections of long-term averages.133extremes (Fowler et al., 2007a; Fowler and Ekstrom, 2009). Perhaps the
most comprehensive approach to date for quantifying the influence ofthe cascade of uncertainties in regional projections is that used todevelop the recent United Kingdom Climate Projections (UKCP09;Murphy et al., 2009). A complex Bayesian framework is used to combinea perturbed physics ensemble exploring uncertainties in atmosphereand ocean processes, and the carbon and sulfur cycles, with structuraluncertainty (represented by 12 CMIP3 models) and an 11-member RCMperturbed physics ensemble. The published projections provide probabilitydistributions of changes in various parameters including the wettest andhottest days of each season for 25-km grid squares across the UnitedKingdom. These probabilities are conditional on the emissions scenario(low, medium, high) and are described as representing the “relative degreeto which each climate outcome is supported by the evidence currentlyavailable, taking into account our understanding of climate science andobservations, and using expert judgment” (Murphy et al., 2009).
Both statistical and dynamical downscaling methods are affected by
the uncertainties that affect the global models, and a further level ofuncertainty associated with the downscaling step also needs to betaken into consideration (see also Sections 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2). Theincreasing availability of coordinated RCM simulations for differentregions permits more systematic exploration of dynamical downscalinguncertainty. Such simulations are available for Europe (e.g., Christensenand Christensen, 2007; van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009) and a fewother regions such as North America (Mearns et al., 2009) and WestAfrica (van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009; Hourdin et al., 2010). RCMintercomparisons have also been undertaken for a number of regionsincluding Asia (Fu et al., 2005), South America (Menendez et al., 2010) andthe Arctic (Inoue et al., 2006). A new series of coordinated simulationscovering the globe is planned (Giorgi et al., 2009). Increasingly, RCMoutput from coordinated simulations is made available at the daily timescale, facilitating the analysis of some extreme events. Nevertheless, itis important to point out that ensemble runs with RCMs currentlyinvolve a limited number of driving GCMs, and hence only subsampleuncertainty space. Ensuring adequate sampling of RCM simulations (bothin terms of the number of considered RCMs and number of considereddriving GCMs) may be more important for extremes than for changes in
mean values (Frei et al., 2006; Fowler et al., 2007a). Internal variability,
for example, has been shown to make a significant contribution to
the spectrum of variability on at least multi-annual time scales and
potentially up to multi-decadal time scales (Kendon et al., 2008;Hawkins and Sutton, 2009, 2011; Box 3-2). 
3.3. Observed and Projected Changes in
Weather and Climate Extremes
3.3.1. Temperature
Temperature is associated with several types of extremes, for example,
heat waves and cold spells, and related impacts, for example, on humanhealth, the physical environment, ecosystems, and energy consumption(e.g., Chapter 4, Sections 3.5.6 and 3.5.7; see also Case Studies 
9.2.1
and 9.2.10 ). Temperature extremes often occur on weather time scales
that require daily or higher time scale resolution data to accuratelyassess possible changes (Section 3.2.1). It is important to distinguishbetween daily mean, maximum (i.e., daytime), and minimum (nighttime)temperature, as well as between cold and warm extremes, due to theirdiffering impacts. Spell lengths (e.g., duration of heat waves) arerelevant for a number of impacts. Note that we do not considerhere changes in diurnal temperature range or frost days, which are nottypical ‘climate extremes’. There is an extensive body of literatureregarding the mechanisms of changes in temperature extremes (e.g.,Christensen et al., 2007; Meehl et al., 2007b; Trenberth et al., 2007).Heat waves are generally caused by quasi-stationary anticycloniccirculation anomalies or atmospheric blocking (Xoplaki et al., 2003;Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004; Cassou et al., 2005; Della-Marta et al., 2007b),and/or land-atmosphere feedbacks (in transitional climate regions),whereby the latter can act as an amplifying mechanism through reductionin evaporative cooling (Section 3.1.4), but also induce enhancedpersistence due to soil moisture memory (Lorenz et al., 2010). Also snowfeedbacks (Section 3.1.4), and possibly changes in aerosols (Portmann etal., 2009), are relevant for temperature extremes. Trends in temperatureextremes (either observed or projected) can sometimes be different forthe most extreme temperatures (e.g., annual maximum/minimum dailymaximum/minimum temperature) than for less extreme events [e.g.,cold/warm days/nights; see, for instance, Brown et al. (2008) versusAlexander et al. (2006)]. One reason for this is that ‘moderate extremes’such as warm/cold days/nights are generally computed for each daywith respect to the long-term statistics for that day, thus, for example,an increase in warm days for annual analyses does not necessarily implywarming for the very warmest days of the year. 
Observed Changes
Regional historical or paleoclimatic temperature reconstructions mayhelp place the recent instrumentally observed temperature extremes inthe context of a much longer period, but literature on this topic is verysparse and most regional reconstructions are for Europe. For exampleDobrovolny et al. (2010) reconstructed monthly and seasonal temperatureover central Europe back to 1500 using a variety of temperature proxyrecords. They concluded that the summer 2003 heat wave and the July2006 heat wave exceeded the +2 standard deviation (associated withthe reconstruction method) of previous monthly temperature extremessince 1500. Barriopedro et al. (2011) showed that the anomalously warmsummers of 2003 in western and central Europe and 2010 in easternEurope and Russia both broke the 500-year long seasonal temperaturerecord over 50% of Europe. The coldest periods within the last fivecenturies occurred in the winter and spring of 1690. Another 500-yeartemperature reconstruction was recently completed for theMediterranean basin by means of documentary data and instrumentalobservations (Camuffo et al., 2010). It suggests strong natural variabilityin the basin, possibly exceeding the recent warming, althoughdiscontinuities in the records limit the interpretation of this finding. Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment134The AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007, based on Alexander et al., 2006) reported
a statistically significant increase in the numbers of warm nights and astatistically significant reduction in the numbers of cold nights for 70 to75% of the land regions with data (for the spatial coverage of theunderlying data set and the definition of warm/cold days and nights, seeSection 3.2.1 and Box 3-1, respectively). Changes in the numbers ofwarm days and cold days also showed warming, but less markedthan for nights, with about 40 to 50% of the area with data showingstatistically significant changes consistent with warming (Alexander etal., 2006). Less than 1% of the area with data showed statisticallysignificant trends in cold/warm days and nights that were consistent withcooling (Alexander et al., 2006). Trenberth et al. (2007) 
also reported,
based on Vose et al. (2005), that from 1950 to 2004, the annual trendsin minimum and maximum land-surface air temperature averaged overregions with data were 0.20°C per decade and 0.14°C per decade,respectively, and that for 1979 to 2004, the corresponding linear trendsfor the land areas with data were 0.29°C per decade for both maximumand minimum temperature. Based on this evidence, the IPCC AR4 (SPM;IPCC, 2007b) assessed that it was very likely that there had been trends
toward warmer and more frequent warm days and warm nights, andwarmer and less frequent cold days and cold nights in most land areas. 
Regions that were found to depart from this overall behavior toward
more warm days and nights and fewer cold days and nights inAlexander et al. (2006) were mostly central North America, the easternUnited States, southern Greenland (increase in cold days and decreasesin warm days), and the southern half of South America (decrease inwarm days; no data available for the northern half of the continent). Incentral North America and the eastern United States this partial tendencyfor a negative trend in extremes is also consistent with a reported meannegative trend in temperatures, mostly in the spring to summer season(also termed ‘warming hole’, e.g., Pan et al., 2004; Portmann et al.,2009). Several explanations have been suggested for this behavior,which seems partly associated with a change in the hydrological cycle,possibly linked to soil moisture and/or aerosol feedbacks (Pan et al.,2004; Portmann et al., 2009). 
More recent analyses available since the AR4 include a global study (for
annual extremes) by Brown et al. (2008) based on the data set from
Caesar et al. (2006), and regional studies for North America (Peterson etal., 2008a; Meehl et al., 2009c), Central-Western Europe (since 1880;
Della-Marta et al., 2007a), central and eastern Europe (Bartholy andPongracz, 2007; Kürbis et al., 2009), the eastern Mediterranean region
including Turkey (Kuglitsch et al., 2010), western Central Africa, Guinea
Conakry and Zimbabwe (Aguilar et al., 2009), the Tibetan Plateau (Youet al., 2008) and China (You et al., 2011), Uruguay (Rusticucci and
Renom, 2008), and Australia (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009). Furtherreferences can also be found in Table 3-2. Overall, these studies areconsistent with the assessment of an increase in warm days and nightsand a reduction in cold days and nights on the global basis, althoughthey do not necessarily consider trends in all four variables, and a fewsingle studies report trends that are not statistically significant or even
trends opposite to the global tendencies in some extremes, subregions,seasons, or decades. For instance, Rusticucci and Renom (2008) found
in Uruguay a reduction of cold nights, a positive but a statisticallyinsignificant trend in warm nights, statistically insignificant decreases incold days at most investigated stations, and inconsistent trends inwarm days. Together with the previous results from Alexander et al.(2006) for southern South America (see above) and further regionalstudies (Table 3-2), this suggests a less consistent warming tendency inSouth America compared to other continents. Another notable feature isthat studies for central and southeastern Europe display a markedchange point in trends in temperature extremes at the end of the1970s/beginning of 1980s (Table 3-2), which for some extremes canlead to very small and/or statistically not significant overall trends sincethe 1960s (e.g., Bartholy and Pongracz, 2007). 
There are fewer studies available investigating changes in characteristics
of cold spells and warm spells, or cold waves and heat waves, comparedwith studies of the intensity or frequency of warm and cold days ornights. Alexander et al. (2006) provided an analysis of trends in warmspells [based on the Warm Spell Duration Index (WSDI); see Table 3-2and Box 3-1] mostly in the mid- and high-latitudes of the NorthernHemisphere. The analysis displays a tendency toward a higher length ornumber of warm spells (increase in number of days belonging to warmspells) in much of the region, with the exception of the southeasternUnited States and eastern Canada. Regional studies on trends in warmspells or heat waves are also listed in Table 3-2. Kunkel et al. (2008)found that the United States has experienced a general decline in coldwaves over the 20th century, with a spike of more cold waves in the1980s. Further, they report a strong increase in heat waves since 1960,although the heat waves of the 1930s associated with extreme droughtconditions still dominate the 1895-2005 time series. Kuglitsch et al.(2009) reported an increase in heat wave intensity, number, and lengthin summer over the 1960-2006 time period in the eastern Mediterraneanregion. Ding et al. (2010) reported increasing numbers of heat wavesover most of China for the 1961-2007 period. The record-breaking heatwave over western and central Europe in the summer of 2003 is anexample of an exceptional recent extreme (Beniston, 2004; Schär andJendritzky, 2004). That summer (June to August) was the hottest sincecomparable instrumental records began around 1780 and perhaps thehottest since at least 1500 (Luterbacher et al., 2004). Other examples ofrecent extreme heat waves include the 2006 heat wave in Europe(Rebetez et al., 2008), the 2007 heat wave in southeastern Europe(Founda and Giannakopoulos, 2009), the 2009 heat wave in southeasternAustralia (National Climate Centre, 2009), and the 2010 heat wave inRussia (Barriopedro et al., 2011). Both the 2003 European heat wave(Andersen et al., 2005; Ciais et al., 2005) and the 2009 southeasternAustralian heat wave were also associated with drought conditions,which can strongly enhance temperature extremes during heat waves insome regions (see also Section 3.1.4).
Some recent analyses have led to revisions of previously reported
trends. For instance, Della-Marta et al. (2007a) found that mean summermaximum temperature change over Europe was +1.6 ± 0.4°C during1880 to 2005, a somewhat greater increase than reported in earlier
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment135studies. Kuglitsch et al. (2009, 2010) homogenized and analyzed over
250 daily maximum and minimum temperature series in theMediterranean region since 1960, and found that after homogenizationthe positive trends in the frequency of hot days and heat waves in theEastern Mediterranean region were higher than reported in earlier studies.This was due to the correction of many warm-biased temperature datain the region during the 1960s and 1970s.
In summary, regional and global analyses of temperature extremes on
land generally show recent changes consistent with a warming climate
at the global scale, in agreement with the previous assessment in AR4.
Only a few regions show changes in temperature extremes consistent
with cooling, most notably for some extremes in central North America,
the eastern United States, and also parts of South America. Based on the
available evidence we conclude that it is very likely that there has been
an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights and very likely
that there has been an overall increase in the number of warm days and
nights in most regions, that is, for land areas with data (corresponding
to about 70 to 80% of all land areas; see Table 3-2). It is likely that this
statement applies at the continental scale in North America, Europe,
and Australia (Table 3-2). However , some subregions on these continents
have had warming trends in temperature extremes that were small or notstatistically significant (e.g., southeastern Europe), and a few subregions
have had cooling trends in some temperature extremes (e.g., central NorthAmerica and eastern United States). Asia also shows trends consistentwith warming in most of the continent, but which are assessed here tobe of medium confidence because of lack of literature for several regions
apart from the global study from Alexander et al. (2006). Most of Africais insufficiently well sampled to allow an overall likelihood statement tobe made at the continental scale, although most of the regions on thiscontinent for which data are available have exhibited warming intemperature extremes (Table 3-2). In South America, both lack of dataand some inconsistencies in the reported trends imply low confidence in
the overall trends at the continental scale (Table 3-2). In many (but notall) regions with sufficient data there is medium confidence that the
number of warm spells or heat waves has increased since the middle ofthe 20th century (Table 3-2). 
Causes of Observed Changes
The AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) concluded that surface temperatureextremes have likely been affected by anthropogenic forcing. This
assessment was based on multiple lines of evidence of temperatureChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment

number of warm extremes and decrease in the number of cold extremesat that scale (Alexander et al., 2006). Hegerl et al. (2007) also state thatanthropogenic forcing may have substantially increased the risk ofextreme temperatures (Christidis et al., 2005) and of the 2003 Europeanheat wave (Stott et al., 2004).
Recent studies on attribution of changes in temperature extremes have
tended to reaffirm the conclusions reached in the AR4. Alexander andArblaster (2009) found that trends in warm nights over Australia couldonly be reproduced by a coupled model that included anthropogenicforcings. As part of the recent report of the US Climate Change ScienceProgram (CCSP , 2008), Gutowski et al. (2008a) concluded that most ofthe observed changes in temperature extremes for the second half ofthe 20th century over the United States can be attributed to humanactivity. They compared observed changes in the number of frost days,the length of growing season, the number of warm nights, and the heatwave intensity with those simulated in a nine-member multi-modelensemble simulation. The decrease in frost days, an increase in growingseason length, and an increase in heat wave intensity all show similarchanges over the United States in 20th-century experiments thatcombine anthropogenic and natural forcings, though the relativecontributions of each are unclear.
Results from two global coupled climate models with separate
anthropogenic and natural forcing runs indicate that the observedchanges are simulated with anthropogenic forcings, but not with naturalforcings (even though there are some differences in the details of theforcings). Zwiers et al. (2011) compared observed annual temperatureextremes including annual maximum daily maximum and minimumtemperatures, and annual minimum daily maximum and minimumtemperatures with those simulated responses to anthropogenic forcing oranthropogenic and natural external forcings combined by multiple GCMs.They fitted probability distributions (Box 3-1) to the observed extremetemperatures with a time-evolving pattern of location parameters asobtained from the model simulations, and found that both anthropogenicinfluence and the combined influence of anthropogenic and naturalforcing can be detected in all four extreme temperature variables at the
global scale over the land, and also over many large land areas.
Globally, return periods for events that were expected to recur once
every 20 years in the 1960s are now estimated to exceed 30 years forextreme annual minimum daily maximum temperature and 35 years for
extreme annual minimum daily minimum temperature, although these
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. Further, return peri-
ods were found to have decreased to less than 10 or 15 years for annual
maximum daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures respectively(Figure 3-2).
However, the available detection and attribution studies for extreme
maximum and minimum temperatures (Christidis et al., 2011b; Zwierset al., 2011) suggest that the models overestimate changes in the
maximum temperatures and underestimate changes in the minimum
temperatures during the late 20th century.Projected Changes and Uncertainties
Regarding projections of extreme temperatures, the AR4 (Meehl et al.,2007b) noted that cold episodes were projected to decrease significantlyin a future warmer climate and considered it very likely that heat waves
would be more intense, more frequent, and last longer in a future warmer
climate. Post-AR4 studies of temperature extremes have utilized larger
model ensembles (Kharin et al., 2007; Sterl et al., 2008; Orlowsky andSeneviratne, 2011) and generally confirm the conclusions of the AR4, whilealso providing more specific assessments both in terms of the range ofconsidered extremes and the level of regional detail (see also Table 3-3). 
There are few global analyses of multi-model projections of temperature
extremes available in the literature. The study by Tebaldi et al. (2006),which provided the basis for extreme projections given in the AR4(Figures 10.18 and 10.19 in Meehl et al., 2007b), provided global analysesof projected changes (A1B scenario) in several extremes indices basedon nine GCMs (note that not all modelling groups that saved daily dataalso calculated the indices). For temperature extremes, analyses wereprovided for heat wave lengths (using only one index, see discussion inBox 3-1) and warm nights. Stippling was used where five out of ninemodels displayed statistically significant changes of the same sign.Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011) recently updated the analysis fromTebaldi et al. (2006) for the full ensemble of GCMs that contributed A2scenarios to the CMIP3, using a larger number of extreme indices[including several additional analyses of daily extremes (see Figures 3-3and 3-4), and three heat wave indices instead of one; see also discussionof heat wave indices in Box 3-1], using other thresholds for display andstippling of the figures (no results displayed if less than 66% of themodels agree on the sign of change; stippling used only for 90% modelagreement), and providing seasonal analyses. This analysis confirmsthat strong agreement (in terms of sign of change) exists between thevarious GCM projections for temperature-related extremes, withprojected increases in warm day occurrences (Figure 3-3) and heat wavelength, and decreases in cold extremes (Figure 3-4). Temperatureextremes on land are projected to warm faster than global annual meantemperature in many regions and seasons, implying large changes inextremes in some places, even for a global warming of 2 or 3°C (withscaling factors for the SRES A2 scenario ranging between 0.5 and 2 formoderate seasonal extremes; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). Basedon the analyses of Tebaldi et al. (2006) and Orlowsky and Seneviratne(2011), as well as physical considerations, we assess that increases inthe number of warm days and nights and decreases in the number ofcold days and nights (defined with respect to present regional climate,i.e., the 1961-1990 reference period, see Box 3-1) are virtually certain at
the global scale. Further, given the assessed changes in hot and colddays and nights and available analyses of projected changes in heatwave length in the two studies, we assess that it is very likely that the
length, frequency, and/or intensity of heat waves will increase overmost land areas. 
Another global study of changes in extremes based on the CMIP3
ensemble is provided in Kharin et al. (2007), which focuses on changesChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment137in annual extremes (20-year extreme values) based on 12 GCMs for
temperature extremes and 14 GCMs for precipitation extremes employingthe SRES A2, A1B, and B1 emissions scenarios. This analysis projectsincreases in the temperature of the 1-in-20 year annual extreme hottestday of about 2 to 6°C (depending on region and scenario; Figure 3-5adapted from Kharin et al., 2007) and strong reductions in the returnperiods of this extreme event by the end of the 21st century. However,as noted above, the limited number of relevant detection and attributionstudies suggests that models may overestimate some changes intemperature extremes, and our assessments take this into account byreducing the level of certainty in the assessments from what would bederived by uncritical acceptance of the projections in Figure 3-5. Theassessments are also weakened to reflect the possibility that someimportant processes relevant to extremes may be missing or be poorlyrepresented in models, as well as the fact that the model projectionsconsidered in this study did not correspond to the full CMIP3 ensemble.Hence, we assess that in terms of absolute values, the 20-year extremeannual daily maximum temperature (i.e., return value) will likely
increase by about 2 to 5°C by the late 21st century, and by about 1 to3°C by mid-21st century, depending on the region and emissions sce nario
(considering the B1, A1B, and A2 scenarios; Figure 3-5a). Furthermore,we assess that globally under the A2 and A1B scenarios a 1-in-20 year
annual extreme hot day is likely to become a 1-in-2 year annual extreme
by the end of the 21st century in most regions, except in the high latitudesof the Northern Hemisphere where it is likely to become a 1-in-5 year
annual extreme (Figure 3-5b, based on material from Kharin et al.,2007). Further, we assess that under the more moderate B1 scenario acurrent 1-in-20 year extreme would likely become a 1-in-5 year event
(and a 1-in-10 year event in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes).
Next, regional assessments of projected changes in temper ature extremes
are provided. More details are found in Table 3-3. For North America, the
CCSP reached the following conclusions (using IPCC AR4 likelihoodterminology) regarding projected changes in temperature extremes bythe end of the 21st century (Gutowski et al., 2008a):
1)Abnormally hot days and warm nights and heat waves are very likely
to become more frequent.
2)Cold days and cold nights are very likely to become much less
frequent.
3)For a mid-range scenario (A1B) of future greenhouse gas emissions,
a day so hot that it is currently experienced only once every 20years would occur every 3 years by the middle of the century overChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment

Percentage of Days−40−20 0 20 40
Figure 3-3 | Projected annual and seasonal changes in three indices for daily Tmax for 2081-2100 with respect to 1980-1999, based on 14 GCMs  contributing to the CMIP3.
Left column: fraction of warm days (days in which Tmax exceeds the 90th percentile of that day of the year, calculated from the  1961-1990 reference period); middle column:
fraction of cold days (days in which Tmax is lower than the 10th percentile of that day of the year, calculated from the 1961-1 990 reference period); right column: percentage of
days with Tmax >30°C. The changes are computed for the annual time scale (top row) and two seasons (December-January-February, DJF , middle row, and June-July-August, JJA,
bottom row) as the fractions/percentages in the 2081-2100 period (based on simulations for emission scenario SRES A2) minus the  fractions/percentages of the 1980-1999 period
(from corresponding simulations for the 20th century). Warm day and cold day changes are expressed in units of standard deviati ons, derived from detrended per year annual or
seasonal estimates, respectively, from the three 20-year periods 1980-1999, 2046-2065, and 2081-2100 pooled together. Tmax >30° C changes are given directly as differences in
percentage points. Color shading is only applied for areas where at least 66% (i.e., 10 out of 14) of the GCMs agree on the sig n of the change; stippling is applied for regions
where at least 90% (i.e.,13 out of 14) of the GCMs agree on the sign of the change. Adapted from Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011 ); updating Tebaldi et al. (2006) for additional
number of indices and CMIP3 models, and including seasonal time frames. For more details, see Appendix 3.A.138much of the continental United States and every 5 years over most
of Canada; by the end of the century, it would occur every otheryear or more.
Meehl et al. (2009c) examined changes in record daily high and lowtemperatures in the United States and show that even with projectedstrong warming resulting in many more record highs than lows, theoccasional record low is still set. For Australia, the CMIP3 ensembleprojected increases in warm nights (15-40% by the end of the 21stcentury) and heat wave duration, together with a decrease in the numberof frost days (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009). Inland regions showgreater warming compared with coastal zones (Suppiah et al., 2007;Alexander and Arblaster, 2009) and large increases in the number of
days above 35 or 40°C are indicated (Suppiah et al., 2007). For theentire South American region, a study with a single RCM projected more
frequent warm nights and fewer cold nights (Marengo et al., 2009a).
Several studies of regional and global model projections of changes in
extremes are available for the European continent (see also Table 3-3).Analyses of both global and regional model outputs show major
increases in warm temperature extremes across the Mediterranean
region including events such as hot days (Tmax >30°C) and tropicalnights (Tmin>20°C) (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009; Tolika et al., 2009).Comparison of RCM projections using the A1B forcing scenario, with
data for 2007 (the hottest summer in Greece in the instrumental recordwith a record daily Tmax observed value of 44.8°C) indicates that thedistribution for 2007 is closer to the distribution for 2071-2100 than forthe 2021-2050 period, thus 2007 might be considered a ‘normal’ summerof the future (Founda and Giannakopoulos, 2009; Tolika et al., 2009).Beniston et al. (2007) concluded from an analysis of RCM output thatregions such as France and Hungary may experience as many days peryear above 30°C as currently experienced in Spain and Sicily. In thisRCM ensemble, France was the area with the largest projected warmingin the uppermost percentiles of daily summer temperatures althoughthe mean warming was greatest in the Mediterranean region (Fischerand Schär, 2009). New results from an RCM ensemble project increasesin the amplitude, frequency, and duration of health-impacting heat waves,especially in southern Europe (Fischer and Schär, 2010). Overall theseregional assessments are consistent with the global assessments providedabove. It should be noted, however, that the assessed uncertainty is largerat the regional level than at the continental or global level (see Box 3-2).Global-scale trends in a specific extreme may be either more reliable orless reliable than regional-scale trends, depending on the geographicaluniformity of the trends in the specific extreme (Section 3.1.6).Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment

Percentage of Days−28−14 0 14 28
Figure 3-4 | Projected annual and seasonal changes in three indices for daily Tmin for 2081-2100 with respect to 1980-1999, based on 14 GCMs  contributing to the CMIP3.
Left column: fraction of warm nights (days at which Tmin exceeds the 90th percentile of that day of the year, calculated from t he 1961-1990 reference period); middle column:
fraction of cold nights (days at which Tmin is lower than the 10th percentile of that day of the year, calculated from the 1961 -1990 reference period); right column: percentage of
days with Tmin >20°C. The changes are computed for the annual time scale (top row) and two seasons (December-January-February, DJF , middle row, and June-July-August, JJA,
bottom row) as the fractions/percentages in the 2081-2100 period (based on simulations under emission scenario SRES A2) minus t he fractions/percentages of the 1980-1999
period (from corresponding simulations for the 20th century). Warm night and cold night changes are expressed in units of stand ard deviations, derived from detrended per year
annual or seasonal estimates, respectively, from the three 20-year periods 1980-1999, 2046-2065, and 2081-2100 pooled together.  Tmin >20°C changes are given directly as
differences of percentage points. Color shading is only applied for areas where at least 66% (i.e., 10 out of 14) of the GCMs a gree in the sign of the change; stippling is applied
for regions where at least 90% (i.e.,13 out of 14) of the GCMs agree in the sign of the change. Adapted from Orlowsky and Senev iratne (2011); updating Tebaldi et al. (2006) for
additional number of indices and CMIP3 models, and including seasonal time frames. For more details, see Appendix 3.A.139Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical EnvironmentFull model rangeCentral 50%

maximum temperature computed using all land grid points. Adapted from the analysis of Kharin et al. (2007). For more details, s ee Appendix 3.A.141Temperature extremes were the type of extremes projected to change
with most confidence in the AR4 (IPCC, 2007a). This is confirmedregarding the sign of change with more recent analyses (Figures 3-3and 3-4), although there is a large spread with respect to the magnitudeof changes both due to emission scenario and climate model uncertainty(Figures 3-5a,b). If changes in temperature extremes scale with changesin mean temperature (i.e., simple shifts of the probability distribution),we infer that it is virtually certain that hot extremes will increase and
cold extremes will decrease over the 21st century with respect to the1960-1990 climate. Changes in the tails of the temperature distributionsmay not scale with changes in the mean in some regions (Section 3.1.6),though in most such reported cases hot extremes tend to increase andcold extremes decrease more than mean temperature, and thus theabove statement for extremes ( virtually certain increase in hot extremes
and decrease in cold extremes) still applies. Central and eastern Europeis a region where the evidence suggests that projected changes intemperature extremes result from both changes in the mean as well asfrom changes in the shape of the probability distributions (Schär et al.,2004). The main mechanism for the widening of the distribution islinked to the drying of the soil in this region (Sections 3.1.4 and 3.1.6).Furthermore, remote surface heating may induce circulation changesthat modify the temperature distribution (Haarsma et al., 2009). Otherlocal, mesoscale, and regional feedback mechanisms, in particular withland surface conditions (beside soil moisture, also with vegetation andsnow; Section 3.1.4) and aerosol concentrations (Ruckstuhl and Norris,2009) may enhance the uncertainties in temperature projections. Someof these processes occur at a small scale unresolved by the models(Section 3.2.3). In addition, lack of observational data (e.g., for soilmoisture and snow cover; see Section 3.2.1) reduces the possibilities toevaluate climate models (e.g., Roesch, 2006; Boe and Terray, 2008; Hallet al., 2008; Brown and Mote, 2009). Because of these various processesand associated uncertainties, mean global warming does not necessarilyimply warming in all regions and seasons (see also Section 3.1.6).Regarding mesoscale processes, lack of information also affectsconfidence in projections. One example is changes in heat waves in theMediterranean region that are suggested to have the largest impact incoastal areas, due to the role of enhanced relative humidity in healthimpacts (Diffenbaugh et al., 2007; Fischer and Schär, 2010). But it is notclear how this pattern may or may not be moderated by sea breezes(Diffenbaugh et al., 2007).
In summary, since 1950 it is very likely that there has been an
overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights and anoverall increase in the number of warm days and nights at the
global scale, that is, for land areas with sufficient data. It is likely
that such changes have also occurred at the continental scale in
North America, Europe, and Australia. There is medium confidence
in a warming trend in daily temperature extremes in much of Asia.Confidence in historical trends in daily temperature extremes in
Africa and South America generally varies from lowto medium
depending on the region. Globally, in many (but not all) regions
with sufficient data there is medium confidence that the length or
number of warm spells or heat waves has increased since themiddle of the 20th century. It is likely that anthropogenic
influences have led to warming of extreme daily minimum andmaximum temperatures at the global scale. Models projectsubstantial warming in temperature extremes by the end of the21st century. It is virtually certain that increases in the frequency
and magnitude of warm days and nights and decreases in the colddays and nights will occur through the 21st century at the globalscale. This is mostly linked with mean changes in temperatures,although changes in temperature variability can play an importantrole in some regions. It is very likely that the length, frequency,
and/or intensity of warm spells or heat waves (defined with
respect to present regional climate) will increase over most landareas. For the SRES A2 and A1B emission scenarios a 1-in-20 yearannual hottest day is likely to become a 1-in-2 year annual
extreme by the end of the 21st century in most regions, except inthe high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere where it is likely
to become a 1-in-5 year annual extreme. In terms of absolutevalues, 20-year extreme annual daily maximum temperature (i.e.,return value) will likely increase by about 1 to 3°C by mid-21st
century and by about 2 to 5°C by the late 21st century, dependingon the region and emissions scenario (Figure 3-5). Moderatetemperature extremes on land are projected to warm faster thanglobal annual mean temperature in many regions and seasons.Projected changes at subcontinental scales are less certain thanis the case for the global scale. Regional changes in temperatureextremes will differ from the mean global temperature change.Mean global warming does not necessarily imply warming in allregions and seasons.
3.3.2. Precipitation
This section addresses changes in daily extreme or heavy precipitationevents. Reductions in mean (or total) precipitation that can lead todrought (i.e., associated with lack of precipitation) are considered inSection 3.5.1. 
Because climates are so diverse across different parts of
the world, it is difficult to provide a single definition of extreme or heavyprecipitation. In general, two different approaches have been used:(1) relative thresholds such as percentiles (typically the 95th percentile)and return values; and (2) absolute thresholds [e.g., 50.8 mm (2 inches)day
-1of rain in the United States, and 100 mm day-1of rain in China].
For more details on the respective drawbacks and advantages of thesetwo approaches, see Section 3.1 and Box 3-1. 
Note that we do not
distinguish between rain and snowfall (both considered as contributorsto overall extreme precipitation events) as they are not treated sepa rately
in the literature, but do distinguish changes in hail from other precipitationtypes. Increases in public awareness and changes in reporting practiceshave led to inconsistencies in the record of severe thunderstorms andhail that make it difficult to detect trends in the intensity or frequencyof these events (Kunkel et al., 2008). Furthermore, weather events suchas hail are not well captured by current monitoring systems and, insome parts of the world, the monitoring network is very sparse (Section3.2.1), resulting in considerable uncertainty in the estimates of extremeChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment142precipitation. There are also known biases in precipitation measurements,
mostly leading to rain undercatch. Little evidence of paleoclimatic andhistorical changes in heavy precipitation is available to place recentvariations into context.
Observed Changes
The AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007) concluded that it was likely that there
had been increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g.,95th percentile) over the second half of the 20th century within manyland regions, even in those where there had been a reduction in total
precipitation amount, consistent with a warming climate and observed
significant increasing amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere.Increases had also been reported for rarer precipitation events (1-in-50year return period), but only a few regions had sufficient data to assesssuch trends reliably. However, the AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007) also statedthat “Many analyses indicate that the evolution of rainfall statisticsthrough the second half of the 20th century is dominated by variationson the interannual to inter-decadal time scale and that trend estimatesare spatially incoherent (Manton et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2002; Griffithset al., 2003; Herath and Ratnaya ke, 2004)”. Overall, as highlighted in
Alexander et al. (2006), the observed changes in precipitation extremeswere found at the time to be much less spatially coherent and statisticallysignificant compared to observed changes in temperature extremes:although statistically significant trends toward stronger precipitationextremes were generally found for a larger fraction of the land areathan trends toward weaker precipitation extremes, statistically signifi cant
changes in precipitation indices for the overall land areas with datawere only found for the Simple Daily Intensity index, and not for otherconsidered indices such as Heavy Rainfall Days (Alexander et al., 2006). 
Recent studies have updated the assessment of the AR4, with more
regional results now available (Table 3-2). Overall, this additional evi dence
confirms that more locations and studies show an increase than adecrease in extreme precipitation, but that there are also wide regionaland seasonal variations, and trends in many regions are not statisticallysignificant (Table 3-2).
Recent studies on past and current changes in precipitation extremes in
North America, some of which are included in the recent assessment of
the CCSP report (Kunkel et al., 2008), have reported an increasing trendover the last half century. Based on station data from Canada, the
United States, and Mexico, Peterson et al. (2008a) reported that heavy
precipitation has been increasing over 1950-2004, as well as the average
amount of precipitation falling on days with precipitation. For the
contiguous United States, DeGaetano (2009) showed a 20% reductionin the return period for extreme precipitation of different return levels
over 1950-2007; Gleason et al. (2008) reported an increasing trend inthe area experiencing a much above-normal proportion of heavy daily
precipitation from 1950 to 2006; and Pryor et al. (2009) provided evi dence
of increases in the intensity of events above the 95th percentile during
the 20th century, with a larger magnitude of the increase at the end of thecentury. The largest trends toward increased annual total precipitation,
number of rainy days, and intense precipitation (e.g., fraction derivedfrom events in excess of the 90th percentile value) were focused on theGreat Plains/northwestern Midwest (Pryor et al., 2009). In the core ofthe North American monsoon region in northwest Mexico, statisticallysignificant positive trends were found in daily precipitation intensityand seasonal contribution of daily precipitation greater than its 95thpercentile in the mountain sites for the period 1961-1998. However, nostatistically significant changes were found in coastal stations (Cavazoset al., 2008). Overall, the evidence indicates a likely increase in observed
heavy precipitation in many regions in North America, despite statisti cally
non-significant trends and some decreases in some subregions (Table 3-2).This general increase in heavy precipitation accompanies a generalincrease in total precipitation in most areas of the country.
There is low tomedium confidence in trends for Central and South
America, where spatially varying trends in extreme rainfall events havebeen observed (Table 3-2). Positive trends in many areas but negativetrends in some regions are evident for Central America and northernSouth America (Dufek and Ambrizzi, 2008; Marengo et al., 2009b; Reand Ricardo Barros, 2009; Sugahara et al., 2009). For the western coastof South America, a decrease in extreme rainfall in many areas and anincrease in a few areas are observed (Haylock et al., 2006b).
There is medium confidence in trends in heavy precipitation in Europe,
due to partly inconsistent signals across studies and regions, especiallyin summer (Table 3-2). Winter extreme precipitation has increased in partof the continent, in particular in central-western Europe and EuropeanRussia (Zolina et al., 2009), but the trend in summer precipitation hasbeen weak or not spatially coherent (Moberg et al., 2006; Bartholy andPongracz, 2007; Maraun et al., 2008; Pavan et al., 2008; Zolina et al.,2008; Costa and Soares, 2009; Kyselý, 2009; Durão et al., 2010; Roddaet al., 2010). Increasing trends in 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles of dailywinter precipitation over 1901-2000 were found (Moberg et al., 2006),which has been confirmed by more detailed country-based studies forthe United Kingdom (Maraun et al., 2008), Germany (Zolina et al.,2008), and central and eastern Europe (Bartholy and Pongracz, 2007;Kyselý, 2009), while decreasing trends have been found in some regionssuch as northern Italy (Pavan et al., 2008), Poland (Lupikasza, 2010),and some Mediterranean coastal sites (Toreti et al., 2010). Uncertaintiesare overall larger in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region,where there is low confidence in the trends (Table 3-2). A recent study
(Zolina et al., 2010) has indicated that there has been an increase ofabout 15 to 20% in the persistence of wet spells over most of Europeover the last 60 years, which was not associated with an increase of thetotal number of wet days.
There is low tomedium confidence in trends in heavy precipitation in
Asia, both at the continental and regional scale for most regions (Table3-2; see also Alexander et al., 2006). A weak increase in the frequencyof extreme precipitation events is observed in northern Mongolia(Nandintsetseg et al., 2007). No systematic spatially coherent trends inthe frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events have beenChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment143found in Eastern and Southeast Asia (Choi et al., 2009), central and
south Asia (Klein Tank et al., 2006), and Western Asia (X. Zhang et al.,2005; Rahimzadeh et al., 2009). However, statistically significant positiveand negative trends were observed at subregional scales within theseregions. Heavy precipitation increased in Japan during 1901-2004 (Fujibeet al., 2006), and in India (Rajeevan et al., 2008; Krishnamurthy et al.,2009) especially during the monsoon seasons (Sen Roy, 2009; Pattanaikand Rajeevan, 2010). Both statistically significant increases anddecreases in extreme precipitation have been found in China over theperiod 1951-2000 (Zhai et al., 2005) and 1978-2002 (Yao et al., 2008).In Peninsular Malaysia during 1971-2005 the intensity of extremeprecipitation increased and the frequency decreased, while the trend inthe proportion of extreme rainfall over total precipitation was notstatistically significant (Zin et al., 2009). Heavy precipitation increasedover the southern and northern Tibetan Plateau but decreased in thecentral Tibetan Plateau during 1961-2005 (You et al., 2008).
In southern Australia, there has been a likely decrease in heavy
precipitation in many areas, especially where mean precipitation hasdecreased (Table 3-2). There were statistically significant increases inthe proportion of annual/seasonal rainfall stemming from heavy raindays from 1911-2008 and 1957-2008 in northwest Australia (Gallantand Karoly, 2010). Extreme summer rainfall over the northwest of theSwan-Avon River basin in western Australia increased over 1950-2003while extreme winter rainfall over the southwest of the basin decreased(Aryal et al., 2009). In New Zealand, the trends are positive in the westernNorth and South Islands and negative in the east of the country (Mullanet al., 2008).
There is low tomedium confidence in regional trends in heavy
precipitation in Africa due to partial lack of literature and data, and dueto lack of consistency in reported patterns in some regions (Table 3-2).The AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007) reported an increase in heavyprecipitation over southern Africa, but this appears to depend on theregion and precipitation index examined (Kruger, 2006; New et al.,2006; Seleshi and Camberlin, 2006; Aguilar et al., 2009). Central Africaexhibited a decrease in heavy precipitation over the last half century(Aguilar et al., 2009); however, data coverage for large parts of the
region was poor. Precipitation from heavy events has decreased in
western central Africa, but with low spatial coherence (Aguilar et al.,
2009). Rainfall intensity averaged over southern and west Africa has
increased (New et al., 2006). There is a lack of literature on changes inheavy precipitation in East Africa (Table 3-2). Camberlin et al. (2009)analyzed changes in components of rainy seasons’ variability over the
time period 1958-1987 in this region, but did not specifically address
trends in heavy precipitation. There were decreasing trends in heavy
precipitation over parts of Ethiopia during the period 1965-2002(Seleshi and Camberlin, 2006).
Changes in hail occurrence are generally difficult to quantify because hail
occurrence is not well captured by monitoring systems and because ofhistorical data inhomogeneities. Sometimes, changes in environmentalconditions conducive to hail occurrence are used to infer changes in hailoccurrence. However, the atmospheric conditions are typically estimated
from reanalyses or from radiosonde data and the estimates are associatedwith high uncertainty. As a result, assessment of changes in hail frequencyis difficult. For severe thunderstorms in the region east of the RockyMountains in the United States, Brooks and Dotzek (2008) found strongvariability but no clear trend in the past 50 years. Cao (2008) identifieda robust upward trend in hail frequency over Ontario, Canada. Kunz etal. (2009) found that both hail damage days and convective instabilityincreased during 1974-2003 in a state in southwest Germany. Xie et al.(2008) identified no trend in the mean annual hail days in China from1960 to the early 1980s but a statistically significant decreasing trendafterwards.
Causes of Observed Changes
The observed changes in heavy precipitation appear to be consistentwith the expected response to anthropogenic forcing (increase due toenhanced moisture content in the atmosphere; see, e.g., Section 3.2.2.1)but a direct cause-and-effect relationship between changes in externalforcing and extreme precipitation had not been established at the timeof the AR4. As a result, the AR4 only concluded that it was more likely
than not that anthropogenic influence had contributed to a global trend
towards increases in the frequency of heavy precipitation events overthe second half of the 20th century (Hegerl et al., 2007).
New research since the AR4 provides more evidence of anthropogenic
influence on various aspects of the global hydrological cycle (Stott et al.,2010; see also Section 3.2.2), which is directly relevant to extremeprecipitation changes. In particular, an anthropogenic influence onatmospheric moisture content is detectable (Santer et al., 2007; Willettet al., 2007; see also Section 3.2.2). Wang and Zhang (2008) show thatwinter season maximum daily precipitation in North America appears tobe statistically significantly influenced by atmospheric moisture content,with an increase in moisture corresponding to an increase in maximumdaily precipitation. This behavior has also been seen in model projectionsof extreme winter precipitation under global warming (Gutowski et al.,2008b). Climate model projections suggest that the thermodynamicconstraint based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is a good predictorfor extreme precipitation changes in a warmer world in regions wherethe nature of the ambient flows change little (Pall et al., 2007). Thisindicates that the observed increase in extreme precipitation in manyregions is consistent with the expected extreme precipitation responseto anthropogenic influences. However, the thermodynamic constraintmay not be a good predictor in regions with circulation changes, such asmid- to higher latitudes (Meehl et al., 2005) and the tropics (Emori andBrown, 2005), and in arid regions. Additionally, changes in precipitationextremes with temperature also depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in thetemperature when precipitation extremes occur (O’Gorman andSchneider, 2009a,b; Sugiyama et al., 2010). This may explain why therehave not been increases in precipitation extremes everywhere, althougha low signal-to-noise ratio may also play a role. However, even inChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment144regions where the Clausius-Clapeyron constraint is not closely followed,
it still appears to be a better predictor for future changes in extremeprecipitation than the change in mean precipitation in climate modelprojections (Pall et al., 2007). An observational study seems also to sup port
this thermodynamic theory. Analysis of daily precipitation from theSpecial Sensor Microwave Imager over the tropical oceans shows a
direct link between rainfall extremes and temperature: heavy rainfall
events increase during warm periods (El Niño) and decrease during coldperiods (Allan and Soden, 2008). However, the observed amplificationof rainfall extremes is larger than that predicted by climate models
(Allan and Soden, 2008), due possibly to widely varying changes in
upward velocities associated with precipitation extremes (O’Gorman
and Schneider, 2008). Evidence from measurements in the Netherlands
suggests that hourly precipitation extremes may in some cases increase
14% per degree of warming, which is twice as fast as what would be
expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship alone (Lenderink
and Van Meijgaard, 2008), though this is still under debate (Haerter andBerg, 2009; Lenderink and van Meijgaard, 2009). A comparison between
observed and multi-model simulated extreme precipitation using anoptimal detection method suggests that the human-induced increase in
greenhouse gases has contributed to the observed intensification ofheavy precipitation events over large Northern Hemisphere land areas
during the latter half of the 20th century (Min et al., 2011). Pall et al.(2011) linked human influence on global warming patterns with anincreased risk of England and Wales flooding in autumn (September-November) 2000 that is associated with a displacement in the NorthAtlantic jet stream. The present assessment based on evidence from newstudies and those used in the AR4 is that there is medium confidence
that anthropogenic influence has contributed to changes in extremeprecipitation at the global scale. However, this conclusion may bedependent on the season and spatial scale. For example, there is nowabout a 50% chance that an anthropogenic influence can be detectedin UK extreme precipitation in winter, but the likelihood of the detectionin other seasons is very small (Fowler and Wilby, 2010).
Projected Changes and Uncertainties
Regarding projected changes in extreme precipitation, the AR4 concludedthat it was very likely that heavy precipitation events, that is, the
frequency of heavy precipitation or proportion of total precipitationfrom heavy precipitation, would increase over most areas of the globeChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment

Figure 3-6 | Projected annual and seasonal changes in three indices for daily precipitation (Pr) for 2081-2100 with respect to 1980-1999, ba sed on 17 GCMs contributing to the
CMIP3. Left column: wet-day intensity; middle column: percentage of days with precipitation above the 95% quantile of daily wet  day precipitation for that day of the year,
calculated from the 1961-1990 reference period; right column: fraction of days with precipitation higher than 10 mm. The change s are computed for the annual time scale (top row)
and two seasons (DJF , middle row, and JJA, bottom row) as the fractions/percentages in the 2081-2100 period (based on simulatio ns under emission scenario SRES A2) minus the
fractions/percentages of the 1980-1999 period (from corresponding simulations for the 20th century). Changes in wet-day intensi ty and in the fraction of days with Pr >10 mm
are expressed in units of standard deviations, derived from detrended per year annual or seasonal estimates, respectively, from  the three 20-year periods 1980-1999, 2046-2065,
and 2081-2100 pooled together. Changes in percentages of days with precipitation above the 95% quantile are given directly as d ifferences in percentage points. Color shading is
only applied for areas where at least 66% (i.e., 12 out of 17) of the GCMs agree on the sign of the change; stippling is applie d for regions where at least 90% (i.e., 16 out of 17)
of the GCMs agree on the sign of the change. Adapted from Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011); updating Tebaldi et al. (2006) for a dditional number of indices and CMIP3 models,
and including seasonal time frames. For more details, see Appendix 3.A.145Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical EnvironmentFull model rangeCentral 50%

Figure 3-7b | Projected return period (in years) of late 20th century 20-year return values of annual maximum 24-hour precipitation rates. Th e bar plots (see legend for more information) show results for regionally averaged projections
for two time horizons, 2046 to 2065 and 2081 to 2100, as compared to the late 20th century (1981-2000), and for three different  SRES emission scenarios (B1, A1B, A2). Results are based on 14 GCMs contributing to the CMIP3. See
Figure 3-1 for defined extent of regions. The ‘Globe’ analysis (inset box) displays the projected return period (in years) of l ate 20th-century 20-year return values of annual maximum 24-hour precipitation rates computed using all land
grid points. Adapted from the analysis of Kharin et al. (2007). For more details, see Appendix 3.A.147in the 21st century (IPCC, 2007a). The tendency for an increase in heavy
daily precipitation events was found in many regions, including someregions in which the total precipitation was projected to decrease. 
Post-AR4 analyses of climate model simulations partly confirm this
assessment but also highlight fairly large uncertainties and model biasesin projections of changes in heavy precipitation in some regions(Section 3.2.3 and Table 3-3). On the other hand, more GCM and RCMensembles have now been analyzed for some regions (Table 3-3; seealso, e.g., Kharin et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010). At the time of the AR4,Tebaldi et al. (2006) was the main global study available on projectedchanges in precipitation extremes (e.g., Figure 10.18 of Meehl et al.,2007b). Orlowsky and Seneviratne (2011) extended this analysis to alarger number of GCMs from the CMIP3 ensemble and for seasonal inaddition to annual time frames (see also Section 3.3.1). Figure 3-6 pro vides
corresponding analyses of projected annual and seasonal changes ofthe wet-day intensity, the fraction of days with precipitation above the95% quantile of daily wet-day precipitation, and the fraction of dayswith precipitation above 10 mm day
-1. It should be noted that the
10 mm day-1threshold cannot be considered extreme in several regions,
but highlights differences in projections for absolute and relativethresholds (see also discussion in Box 3-1 and beginning of this section).
Figure 3-6 indicates that regions with model agreement (at least 66%)with respect to changes in heavy precipitation are mostly found in thehigh latitudes and in the tropics, and in some mid-latitude regions of theNorthern Hemisphere in the boreal winter. Regions with at least 90%model agreement are even more limited and confined to the highlatitudes. Overall, model agreement in projected changes is found to bestronger in boreal winter (DJF) than summer (JJA) for most regions.Kharin et al. (2007) analyzed changes in annual maxima of 24-hourprecipitation in the outputs of 14 CMIP3 models. Figure 3-7a displaysthe projected percentage change in the annual maximum of the 24-hourprecipitation rate from the late 20th-century 20-year return values,while Figure 3-7b displays the corresponding projected return periodsfor late 20th-century 20-year return values of the annual maximum24-hour precipitation rates in the mid-21st century (left) and in late 21stcentury (right) under three different emission scenarios (SRES B1, A1B,and A2). Between the late 20th and the late 21st century, the projected
responses of extreme precipitation to future emissions show increased
precipitation rates in most regions, and decreases in return periods inmost regions in the high latitudes and the tropics and in some regions
in the mid-latitudes consistent with projected changes in several indices
related to heavy precipitation (see Figure 3-6 and Tebaldi et al., 2006),
although there are increases in return periods or only small changes
projected in several regions. Except for these regions, the return period
for an event of annual maximum 24-hour precipitation with a 20-year
return period in the late 20th century is projected to be about 5 to 15
years by the end of the 21st century. The greatest projected reductionsin return period are in high latitudes and some tropical regions. The
stronger CO
2emissions scenarios (A1B and A2) lead to greater projected
decreases in return period. In some regions with projected decreases intotal precipitation (Christensen et al., 2007) such as southern Africa,west Asia, and the west coast of South America, heavy precipitation isnevertheless projected to increase (Figure 3-7, Table 3-3). In some other
areas with projected decreases in total precipitation (e.g., Central Americaand northern South America), however, heavy precipitation is projectedto decrease or not change. It should be noted that Figure 3-7 addressesvery extreme heavy precipitation events (those expected to occur aboutonce in 20 years) whereas Figure 3-6 addresses less extreme, but still
heavy, precipitation events. Projections of changes for these differentlydefined extreme events may differ. 
Future precipitation projected by the CMIP3 models has also been
analyzed in a number of studies for various regions using differentcombinations of the models (see next paragraphs and Table 3-3). Ingeneral these studies confirm the findings of global-scale studies byTebaldi et al. (2006) and Kharin et al. (2007).
By analyzing simulations with a single GCM, Khon et al. (2007) reported
a projected general increase in extreme precipitation for the differentregions in northern Eurasia especially for winter. Su et al. (2009) foundthat for the Yangtze River Basin region in 2001-2050, the 50-year heavyprecipitation events become more frequent, with return periods fallingto below 25 years (relative to 1951-2000 behavior). For the Indianregion, the Hadley Centre coupled model HadCM3 projects increases inthe magnitude of the heaviest rainfall with a doubling of atmosphericCO
2concentration (Turner and Slingo, 2009). Simulations by 12 GCMs
projected an increase in heavy precipitation intensity and meanprecipitation rates in east Africa, more severe precipitation deficits inthe southwest of southern Africa, and enhanced precipitation furthernorth in Zambia, Malawi, and northern Mozambique (Shongwe et al.,2009, 2011). Rocha et al. (2008) evaluated differences in the precipitationregime over southeastern Africa simulated by two GCMs underpresent (1961-1990) and future (2071-2100) conditions as a result ofanthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing. They found that the intensity ofall episode categories of precipitation events is projected to increasepractically over the whole region, whereas the number of episodes isprojected to decrease in most of the region and for most episodecategories. Extreme precipitation is projected to increase over Australia in2080-2099 relative to 1980-1999 in an analysis of the CMIP3 ensemble,although there are inconsistencies between projections from differentmodels (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009). 
High spatial resolution is important for studies of extreme precipitation
because the physical processes responsible for extreme precipitationrequire high spatial resolution to resolve them (e.g., Kim et al., 2010).Post-AR4 studies have employed three approaches to obtain high spatialresolution to project precipitation extremes: high-resolution GCMs,dynamical downscaling using RCMs, and statistical downscaling (seealso Section 3.2.3.1). Based on the Meteorological Research Instituteand Japan Meteorological Agency 20-km horizontal grid GCM, heavyprecipitation was projected to increase substantially in south Asia, theAmazon, and west Africa, with increased dry spell persistence projectedin South Africa, southern Australia, and the Amazon at the end of the21st century (Kamiguchi et al., 2006). In the Asian monsoon region,heavy precipitation was projected to increase, notably in BangladeshChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment148and in the Yangtze River basin due to the intensified convergence of
water vapor flux in summer. Using statistical downscaling, Wang andZhang (2008) investigated possible changes in North American extremeprecipitation probability during winter from 1949-1999 to 2050-2099.Downscaled results suggested a strong increase in extreme precipitationover the south and central United States but decreases over theCanadian prairies. Projected European precipitation extremes in high-resolution studies tend to increase in northern Europe (Frei et al., 2006;Beniston et al., 2007; Schmidli et al., 2007), especially during winter(Haugen and Iversen, 2008; May, 2008), as also highlighted in Table 3-3.Fowler and Ekström (2009) project increases in both short-duration(1-day) and longer-duration (10-day) precipitation extremes across theUnited Kingdom during winter, spring, and autumn. In summer, modelprojections for the United Kingdom span the zero change line, althoughthere is low confidence due to poor model performance in this season.
Using daily statistics from various models, Boberg et al. (2009a,b)projected a clear increase in the contribution to total precipitation frommore intense events together with a decrease in the number of dayswith light precipitation. This pattern of change was found to be robustfor all European subregions. In double-nested model simulations with ahorizontal grid spacing of 10 km, Tomassini and Jacob (2009) projectedpositive trends in extreme quantiles of heavy precipitation overGermany, although they are relatively small except for the high-CO
2A2
emission scenario. For the Upper Mississippi River Basin region duringOctober through March, the intensity of extreme precipitation is projectedto increase (Gutowski et al., 2008b). Simulations with a single RCMproject an increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation events overmost of southeastern South America and western Amazonia in 2071-2100,whereas in northeast Brazil and eastern Amazonia smaller or nochanges are projected (Marengo et al., 2009a). Outputs from anotherRCM indicate an increase in the magnitude of future extreme rainfallevents in the Westernport region of Australia, consistent with resultsbased on the CMIP3 ensemble (Alexander and Arblaster, 2009), and thesize of this increase is greater in 2070 than in 2030 (Abbs and Rafter,2008). When both future land use changes and increasing greenhousegas concentrations are considered in the simulations, tropical andnorthern Africa are projected to experience less extreme rainfall eventsby 2025 during most seasons except for autumn (Paeth and Thamm,2007). Simulations with high-resolution RCMs projected that thefrequency of extreme precipitation increases in the warm climate for
June through to September in Japan (Nakamura et al., 2008; Wakazuki
et al., 2008; Kitoh et al., 2009). An increase in 90th-percentile values of
daily precipitation on the Pacific side of the Japanese islands during July
in the future climate was projected with a 5-km mesh cloud-system-
resolving non-hydrostatic RCM (Kanada et al., 2010b).
Post-AR4 studies indicate that the projection of precipitation extremes
is associated with large uncertainties, contributed by the uncertainties
related to GCMs, RCMs, and statistical downscaling methods, and by
natural variability of the climate. Kyselý and Beranova (2009) examined
scenarios of change in extreme precipitation events in 24 future climate
runs of 10 RCMs driven by two GCMs, focusing on a specific area ofcentral Europe with complex orography. They demonstrated that theinter- and intra-model variability and related uncertainties in the pattern
and magnitude of the change are large, although they also show thatthe projected trends tend to agree with those recently observed in thearea, which may strengthen their credibility. May (2008) reported anunrealistically large projected precipitation change over the Baltic Seain summer in an RCM, apparently related to an unrealistic projection ofBaltic Sea warming in the driving GCM. Frei et al. (2006) found largemodel differences in summer when RCM formulation contributessignificantly to scenario uncertainty. In exploring the ability of twostatistical downscaling models to reproduce the direction of the projectedchanges in indices of precipitation extremes, Hundecha and Bardossy(2008) concluded that the statistical downscaling models seem to bemore reliable during seasons when local climate is determined by large-scale circulation than by local convective processes. Themeßl et al.(2011) merged linear and nonlinear empirical-statistical downscalingtechniques with bias correction methods, and demonstrated theirability to drastically reduce RCM error characteristics. The extent to whichthe natural variability of the climate affects our ability to project theanthropogenically forced component of changes in daily precipitationextremes was investigated by Kendon et al. (2008). They show thatannual to multidecadal natural variability across Europe may contribute tosubstantial uncertainty. Also, Kiktev et al. (2009) performed an objectivecomparison of climatologies and historical trends of temperature andprecipitation extremes using observations and 20th-century climatesimulations. They did not detect significant similarity between simulatedand actual patterns of the indices of precipitation extremes in most cases.Moreover, Allan and Soden (2008) used satellite observations and modelsimulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events tonaturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmosphericmoisture content. The observed amplification of rainfall extremes waslarger than that predicted by models. The underestimation of rainfallextremes by the models may be related to the coarse spatial resolutionused in the model simulations – the magnitude of changes in precipitationextremes depends on spatial resolution (Kitoh et al., 2009) – suggestingthat projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response toanthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.
Confidence is still lowfor hail projections particularly due to a lack of
hail-specific modelling studies, and a lack of agreement among the fewavailable studies. There is little information in the AR4 regarding projectedchanges in hail events, and there has been little new literature since theAR4. Leslie et al. (2008) used coupled climate model simulations underthe SRES A1B scenario to estimate future changes in hailstorms in theSydney Basin, Australia. Their future climate simulations show anincrease in the frequency and intensity of hailstorms out to 2050, andthey suggest that the increase will emerge from the natural backgroundvariability within just a few decades. This result offers a differentconclusion from the modelling study of Niall and Walsh (2005), whichsimulated Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) for southeasternAustralia in an environment containing double the pre-industrialconcentrations of equivalent CO
2. They found a statistically significant
projected decrease in CAPE values and concluded that “it is possiblethat there will be a decrease in the frequency of hail in southeasternChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment149Australia if current rates of CO2emission are sustained,” assuming the
strong relationship between hail incidence and the CAPE for 1980-2001remains unchanged under enhanced greenhouse conditions.
In summary, it is likely that there have been statistically signifi cant
increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g., 95thpercentile) in more regions than there have been statisticallysignificant decreases, but there are strong regional and subregionalvariations in the trends (i.e., both between and within regionsconsidered in this report; Figure 3-1 and Tables 3-2 and 3-3). Inparticular, many regions present statistically non-significant ornegative trends, and, where seasonal changes have beenassessed, there are also variations between seasons (e.g., moreconsistent trends in winter than in summer in Europe). The overallmost consistent trends toward heavier precipitation events arefound in North America ( likely increase over the continent). There
is low confidence in observed trends in phenomena such as hail
because of historical data inhomogeneities and inadequacies inmonitoring systems. Based on evidence from new studies and thoseused in the AR4, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic
influence has contributed to intensification of extreme precipita tion
at the global scale. There is almost no literature on the attributionof changes in hail extremes, thus no assessment can be providedfor these at this point in time. Projected changes from both globaland regional studies indicate that it is likely that the frequency
of heavy precipitation or proportion of total rainfall from heavyfalls will increase in the 21st century over many areas on theglobe, especially in the high latitudes and tropical regions, andnorthern mid-latitudes in winter. Heavy precipitation is projectedto increase in some (but not all) regions with projected decreasesof total precipitation ( medium confidence ). For a range of emission
scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1), projections indicate that it is likely that
a 1-in-20 year annual maximum 24-hour precipitation rate willbecome a 1-in-5 to -15 year event by the end of 21st century in manyregions. Nevertheless, increases or statistically non-significantchanges in return periods are projected in some regions.
3.3.3. Wind
Extreme wind speeds pose a threat to human safety, maritime and
aviation activities, and the integrity of infrastructure. As well as extreme
wind speeds, other attributes of wind can cause extreme impacts. Trendsin average wind speed can influence potential evaporation and in turnwater availability and droughts (e.g., McVicar et al., 2008; see alsoSection 3.5.1 and Box 3-3). Sustained mid-latitude winds can elevatecoastal sea levels (e.g., McInnes et al., 2009b), while longer-term
changes in prevailing wind direction can cause changes in wave climateand coastline stability (Pirazzoli and Tomasin, 2003; see also Sections3.5.4 and 3.5.5). Aeolian processes exert significant influence on the
formation and evolution of arid and semi-arid environments, being
strongly linked to soil and vegetation change (Okin et al., 2006). A rapidshift in wind direction may reposition the leading edge of a forest fire(see Section 4.2.2.2; Mills, 2005) while the fire itself may generate a
local circulation response such as tornado genesis (e.g., Cunninghamand Reeder, 2009). Unlike other weather and climate elements such astemperature and rainfall, extreme winds are often considered in thecontext of the extreme phenomena with which they are associated suchas tropical and extratropical cyclones (see also Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5),thunderstorm downbursts, and tornadoes. Although wind is often notused to define the extreme event itself (Peterson et al., 2008b), windspeed thresholds may be used to characterize the severity of thephenomenon (e.g., the Saffir-Simpson scale for tropical cyclones).Changes in wind extremes may arise from changes in the intensity orlocation of their associated phenomena (e.g., a change in local convectiveactivity) or from other changes in the climate system such as themovement of large-scale circulation patterns. Wind extremes may bedefined by a range of quantities such as high percentiles, maxima overa particular time scale (e.g., daily to yearly), or storm-related highestvalues. Wind gusts, which are a measure of the highest winds in a shorttime interval (typically 3 seconds), may be evaluated in models usinggust parameterizations that are applied to the maximum daily near-surface wind speed (e.g., Rockel and Woth, 2007).
Over paleoclimatic time scales, proxy data have been used to infer
circulation changes across the globe from the mid-Holocene (~6000 yearsago) to the beginning of the industrial revolution (Wanner et al., 2008).Over this period, there is evidence for changes in circulation patternsacross the globe. The Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) movedsouthward, leading to weaker monsoons across Asia (Haug et al., 2001).The Walker circulation strengthened and Southern Ocean westerliesmoved northward and strengthened, affecting southern Australia, NewZealand, and southern South America (Shulmeister et al., 2006; Wanneret al., 2008), and an increase in ENSO variability and frequency occurred(Rein et al., 2005; Wanner et al., 2008). There is also weaker evidence fora change toward a lower Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), implyingweaker westerly winds over the north Atlantic (Wanner et al., 2008).While the changes in the Northern Hemisphere were attributed tochanges in orbital forcing, those in the Southern Hemisphere were morecomplex, possibly reflecting the additional role on circulation of heattransport in the ocean. Solar variability and volcanic eruptions may alsohave contributed to decadal to multi-centennial fluctuations over thistime period (Wanner et al., 2008).
The AR4 did not specifically address changes in extreme wind although
it did report on wind changes in the context of other phenomena such astropical and extratropical cyclones and oceanic waves and concluded thatmid-latitude westerlies had increased in strength in both hemispheres(Trenberth et al., 2007). Direct investigation of changes in windclimatology has been hampered by the sparseness of long-term, high-quality wind measurements from terrestrial anemometers arising from theinfluence of changes in instrumentation, station location, and surroundingland use (e.g., Cherry, 1988; Pryor et al., 2007; Jakob, 2010; see alsoSection 3.2.1). Nevertheless, a number of recent studies report trends inmean and extreme wind speeds in different parts of the world based onwind observations and reanalyses.Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment150Over North America, a declining trend in 50th and 90th percentile wind
speeds has been reported for much of the United States over 1973 to2005 (Pryor et al., 2007) and in 10-m hourly wind data over 1953-2006over western and most of southern Canada (Wan et al., 2010). Anincreasing trend has been reported in average winds over Alaska over1955-2001 by Lynch et al. (2004) and over the central Canadian Arcticin all seasons and in the Maritimes in spring and autumn by Wan et al.(2010) as well as in annual maximum winds in a regional reanalysisover the southern Maritimes from 1979-2003 (Hundecha et al., 2008).Over China, negative trends have been reported in 10-m monthly meanand 95th percentile winds over 1969-2005 (Guo et al., 2011), in dailymaximum wind speeds over 1956-2004 by Jiang et al. (2010a), and in2-m average winds over the Tibetan plateau from 1966-2003 (Y . Zhanget al., 2007), confirming earlier declining trends in mean and strong10-m winds reported by Xu et al. (2006). Over Europe, Smits et al. (2005)found declining trends in extreme winds (those occurring on average10 and 2 times per year) in 10-m anemometer data over 1962-2002.Pirazolli and Tomasin (2003) reported a generally declining trend inboth annual mean and annual maximum winds from 1951 to the mid-1970s and an increasing trend since then, from observations in thecentral Mediterranean region. Similar to the mostly declining trendsfound in Northern Hemisphere studies of surface wind observations,Vautard et al. (2010) also found mostly declining trends in surface windobservations across the continental northern mid-latitudes and astronger decline in extreme winds compared to mean winds in surfacewind measurements. In the Southern Hemisphere, McVicar et al. (2008)reported declines in 2-m mean wind speed over 88% of Australia(significant over 57% of the country) over 1975-2006 and positive trendsover about 12% of the mainland interior and southern and easterncoastal regions including Tasmania. In Antarctica, increasing trends inmean wind speeds have been reported over the second half of the 20thcentury (Turner et al., 2005). With the exception of the robust declines inwind reported over China, studies in most areas are too few in numberto draw robust conclusions on wind speed change and even fewerstudies have addressed extreme wind change. Some studies reportopposite trends between anemometer winds and reanalysis data sets insome areas (Smits et al., 2005; McVicar et al., 2008; Vautard et al., 2010);however, comparisons of surface anemometer data at 10 m or lower
with reanalysis-derived 10-m data that do not resolve complex surfacefeatures is problematic. 
Trends in extreme winds have also been inferred from trends in partic ular
phenomena. With regards to tropical cyclones (Section 3.4.4.), nostatistically significant trends have been detected in the overall global
annual number although a trend has been reported in the intensity of
the strongest storms since 1980 [but there is low confidence that any
observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone
activity are robust, after accounting for past changes in observing
capabilities; see Section 3.4.4]. In the mid-latitudes, studies have used
proxies for wind such as pressure tendencies or geostrophic windscalculated from triangles of pressure (geo-winds) over Europe (e.g.,
Barring and von Storch, 2004; Matulla et al., 2008; Allan et al., 2009;
Barring and Fortuniak, 2009; X.L. Wang et al., 2009b) and Australia (e.g.,Alexander and Power, 2009; Alexander et al., 2011). For Europe, these
studies suggest that storm activity was higher around 1900 and in the1990s and lower in the 1960s and 1970s, although X.L. Wang et al.(2009b) note that seasonal trends behave differently than annual trends.In general, long-term trends differ between the different availablestudies as well as studies that focus on the period for which reanalysisdata exist (e.g., Raible, 2007; Leckebusch et al., 2008; Della-Marta et al.,2009; Nissen et al., 2010), and strong inter-decadal variability is alsooften reported (e.g., Allan et al., 2009; X.L. Wang et al., 2009b; Nissen etal., 2010). Over southeast Australia, a decline in storm activity sincearound 1885 has been reported (Alexander and Power, 2009; Alexander etal., 2011). See Section 3.4.5 for more discussion of extratropical cyclones.Regarding other phenomena associated with extreme winds, such asthunderstorms, tornadoes, and mesoscale convective complexes, studiesare too few in number to assess the effect of their changes on extremewinds. As well, historical data inhomogeneities mean that there is low
confidence in any observed trends in these small-scale phenomena.
The AR4 reported for the mid-latitudes that trends in the Northern and
Southern Annular Modes, which correspond to sea level pressure reductionsover the poles, are likely related in part to human activity, and this in
turn has affected storm tracks and wind patterns in both hemispheres(Hegerl et al., 2007). The relationship between mean and severe windsand natural modes of variability has been investigated in several post-AR4 studies. On the Canadian west coast, Abeysirigunawardena et al.(2009) found that higher extreme winds tend to occur during the nega tive
(i.e., cold) ENSO phase. The generally increasing trend in mean windspeeds over recent decades in Antarctica is consistent with the changein the nature of the Southern Annular Mode toward its high index state(Turner et al., 2005). Donat et al. (2010b) concluded that 80% of stormdays in central Europe are connected with westerly flows that occurprimarily during the positive phase of the NAO. Declining trends in windover China have mainly been linked to circulation changes due to aweaker land-sea thermal contrast (Xu et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2010a;Guo et al., 2011). Vautard et al. (2010) attribute the slowdown in mid tohigh percentiles of surface winds over most of the continental northernmid-latitudes to changes in atmospheric circulation (10-50%) and anincrease in surface roughness due to biomass increases (25-60%),which are supported by RCM simulations. X.L. Wang et al. (2009a)formally detected a link between external forcing and positive trends inthe high northern latitudes and negative trends in the northern mid-latitudes using a proxy for wind (geostrophic wind energy) in the borealwinter. Trends in mean and annual maximum winds in the centralMediterranean region were found to be positively correlated withtemperature but not with the NAO index (Pirazzoli and Tomasin, 2003).Nissen et al. (2010) used cyclone tracking to identify associated strongwinds in reanalysis data from 1957 to 2002 and found a positive trendin the central Mediterranean region and southern Europe and a negativetrend over the western Mediterranean region.
Projections of wind speed changes and particularly wind extremes
were not specifically addressed in the AR4 although references to windspeed were made in relation to other variables and phenomena such as
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment151mid-latitude storm tracks, tropical cyclones, and ocean waves
(Christensen et al., 2007; Meehl et al., 2007b). Meehl et al. (2007b)projected a likely increase in tropical cyclone extreme winds in the
future and provided more evidence for a projected poleward shift of thestorm tracks and associated changes in wind patterns. Since the AR4,new studies have focused on future changes in winds. Gastineau andSoden (2009) reported a decrease in 99th-percentile winds at 850 hPain the tropics and an increase in the extratropics in a 17-member multi-model ensemble over 2081-2100 relative to 1981-2000. McInnes et al.(2011) presented spatial maps of multi-model agreement in mean and
99th-percentile 10-m wind change between 1981-2000 and 2081-2100in a 19-member ensemble (see Figure 3-8). These show an increase inmean winds over Europe, parts of Central and North America, the tropicalSouth Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. Mean wind speed declines occur
along the equator reflecting a slowdown in the Walker circulation
(Collins et al., 2010) (and in the vicinity of the subtropical ridge in bothhemispheres which, together with the strengthening of winds further
poleward, reflect the contraction toward the poles of the mid-latitude
storm tracks; see Section 3.4.5). Seasonal differences are also apparent
with more extensive mean wind increases in the Arctic and parts of the
northern Pacific in DJF and decreases over most of the northern Pacific
in JJA. The 99th-percentile wind changes show declines over most oceanareas except the northern Pacific and Arctic and Southern Ocean south
of 40°S in DJF , the south Pacific between about 10 and 25°S in JJA, and
the Southern Ocean south of 50°S in JJA. Increases in 99th-percentilewinds occur over the Arctic and large parts of the continental area in the
Northern Hemisphere in DJF and in Africa, northern Australia, andCentral and South America in JJA. Despite the projections displayed inFigure 3-8, the relatively few studies of projected extreme winds,combined with shortcomings in the simulation of extreme winds andthe different models, regions, and methods used to develop projectionsof this quantity, means that we have low confidence in projections of
changes in strong winds.
Regional increases in winter wind storm risk over Europe due to
changes in storm tracks are also supported by a number of regionalstudies (e.g., Pinto et al., 2007b; Debernard and Roed, 2008; Leckebuschet al., 2008; Sterl et al., 2009; Donat et al., 2010a,b, 2011). However, GCMsat their current resolution are unable to resolve small-scale phenomenasuch as tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and mesoscale convective complexesthat are associated with particularly severe winds, although as noted byMcInnes et al. (2011) these winds would typically be more extreme than99th percentile. There is evidence to suggest an increase in extremewinds from tropical cyclones in the future (see Section 3.4.4). Anincrease in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations may causesome of the atmospheric conditions conducive to tornadoes  such asatmospheric instability to increase due to increasing temperature andhumidity, while others  such as  vertical shear to decrease  due to  areduced  pole-to-equator temperature gradient (Diffenbaugh et al.,2008), but the literature on these phenomena is extremely limited atChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment

areas where more than 66% of models agree on a small change between ±2%. Adapted from McInnes et al. (2011); for more details s ee Appendix 3.A.152this time. There is thus low confidence in projections of changes in such
small-scale systems because of limited studies, inability of climate modelsto resolve these phenomena, and possible competing factors affectingfuture changes. Confidence in the extreme wind changes is thereforelower in the regions most influenced by these phenomena irrespectiveof whether there is high agreement between GCMs on the sign of thewind speed change.
In addition to studies using GCMs there have also been several recent
studies employing RCMs. Those focusing on Europe (e.g., Beniston et al.,2007; Rockel and Woth, 2007; Haugen and Iversen, 2008; Rauthe et al.,2010) also provide a general picture of an increasing trend in extremewinds over northern Europe despite a range of different downscalingmodels used, the different GCMs in which the downscaling is undertaken,and different metrics used to quantify extreme winds. Small-scale polarlows that typically form north of 60°N have been found to decline infrequency in RCM simulations downscaled from a GCM under differentemission scenarios and this is related to greater stability over the regiondue to mid-troposphere temperatures warming faster than sea surfacetemperatures over the region (Zahn and von Storch, 2010). In other partsof the world there have been very few studies. Over China, Jiang et al.(2010b) projected decreases in annual and winter mean wind speedbased on two RCMs that downscale two different GCMs. Over NorthAmerica, statistical downscaling of winds from four GCMs over fiveairports in the northwest United States indicated declines in summerwind speeds and less certain changes in winter (Sailor et al., 2008).
A number of recent studies have addressed observed changes in
wind speed across different parts of the globe, but due to thevarious shortcomings associated with anemometer data and theinconsistency in anemometer and reanalysis trends in some regions,we have low confidence in wind trends and their causes at this
stage. We also have low confidence in how the observed trends in
mean wind speed relate to trends in extreme winds. The fewstudies of projected extreme winds, combined with shortcomingsin the simulation of extreme winds and the different models,regions, and methods used to develop projections of this quantity,mean that we have low confidence in projections of changes in
extreme winds (with the exception of changes associated with
tropical cyclones; Section 3.4.4). There is low confidence in
projections of small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes
because competing physical processes may affect future trends
and because climate models do not simulate such phenomena.
3.4. Observed and Projected Changes in
Phenomena Related to Weather andClimate Extremes
3.4.1. Monsoons
Changes in monsoon-related extreme precipitation and winds due to
climate change are not well understood. Generally, precipitation is themost important variable, but it is also a variable associated with larger
uncertainties in climate simulations and projections (Wang et al., 2005;Kang and Shukla, 2006). Changes in monsoons should be better depictedby large-scale dynamics, circulation, or moisture convergence morebroadly than via precipitation only. However, few studies have focusedon observed changes in the large-scale and regional monsoon circulations.Hence, in this section, we focus mostly on monsoon-induced changesin total and seasonal rainfall, with most discussions of intense rainfallcovered in Section 3.3.2.
Modeling experiments to assess paleo-monsoons suggest that in the
past, during the Holocene due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale, there was a progressive southward shift of the NorthernHemisphere summer position of the ITCZ around 8,000 years ago. Thiswas accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon rainfallsystems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness on both continents,while in South America the monsoon was weaker and drier than in thepresent, as suggested both by models and paleoclimatic indicators(Wanner et al., 2008).
The delineation of the global monsoon has been mostly performed
using rainfall data or outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) fields (Kim etal., 2008). Lau and Wu (2007) identified two opposite time evolutions inthe occurrence of rainfall events in the tropics: a negative trend inmoderate rain events and a positive trend in heavy and light rainevents. Positive trends in intense rain were located in deep convectivecores of the ITCZ, South Pacific Convergence Zone, Indian Ocean, andmonsoon regions.
In the Indo-Pacific region, covering the southeast Asian and north
Australian monsoon, Caesar et al. (2011) found low spatial coherence intrends in precipitation extremes across the region between 1971 and2003. In the few cases where statistically significant trends in precipitationextremes were identified, there was generally a trend towards wetterconditions, in common with the global results of Alexander et al. (2006).Liu et al. (2011) reported a decline in recorded precipitation events inChina over 1960-2000, which was mainly accounted for by a decreasein light precipitation events, with intensities of 0.1-0.3 mm day
-1. Some
of the extreme precipitation appeared to be positively correlated with aLa Niña-like sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, but withoutsuggesting the presence of a trend. With regard to wind changes, Guoet al. (2011) analyzed near-surface wind speed change in China and itsmonsoon regions from 1969 to 2005 and showed a statistically significantweakening in annual and seasonal mean wind. 
For the Indian monsoon, Rajeevan et al. (2008) showed that extreme
rain events have an increasing trend between 1901 and 2005, but thetrend is much stronger after 1950. Sen Roy (2009) investigated changesin extreme hourly rainfall in India, and found widespread increases inheavy precipitation events across India, mostly in the high-elevationregions of the northwestern Himalaya as well as along the foothills of theHimalaya extending south into the Indo-Ganges basin, and particularlyduring the summer monsoon season during 1980-2002.Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment153In the African monsoon region, Fontaine et al. (2011) investigated
recent observed trends using high-resolution gridded precipitation(period 1979-2002), OLR, and reanalyses. Their results revealed a rainfall
increase in North Africa since the mid-1990s. Over the longer term,
however, Zhou et al. (2008a,b) and Wang and Ding (2006) reported anoverall decreasing long-term trend in global land monsoon rainfall
during the last 54 years, which was mainly caused by decreasing rainfallin the North African and South Asian monsoons. 
For the American monsoon regions, Cavazos et al. (2008) reported
increases in the intensity of precipitation in the mountain sites of thenorthwestern Mexico section of the North American monsoon over the1961-1998 period, apparently related to an increased contribution fromheavy precipitation derived from tropical cyclones. Arriaga-Ramírez andCavazos (2010) found that total and extreme rainfall in the monsoonregion of western Mexico and the US southwest presented a statisticallysignificant increase during 1961-1998, mainly in winter. Groisman andKnight (2008) found that consecutive dry days (see Box 3-3 for defini tion)
have significantly increased in the US southwest. On the other hand,increases in heavy precipitation during 1960-2000 in the South Americanmonsoon have been documented by Marengo et al. (2009a,b) andRusticucci et al. (2010). Studies using circulation fields such as 850 hPawinds or moisture flux have been performed for the South Americanmonsoon system for assessments of the onset and end of the monsoon,and indicate that the onset exhibits a marked interannual variabilitylinked to variations in SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific and tropicalAtlantic (Gan et al., 2006; da Silva and de Carvalho, 2007; Raia andCavalcanti, 2008; Nieto-Ferreira and Rickenbach, 2011).
Attributing the causes of changes in monsoons is difficult in part
because there are substantial inter-model differences in representingAsian monsoon processes (Christensen et al., 2007). Most modelssimulate the general migration of seasonal tropical rain, although theobserved maximum rainfall during the monsoon season along the westcoast of India, the North Bay of Bengal, and adjoining northeast India ispoorly simulated by many models due to limited resolution. Bollasina andNigam (2009) show the presence of large systematic biases in coupledsimulations of boreal summer precipitation, evaporation, and SST in the
Indian Ocean. Many of the biases are pervasive, being common to most
simulations. 
The observed negative trend in global land monsoon rainfall is better
reproduced by atmospheric models forced by observed historical SSTthan by coupled models without explicit forcing by observed ocean
temperatures (Kim et al., 2008). This trend in the east Asian monsoon is
strongly linked to the warming trend over the central eastern Pacific and
the western tropical Indian Ocean (Zhou et al., 2008b). For the westAfrican monsoon, Joly and Voldoire (2010) explore the role of Gulf of
Guinea SSTs in its interannual variability. In most of the studied CMIP3
simulations, the interannual variability of SST is very weak in the Gulf of
Guinea, especially along the Guinean Coast. As a consequence, the
influence on the monsoon rainfall over the African continent is poorly
reproduced. It is suggested that this may be due to the counteractingeffects of the Pacific and Atlantic basins over the last decades. The
decreasing long-term trend in north African summer monsoon rainfall maybe due to the atmosphere response to observed SST variations (Hoerlinget al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2008b; Scaife et al., 2009). A similar trend inglobal monsoon precipitation in land regions is reproduced in CMIP3models’ 20th-century simulations when they include anthropogenicforcing, and for some simulations natural forcing (including volcanicforcing) as well, though the trend is much weaker in general, with theexception of one model (HadCM3) capable of producing a trend ofsimilar magnitude (Li et al., 2008). The decrease in east Asian monsoonrainfall also seems to be related to tropical SST changes (Li et al., 2008),
and the less spatially coherent positive trends in precipitation extremes
in the southeast Asian and north Australian monsoons appear to bepositively correlated with a La Niña-like SST pattern (Caesar et al., 2011).
A variety of factors, natural and anthropogenic, have been suggested as
possible causes of variations in monsoon s. Changes in regional mon soons
are strongly influenced by the changes in the states of dominant patternsof climate variability such as ENSO, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO),the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation(AMO), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) (see also Sections 3.4.2and 3.4.3). Additionally, model-based evidence has suggested that landsurface processes and land use changes could in some instancessignificantly impact regional monsoons. Tropical land cover change inAfrica and southeast Asia appears to have weaker local climatic impactsthan in Amazonia (Voldoire and Royer, 2004; Mabuchi et al., 2005a,b).Grimm et al. (2007) and Collini et al. (2008) explored possible feedbacksbetween soil moisture and precipitation during the early stages of themonsoon in South America, when the surface is not sufficiently wet, andsoil moisture anomalies may thus also modulate the development ofprecipitation. However, the influence of historical land use on themonsoon is difficult to quantify, due both to the poor documentation ofland use and difficulties in simulating the monsoon at fine scales. Theimpact of aerosols (black carbon and sulfate) on changes in rainfallvariability and amounts in monsoon regions has been discussed byMeehl et al. (2008), Lau et al. (2006), and Silva Dias et al. (2002). Thesestudies suggest that there are still large uncertainties and a strongmodel dependency in the representation of the relevant land surfaceprocesses and the role of aerosol direct forcing, and resulting interac tions
(e.g., in the case of land use forcing; Pitman et al., 2009).
Regarding projections of change in the monsoons, the AR4 (Christensen et
al., 2007) concluded: “There is a tendency for monsoonal circulations toresult in increased precipitation due to enhanced moisture convergence,despite a tendency towards weakening of the monsoonal flowsthemselves. However, many aspects of tropical climatic responses remainuncertain.” Held and Soden (2006) demonstrate that an increase in thehydrological cycle is accompanied by a global weakening of the large-scale circulation. As global warming is projected to lead to fasterwarming over land than over the oceans (e.g., Meehl et al., 2007b;Sutton et al., 2007), the continental-scale land-sea thermal contrast, amajor factor affecting monsoon circulations, will become stronger insummer. Based on this projection, a simple scenario is that the summer
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment154monsoon will be stronger and the winter monsoon will be weaker in the
future than now. However, model results derived from the analyses of15 CMIP3 global models are not as straightforward as implied by thissimple consideration (Tanaka et al., 2005), as they show a weakening ofthese tropical circulations by the late 21st century compared to the late20th century. In turn, such changes in circulation may lead to changesin precipitation associated with monsoons. For instance, the monsoonalprecipitation in Mexico and Central America is projected to decrease inassociation with increasing precipitation over the eastern equatorialPacific through changes in the Walker circulation and local Hadleycirculation (e.g., Lu et al., 2007). Furthermore, observations and modelssuggest that changes in monsoons are related at least in part tochanges in observed SSTs, as noted above. 
At regional scales, there is little consensus in GCM projections regarding
the sign of future change in monsoon characteristics, such as circulationand rainfall. For instance, while some models project an intensedrying of the Sahel under a global warming scenario, others project anintensification of the rains, and some project more frequent extremeevents (Cook and Vizy, 2006). Increases in precipitation are projected inthe Asian monsoon (along with an increase in interannual season-averaged precipitation variability), and in the southern part of the westAfrican monsoon, but with some decreases in the Sahel in northernsummer. In the Australian monsoon in southern summer, an analysis byMoise and Colman (2009) from the entire ensemble mean of CMIP3simulations suggested no changes in Australian tropical rainfall duringthe summer and only slightly enhanced interannual variability. 
A study of 19 CMIP3 global models reported a projected increase in
mean south Asian summer monsoon precipitation of 8% and a possibleextension of the monsoon period (Kripalani et al., 2007). A study(Ashfaq et al., 2009) from the downscaling of the National Center forAtmospheric Research (NCAR) CCSM3 global model using the RegCM3regional model suggests a weakening of the large-scale monsoon flowand suppression of the dominant intra-seasonal oscillatory modes withoverall weakening of the south Asian summer monsoon by the end ofthe 21st century, resulting in a decrease in summer precipitation insoutheast Asia.
Kitoh and Uchiyama (2006) used 15 models under the A1B scenario to
analyze the changes in intensity and duration of precipitation in the
Baiu-Changma-Meiyu rain band at the end of the 21st century. They
found a delay in early summer rain withdrawal over the region extending
from the Taiwan province of China, and across the Ryukyu Islands to the
south of Japan, contrasted with an earlier withdrawal over the Yangtze
Basin. They attributed this feature to El Niño-like mean state changes
over the monsoon trough and subtropical anticyclone over the western
Pacific region (Meehl et al., 2007b). A southwestward extension of the
subtropical anticyclone over the northwestern Pacific Ocean associated
with El Niño-like mean state changes and a dry air intrusion in the mid-
troposphere from the Asian continent to the northwest of Japan provides
favorable conditions for intense precipitation in the Baiu season in
Japan (Kanada et al., 2010a). Kitoh et al. (2009) projected changes inprecipitation characteristics during the east Asian summer rainy season,
using a 5-km mesh cloud-resolving model embedded in a 20-km meshglobal atmospheric model with CMIP3 mean SST changes. The frequencyof heavy precipitation was projected to increase at the end of the 21stcentury for hourly as well as daily precipitation. Further, extreme hourlyprecipitation was projected to increase even in the near future (2030s)when the temperature increase is still modest, even though uncertaintiesin the projection (and even the simulation) of hourly rainfall are still high.
Climate change scenarios for the 21st century show a weakening of the
North American monsoon through a weakening and poleward expansionof the Hadley cell (Lu et al., 2007). The expansion of the Hadley cell iscaused by an increase in the subtropical static stability, which pushespoleward the baroclinic instability zone and hence the outer boundaryof the Hadley cell. Simple physical arguments (Held and Soden, 2006)predict a slowdown of the tropical overturning circulation under globalwarming. A few studies (e.g., Marengo et al., 2009a) have projected overthe period 1960-2100 a weak tendency for an increase in dry spells. Theprojections show an increase in the frequency of rainfall extremes insoutheastern South America by the end of the 21st century, possibly dueto an intensification of the moisture transport from Amazonia by a morefrequent/intense low-level jet east of the Andes in the A2 emissionsscenario (Marengo et al., 2009a; Soares and Marengo, 2009). 
There are many deficiencies in model representation of the monsoons
and the processes affecting them, and this reduces confidence in theirability to project future changes. Some of the uncertainty in global andregional climate change projections in the monsoon regions results fromthe limits in the model representation of resolved processes (e.g., moistureadvection), the parameterizations of sub-grid-scale processes (e.g.,clouds, precipitation), and model simulations of feedback mechanismsat the global and regional scale (e.g., changes in land use/cover; seealso Section 3.1.4). Kharin et al. (2007) made an intercomparison ofprecipitation extremes in the tropical region in all AR4 models withobserved extremes expressed as 20-year return values. They found verylarge disagreement in the tropics suggesting that some physicalprocesses associated with extreme precipitation are not well representedby the models due to model resolution and physics. Shukla (2007) notedthat current climate models cannot even adequately predict the meanintensity and the seasonal variations of the Asian summer monsoon. Thisreduces confidence in the projected changes in extreme precipitationover the monsoon regions. Many of the important climatic effects of theMadden-Julian Oscillation (MJO, a natural mode of the climate systemoperating on time scales of about a month), including its impacts onrainfall variability in the monsoons, are still poorly simulated bycontemporary climate models (Christensen et al., 2007). 
Current GCMs still have difficulties and display a wide range of skill in
simulating the subseasonal variability associated with the Asian summermonsoon (Lin et al., 2008b). Most GCMs simulate westward propagationof the coupled equatorial easterly waves, but relatively poor eastwardpropagation of the MJO and overly weak variances for both the easterlywaves and the MJO. Most GCMs are able to reproduce the basic
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment155characteristics of the precipitation seasonal cycle associated with
the South American Monsoon System (SAMS), but there are largediscrepancies in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone represented bythe models in both intensity and location, and in its seasonal evolution(Vera et al., 2006). In addition, models exhibit large discrepancies in thedirection of the changes associated with the summer (SAMS) precipita tion,
which makes the projections for that region highly uncertain. Lin et al.(2008a) show that the coupled GCMs have significant problems anddisplay a wide range of skill in simulating the North American monsoonand associated intra-seasonal variability. 
Most of the models reproduce the monsoon rain belt, extending from
southeast to northwest, and its gradual northward shift in early summer,but overestimate the precipitation over the core monsoon regionthroughout the seasonal cycle and fail to reproduce the monsoonretreat in the fall. The AR4 assessed that models fail in representing themain features of the west African monsoon although most of them dohave a monsoonal climate albeit with some distortion (Christensen etal., 2007). Other major sources of uncertainty in projections of monsoonchanges are the responses and feedbacks of the climate system toemissions as represented in climate models. These uncertainties areparticularly related to the representation of the conversion of emissionsinto concentrations of radiatively active species (i.e., via atmosphericchemistry and carbon cycle models) and especially those derived fromaerosol products of biomass burning, which can affect the onset of therainy season (Silva Dias et al., 2002). The subsequent response of thephysical climate system complicates the nature of future projections ofmonsoon precipitation. Moreover, the long-term variations of modelskill in simulating monsoons and their variations represent an additionalsource of uncertainty for the monsoon regions, and indicate that theregional reliability of long climate model runs may depend on the timeslice for which the output of the model is analyzed.
The AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) concluded that the current
understanding of climate change in the monsoon regions remainsone of considerable uncertainty with respect to circulation andprecipitation. With a few exceptions in some monsoon regions,this has not changed. These conclusions have been based on very
few studies, there are many issues with model representation of
monsoons and the underlying processes, and there is littleconsensus in climate models, so there is low confidence in
projections of changes in monsoons, even in the sign of the change.However, one common pattern is a likely increase in extreme
precipitation in monsoon regions (see Section 3.3.2), though not
necessarily induced by changes in monsoon characteristics, and
not necessarily occurring in all monsoon regions.
3.4.2. El Niño-Southern Oscillation
The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural fluctuation of the
global climate system caused by equatorial ocean-atmosphere interac tion
in the tropical Pacific Ocean (Philander, 1990). The term ‘SouthernOscillation’ refers to a tendency for above-average surface atmospheric
pressures in the Indian Ocean to be associated with below-averagepressures in the Pacific, and vice versa. This oscillation is associatedwith variations in SSTs in the east equatorial Pacific. The oceanic andatmospheric variations are collectively referred to as ENSO. An El Niño
episode is one phase of the ENSO phenomenon and is associated withabnormally warm central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean surface
temperatures, while the opposite phase, a La Niña episode, is associatedwith abnormally cool ocean temperatures in this region. Both phasesare associated with a characteristic spatial pattern of droughts andfloods. An El Niño episode is usually accompanied by drought insoutheastern Asia, India, Australia, southeastern Africa, Amazonia, andnortheast Brazil, with fewer than normal tropical cyclones aroundAustralia and in the North Atlantic. Wetter than normal conditionsduring El Niño episodes are observed along the west coast of tropicalSouth America, subtropical latitudes of western North America, andsoutheastern America. In a La Niña episode the climate anomalies areusually the opposite of those in an El Niño. Pacific islands are stronglyaffected by ENSO variations. Recent research (e.g., Kenyon and Hegerl,2008; Ropelewski and Bell, 2008; Schubert et al., 2008a; Alexander et al.,2009; Grimm and Tedeschi, 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) has demonstratedthat different phases of ENSO (El Niño or La Niña episodes) also areassociated with different frequencies of occurrence of short-term weatherextremes such as heavy rainfall events and extreme temperatures. Therelationship between ENSO and interannual variations in tropical cycloneactivity is well known (e.g., Kuleshov et al., 2008). The simultaneousoccurrence of a variety of climate extremes in an El Niño episode (or aLa Niña episode) may provide special challenges for organizations copingwith disasters induced by ENSO (see also Section 3.1.1). Monitoring andpredicting ENSO can lead to disaster risk reduction through early warning(see Case Study 9.2.11).
The AR4 noted that orbital variations could affect the ENSO behavior
(Jansen et al., 2007). Cane (2005) found that a relatively simple coupledmodel suggested that systematic changes in El Niño could be stimulat-ed by seasonal changes in solar insolation. However, a more compre-hensive model simulation (Wittenberg, 2009) has suggested that long-term changes in the behavior of the phenomenon might occur evenwithout forcing from radiative changes. Vecchi and Wittenberg (2010)concluded that the “tropical Pacific could generate variations in ENSOfrequency and intensity on its own (via chaotic behavior), respond toexternal radiative forcings (e.g., changes in greenhouse gases, volcaniceruptions, atmospheric aerosols, etc), or both.” Meehl et al. (2009a)demonstrate that solar insolation variations related to the 11-yearsunspot cycle can affect ocean temperatures associated with ENSO.
ENSO has varied in strength over the last millennium with stronger
activity in the 17th century and late 14th century, and weaker activityduring the 12th and 15th centuries (Cobb et al., 2003; Conroy et al.,2009). On longer time scales, there is evidence that ENSO may havechanged in response to changes in the orbit of the Earth (Vecchi andWittenberg, 2010), with the phenomenon apparently being weakeraround 6,000 years ago (according to proxy measurements from coralsChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment156and climate model simulations; Rein et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2006;
Otto-Bliesner et al., 2009), and model simulations suggest that it wasstronger at the last glacial maximum (An et al., 2004). Fossil coralevidence indicates that the phenomenon continued to operate duringthe last glacial interval (Tudhope et al., 2001). Thus the paleoclimaticevidence indicates that ENSO can continue to operate, although alteredperhaps in intensity, in very different background climate states. 
The AR4 noted that the nature of ENSO has varied substantially over the
period of instrumental data, with strong events from the late 19thcentury through the first quarter of the 20th century and again after1950. An apparent climate shift around 1976-1977 was associated witha shift to generally above-normal SSTs in the central and eastern Pacificand a tendency toward more prolonged and stronger El Niño episodes(Trenberth et al., 2007). Ocean temperatures in the central equatorialPacific (the so-called NINO3 index) suggest a trend toward more fre quent
or stronger El Niño episodes over the past 50 to 100 years (Vecchi andWittenberg, 2010). Vecchi et al. (2006) reported a weakening of theequatorial Pacific pressure gradient since the 1960s, with a sharp dropin the 1970s. Power and Smith (2007) proposed that the apparentdominance of El Niño during the last few decades was due in part to achange in the background state of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI,the standardized difference in surface atmospheric pressure betweenTahiti and Darwin), rather than a change in variability or a shift to morefrequent El Niño events alone. Nicholls (2008) examined the behavior ofthe SOI and another index, the NINO3.4 index of central equatorialPacific SSTs, but found no evidence of trends in the variability or thepersistence of the indices [although Yu and Kao (2007) reported decadalvariations in the persistence barrier, the tendency for weaker persistenceacross the Northern Hemisphere spring], nor in their seasonal patterns.There was a trend toward what might be considered more ‘El Niño-like’behavior in the SOI (and more weakly in NINO3.4), but only through theperiod March to September and not in November to February, the seasonwhen El Niño and La Niña events typically peak. The trend in the SOIreflected only a trend in Darwin pressures, with no trend in Tahitipressures. Apart from this trend, the temporal/seasonal nature of ENSO hasbeen remarkably consistent through a period of strong global warming.There is evidence, however, of a tendency for recent El Niño episodes to
be centered more in the central equatorial Pacific than in the east Pacific
(Yeh et al., 2009), and for these central Pacific episodes to be increasing
in intensity (Lee and McPhaden, 2010). In turn, these changes mayexplain changes that have been noted in the remote influences of the
phenomenon on the climate over Australia and in the mid-latitudes
(Wang and Hendon, 2007; Weng et al., 2009). For instance, Taschetto etal. (2009) demonstrated that episodes with the warming centered in thecentral Pacific exhibit different patterns of Australian rainfall variations
relative to the east Pacific-centered El Niño events.
The possible role of increased greenhouse gases in affecting the behavior
of ENSO over the past 50 to 100 years is uncertain. Yeh et al. (2009)suggested that changes in the background temperature associated withincreases in greenhouse gases should affect the behavior of El Niño,
such as the location of the strongest SST anomalies, because El Niñobehavior is strongly related to the average ocean temperature gradients
in the equatorial Pacific. Some studies (e.g., Q. Zhang et al., 2008) havesuggested that increased activity might be due to increased CO
2;
however, no formal attribution study has yet been completed and someother studies (e.g., Power and Smith, 2007) suggest that changes in thephenomenon are within the range of natural variability (i.e., that no
change has yet been detected, let alone attributed to a specific cause). 
Global warming is projected to lead to a mean reduction in the zonal
mean wind across the equatorial Pacific (Vecchi and Soden, 2007b).However, this change should not be described as an ‘El Niño-like’ averagechange even though during an El Niño episode these winds also weaken,because there is only limited correspondence between these changes inthe mean state of the equatorial Pacific and an El Niño episode. TheAR4 determined that all models exhibited continued ENSO interannualvariability in projections through the 21st century, but the projectedbehavior of the phenomenon differed between models, and it wasconcluded that “there is no consistent indication at this time ofdiscernible changes in projected ENSO amplitude or frequency in the21st century” (Meehl et al., 2007b). Models project a wide variety ofchanges in ENSO variability and the frequency of El Niño episodes as aconsequence of increased greenhouse gas concentrations, with a rangebetween a 30% reduction to a 30% increase in variability (van Oldenborghet al., 2005). One model study even found that although ENSO activityincreased when atmospheric CO
2concentrations were doubled or
quadrupled, a considerable decrease in activity occurred when CO2was
increased by a factor of 16 times, much greater than is possible throughthe 21st century (Cherchi et al., 2008), suggesting a wide variety ofpossible ENSO changes as a result of CO
2changes. The remote impacts,
on rainfall for instance, of ENSO may change as CO2increases, even if
the equatorial Pacific aspect of ENSO does not change substantially. Forinstance, regions in which rainfall increases in the future tend to showincreases in interannual rainfall variability (Boer, 2009), without anystrong change in the interannual variability of tropical SSTs. Also, sincesome long-term projected changes in response to increased greenhousegases may resemble the climate response to an El Niño event, this mayenhance or mask the response to El Niño events in the future (Lau et al.,2008b; Müller and Roeckner, 2008). 
One change that models tend to project is an increasing tendency for El
Niño episodes to be centered in the central equatorial Pacific, ratherthan the traditional location in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Yeh et al.(2009) examined the relative frequency of El Niño episodes simulated incoupled climate models with projected increases in greenhouse gasconcentrations. A majority of models, especially those best able tosimulate the current ratio of central Pacific locations to east Pacificlocations of El Niño events, projected a further increase in the relativefrequency of these central Pacific events. Such a change would also haveimplications for the remote influence of the phenomenon on climate awayfrom the equatorial Pacific (e.g., Australia and India). However, even theprojection that the 21st century may see an increased frequency of centralPacific El Niño episodes, relative to the frequency of events locatedfurther east (Yeh et al., 2009), is subject to considerable uncertainty. OfChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment157the 11 coupled climate model simulations examined by Yeh et al. (2009),
three projected a relative decrease in the frequency of these centralPacific episodes, and only four of the models produced a statisticallysignificant change to more frequent central Pacific events. 
A caveat regarding all projections of future behavior of ENSO arises
from systematic biases in the depiction of ENSO behavior through the20th century by models (Randall et al., 2007; Guilyardi et al., 2009).Leloup et al. (2008) for instance, demonstrate that coupled climatemodels show wide differences in the ability to reproduce the spatialcharacteristics of SST variations associated with ENSO during the 20thcentury, and all models have failings. They concluded that it is difficultto even classify models by the quality of their reproductions of thebehavior of ENSO, because models scored unevenly in their reproductionof the different phases of the phenomenon. This makes it difficult todetermine which models to use to project future changes in ENSO.Moreover, most of the models are not able to reproduce the typicalcirculation anomalies associated with ENSO in the SouthernHemisphere (Vera and Silvestri, 2009) and the Northern Hemisphere(Joseph and Nigam, 2006).
There was no consistency in projections of changes in ENSO variability
or frequency at the time of the AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007b) and thissituation has not changed as a result of post-AR4 studies. The evidenceis that the nature of ENSO has varied in the past apparently sometimesin response to changes in radiative forcing but also possibly due tointernal climatic variability. Since radiative forcing will continue tochange in the future, we can confidently expect changes in ENSO andits impacts as well, although both El Niño and La Niña episodes willcontinue to occur (e.g., Vecchi and Wittenberg, 2010). Our current limited
understanding, however, means that it is not possible at this time toconfidently predict whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or dampeddue to anthropogenic climate change, or even if the frequency of El Niñoor La Niña episodes will change (Collins et al., 2010).
In summary, there is medium confidence in a recent trend toward
more frequent central equatorial Pacific El Niño episodes, butinsufficient evidence for more specific statements aboutobserved trends in ENSO. Model projections of changes in ENSO
variability and the frequency of El Niño episodes as a consequenceof increased greenhouse gas concentrations are not consistent,
and so there is low confidence in projections of changes in the
phenomenon. However, there is medium confidence regarding a
projected increase (projected by most GCMs) in the relativefrequency of central equatorial Pacific events, which typically
exhibit different patterns of climate variations than do theclassical East Pacific events.
3.4.3. Other Modes of Variability
Other natural modes of variability beside ENSO (Section 3.4.2) that arerelevant to extremes and disasters include the North Atlantic Oscillation(NAO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and the Indian Ocean Dipole
(IOD) (Trenberth et al., 2007). The NAO is a large-scale seesaw inatmospheric pressure between the subtropical high and the polar lowin the North Atlantic region. The positive NAO phase has a strongsubtropical high-pressure center and a deeper than normal Icelandiclow. This results in a shift of winter storms crossing the Atlantic Oceanto a more northerly track, and is associated with warm and wet wintersin northwestern Europe and cold and dry winters in northern Canadaand Greenland. Scaife et al. (2008) discuss the relationship betweenthe NAO and European extremes. Paleoclimatic data indicate that theNAO was persistently in its positive phase during medieval times andpersistently in its negative phase during the cooler Little Ice Age (Trouetet al., 2009). The NAO is closely related to the Northern Annular Mode(NAM); for brevity we focus here on the NAO but much of what is saidabout the NAO also applies to the NAM. The SAM is the largest mode ofSouthern Hemisphere extratropical variability and refers to north-southshifts in atmospheric mass between the middle and high latitudes. Itplays an important role in climate variability in these latitudes. The SAMpositive phase is linked to negative sea level pressure anomalies overthe polar regions and intensified westerlies. It has been associated withcooler than normal temperatures over most of Antarctica and Australia,with warm anomalies over the Antarctic Peninsula, southern SouthAmerica, and southern New Zealand, and with anomalously dry conditionsover southern South America, New Zealand, and Tasmania and wetanomalies over much of Australia and South Africa (e.g., Hendon et al.,2007). The IOD is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the IndianOcean. A positive IOD event is associated with anomalous cooling in thesoutheastern equatorial Indian Ocean and anomalous warming in thewestern equatorial Indian Ocean. Recent work (Ummenhofer et al., 2008,2009a,b) has implicated the IOD as a cause of droughts in Australia, andheavy rainfall in east Africa (Ummenhofer et al., 2009c). There is alsoevidence of modes of variability operating on multi-decadal time scales,notably the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). Variations in the PDO have been related toprecipitation extremes over North America (Zhang et al., 2010). 
Both the NAO and the SAM exhibited trends toward their positive phase
(strengthened mid-latitude westerlies) over the last three to four decades,although the NAO has been in its negative phase in the last few years.Goodkin et al. (2008) concluded that the variability in the NAO is linkedwith changes in the mean temperature of the Northern Hemisphere.Dong et al. (2011) demonstrated that some of the observed late 20th-century decadal-scale changes in NAO behavior could be reproduced byincreasing the CO
2concentrations in a coupled model, and concluded
that greenhouse gas concentrations may have played a role in forcingthese changes. The largest observed trends in the SAM occur inDecember to February, and model simulations indicate that these aredue mainly to stratospheric ozone changes. However it has been arguedthat anthropogenic circulation changes are poorly characterized by trendsin the annular modes (Woollings et al., 2008). Further complicatingthese trends, Silvestri and Vera (2009) reported changes in the typicalhemispheric circulation pattern related to the SAM and its associatedimpact on both temperature and precipitation anomalies, particularlyChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment158over South America and Australia, between the 1960s-1970s and
1980s-1990s. The time scales of variability in modes such as the AMOand PDO are so long that it is difficult to diagnose any change in theirbehavior in modern data, although some evidence suggests that thePDO may be affected by anthropogenic forcing (Meehl et al., 2009b).The AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) concluded that trends over recent decadesin the NAO and SAM are likely related in part to human activity. The
negative NAO phase of the last few years, however, with the lack offormal attribution studies, means that attribution of changes in the NAOto human activity in recent decades now can only be considered about
as likely as not (expert opinion). Attribution of the SAM trend to human
activity is still assessed to be likely (expert opinion) although mainly
attributable to trends in stratospheric ozone concentration (Hegerl etal., 2007).
The AR4 noted that there was considerable spread among the model
projections of the NAO, leading to low confidence in NAO projectedchanges, but the magnitude of the increase for the SAM is generallymore consistent across models (Meehl et al., 2007b). However, the abilityof coupled models to simulate the observed SAM impact on climatevariability in the Southern Hemisphere is limited (e.g., Miller et al., 2006;Vera and Silvestri, 2009). Variations in the longer time-scale modes ofvariability (AMO, PDO) might affect projections of changes in extremesassociated with the various natural modes of variability and globaltemperatures (Keenlyside et al., 2008).
Sea level pressure is projected to increase over the subtropics and mid-
latitudes, and decrease over high latitudes (Meehl et al., 2007b). Thiswould equate to trends in the NAO and SAM, with a poleward shift ofthe storm tracks of several degrees latitude and a consequent increasein cyclonic circulation patterns over the Arctic and Antarctica. In theSouthern Hemisphere, two opposing effects, stratospheric ozone recoveryand increasing greenhouse gases, can be expected to affect the modessuch as the SAM (Arblaster et al., 2011). During the 21st century, althoughstratospheric ozone concentrations are expected to recover, tending tolead to a weakening of the SAM, models consistently project polarvortex intensification to continue due to the increases in greenhousegases, except in summer where the competing effects of stratospheric
ozone recovery complicate this picture (Arblaster et al., 2011).
A recent study (Woollings et al., 2010) found a tendency toward a more
positive NAO under anthropogenic forcing through the 21st century
with one model, although they concluded that confidence in the model
projections was low because of deficiencies in its simulation of current-day
NAO regimes. Goodkin et al. (2008) predict continuing high variability,on multi-decadal scales, in the NAO with continued global warming.
Keenlyside et al. (2008) proposed that variations associated with themulti-decadal modes of variability may offset warming due to increasedgreenhouse gas concentrations over the next decade or so. Conway etal. (2007) reported that model projections of future IOD behavior showed
no consistency. Kay and Washington (2008) reported that under some
emissions scenarios, changes in a dipole mode in the Indian Ocean
could change rainfall extremes in southern Africa. In summary, it is likely that there has been an anthropogenic
influence on recent trends in the SAM (linked with trends instratospheric ozone rather than changes in greenhouse gases),but it is only about as likely as not that there have been
anthropogenic influences on observed trends in the NAO. Issueswith the ability of models to simulate current behavior of thesenatural modes, the influence of competing factors (e.g.,stratospheric ozone, greenhouse gases) on current and futuremode behavior, and inconsistency between the model projections(and the seasonal dependence of these projections), means thatthere is low confidence in the ability to project changes in the
modes including the NAO, SAM, and IOD. Models do, however,
consistently project a strengthening of the polar vortex in theSouthern Hemisphere from increasing greenhouse gases,although in summer stratospheric ozone recovery is expected tooffset this intensification.
3.4.4. Tropical Cyclones
Tropical cyclones occur in most tropical oceans and pose a significantthreat to coastal populations and infrastructure, and marine interestssuch as shipping and offshore activities. Each year, about 90 tropicalcyclones occur globally, and this number has remained roughly steadyover the modern period of geostationary satellites (since around themid-1970s). While the global frequency has remained steady, there canbe substantial inter-annual to multi-decadal frequency variability withinindividual ocean basins (e.g., Webster et al., 2005). This regional variability,particularly when combined with substantial inter-annual to multi-decadalvariability in tropical cyclone tracks (e.g., Kossin et al., 2010), presents asignificant challenge for disaster planning and mitigation aimed atspecific regions. 
Tropical cyclones are perhaps most commonly associated with extreme
wind, but storm-surge and freshwater flooding from extreme rainfallgenerally cause the great majority of damage and loss of life (e.g.,Rappaport, 2000; Webster, 2008). Related indirect factors, such as thefailure of the levee system in New Orleans during the passage ofHurricane Katrina (2005), or mudslides during the landfall of HurricaneMitch (1998) in Central America, represent important related impacts(Case Study 9.2.5). Projected sea level rise will further compound trop ical
cyclone surge impacts. Tropical cyclones that track poleward can undergoa transition to become extratropical cyclones. While these storms havedifferent characteristics than their tropical progenitors, they can still beaccompanied by a storm surge that can impact regions well away fromthe tropics (e.g., Danard et al., 2004).
Tropical cyclones are typically classified in terms of their intensity, which is
a measure of near-surface wind speed (sometimes categorized accordingto the Saffir-Simpson scale). The strongest storms (Saffir-Simpson cate gory
3, 4, and 5) are comparatively rare but are generally responsible for themajority of damage (e.g., Landsea, 1993; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008).Additionally, there are marked differences in the characteristics of bothChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment159observed and projected tropical cyclone variability when comparing
weaker and stronger tropical cyclones (e.g., Webster et al., 2005; Elsneret al., 2008; Bender et al., 2010), while records of the strongest stormsare potentially less reliable than those of their weaker counterparts(Landsea et al., 2006).
In addition to intensity, the structure and areal extent of the wind field
in tropical cyclones, which can be largely independent of intensity, alsoplay an important role on potential impacts, particularly from stormsurge (e.g., Irish and Resio, 2010), but measures of storm size are largelyabsent in historical data. Other relevant tropical cyclone measuresinclude frequency, duration, and track. Forming robust physical linksbetween all of the metrics briefly mentioned here and natural orhuman-induced changes in climate variability is a major challenge.Significant progress is being made, but substantial uncertainties stillremain due largely to data quality issues (see Section 3.2.1 and below)and imperfect theoretical and modeling frameworks (see below).
Observed Changes
Detection of trends in tropical cyclone metrics such as frequency,intensity, and duration remains a significant challenge. Historical tropicalcyclone records are known to be heterogeneous due to changingobserving technology and reporting protocols (e.g., Landsea et al., 2004).Further heterogeneity is introduced when records from multiple oceanbasins are combined to explore global trends because data quality andreporting protocols vary substantially between regions (Knapp andKruk, 2010). Progress has been made toward a more homogeneousglobal record of tropical cyclone intensity using satellite data (Knappand Kossin, 2007; Kossin et al., 2007), but these records are necessarilyconstrained to the satellite era and so only represent the past 30 to 40years.
Natural variability combined with uncertainties in the historical data
makes it difficult to detect trends in tropical cyclone activity. There havebeen no significant trends observed in global tropical cyclone frequencyrecords, including over the present 40-year period of satellite observations(e.g., Webster et al., 2005). Regional trends in tropical cyclone frequencyhave been identified in the North Atlantic, but the fidelity of these trendsis debated (Holland and Webster, 2007; Landsea, 2007; Mann et al.,
2007a). Different methods for estimating undercounts in the earlier partof the North Atlantic tropical cyclone record provide mixed conclusions
(Chang and Guo, 2007; Mann et al., 2007b; Kunkel et al., 2008; Vecchi
and Knutson, 2008). Regional trends have not been detected in other
oceans (Chan and Xu, 2009; Kubota and Chan, 2009; Callaghan andPower, 2011). It thus remains uncertain whether any observed increasesin tropical cyclone frequency on time scales longer than about 40 years
are robust, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities(Knutson et al., 2010).
Frequency estimation requires only that a tropical cyclone be identified
and reported at some point in its lifetime, whereas intensity estimationrequires a series of specifically targeted measurements over the entire
duration of the tropical cyclone (e.g., Landsea et al., 2006). Consequently,intensity values in the historical records are especially sensitive tochanging technology and improving methodology, which heightens thechallenge of detecting trends within the backdrop of natural variability.Global reanalyses of tropical cyclone intensity using a homogenoussatellite record have suggested that changing technology has introduceda non-stationary bias that inflates trends in measures of intensity(Kossin et al., 2007), but a significant upward trend in the intensity ofthe strongest tropical cyclones remains after this bias is accounted for(Elsner et al., 2008). While these analyses are suggestive of a linkbetween observed global tropical cyclone intensity and climate change,they are necessarily confined to a roughly 30-year period of satelliteobservations, and cannot provide clear evidence for a longer-term trend.
Time series of power dissipation, an aggregate compound of tropical
cyclone frequency, duration, and intensity that measures total energyconsumption by tropical cyclones, show upward trends in the NorthAtlantic and weaker upward trends in the western North Pacific over thepast 25 years (Emanuel, 2007), but interpretation of longer-term trendsin this quantity is again constrained by data quality concerns. Thevariability and trend of power dissipation can be related to SST andother local factors such as tropopause temperature and vertical windshear (Emanuel, 2007), but it is a current topic of debate whether localSST or the difference between local SST and mean tropical SST is themore physically relevant metric (Swanson, 2008). The distinction is animportant one when making projections of changes in power dissipationbased on projections of SST changes, particularly in the tropical Atlanticwhere SST has been increasing more rapidly than in the tropics as awhole (Vecchi et al., 2008). Accumulated cyclone energy, which is anintegrated metric analogous to power dissipation, has been decliningglobally since reaching a high point in 2005, and is presently at a 40-year low point (Maue, 2009). The present period of quiescence, as wellas the period of heightened activity leading up to the high point in 2005,does not clearly represent substantial departures from past variability(Maue, 2009).
Increases in tropical water vapor and rainfall (Trenberth et al., 2005; Lau
and Wu, 2007) have been identified and there is some evidence forrelated changes in tropical cyclone-related rainfall (Lau et al., 2008a),but a robust and consistent trend in tropical cyclone rainfall has not yetbeen established due to a general lack of studies. Similarly, an increasein the length of the North Atlantic hurricane season has been noted(Kossin, 2008), but the uncertainty in the amplitude of the trends andthe lack of additional studies limits the utility of these results for ameaningful assessment.
Estimates of tropical cyclone variability prior to the modern instrumental
historical record have been constructed using archival documents(Chenoweth and Devine, 2008), coastal marsh sediment records, andisotope markers in coral, speleothems, and tree rings, among othermethods (Frappier et al., 2007a). These estimates demonstrate centennial-to millennial-scale relationships between climate and tropical cycloneChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment160activity (Donnelly and Woodruff, 2007; Frappier et al., 2007b; Nott et al.,
2007; Nyberg et al., 2007; Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007; Neu, 2008;Woodruff et al., 2008a,b; Mann et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009), but gener ally
do not provide robust evidence that the observed post-industrial tropical
cyclone activity is unprecedented.
The AR4 Summary for Policymakers concluded that it is likely that an
increase had occurred in intense tropical cyclone activity since 1970 insome regions (IPCC, 2007b). The subsequent CCSP assessment report(Kunkel et al., 2008) concluded that it is likely that the frequency of
tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes in the North Atlantichas increased over the past 100 years, a time in which Atlantic SSTs alsoincreased. Kunkel et al. (2008) also concluded that the increase inAtlantic power dissipation is likely substantial since the 1950s. Based on
research subsequent to the AR4 and Kunkel et al. (2008), which furtherelucidated the scope of uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone data,the most recent assessment by the World Meteorological Organization(WMO) Expert Team on Climate Change Impacts on Tropical Cyclones(Knutson et al., 2010) concluded that it remains uncertain whether pastchanges in any tropical cyclone activity (frequency, intensity, rainfall)exceed the variability expected through natural causes, after accountingfor changes over time in observing capabilities. The present assessmentregarding observed trends in tropical cyclone activity is essentiallyidentical to the WMO assessment (Knutson et al., 2010): there is low
confidence that any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases
in tropical cyclone activity are robust, after accounting for past changesin observing capabilities.
Causes of the Observed Changes
In addition to the natural variability of tropical SSTs, several studieshave concluded that there is a detectable tropical SST warming trenddue to increasing greenhouse gases (Karoly and Wu, 2005; Knutson etal., 2006; Santer et al., 2006; Gillett et al., 2008a). The region where thisanthropogenic warming has occurred encompasses tropical cyclogenesisregions, and Kunkel et al. (2008) stated that it is very likely that human-
caused increases in greenhouse gases have contributed to the increase
in SSTs in the North Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific hurricane forma tion
regions over the 20th century.
Changes in the mean thermodynamic state of the tropics can be directly
linked to tropical cyclone variability within the theoretical framework of
potential intensity theory (Bister and Emanuel, 1998). In this framework,
the expected response of tropical cyclone intensity to observed climate
change is relatively straightforward: if climate change causes anincrease in the ambient potential intensity that tropical cyclones move
through, the distribution of intensities in a representative sample ofstorms is expected to shift toward greater intensities (Emanuel, 2000;Wing et al., 2007). The fractional changes associated with such a shiftin the distribution would be largest in the upper quantiles of thedistribution as the strongest tropical cyclones become stronger (Elsner
et al., 2008).Given the evidence that SST in the tropics has increased due to
increasing greenhouse gases, and the theoretical expectation thatincreases in potential intensity will lead to stronger storms, it is essentialto fully understand the relationship between SST and potential intensity.Observations demonstrate a strong positive correlation between SSTand the potential intensity. This relationship suggests that SST increaseswill lead to increased potential intensity, which will then ultimately leadto stronger storms (Emanuel, 2000; Wing et al., 2007). However, there isa growing body of research suggesting that local potential intensity iscontrolled by the difference between local SST and spatially averagedSST in the tropics (Vecchi and Soden, 2007a; Xie et al., 2010; Ramsayand Sobel, 2011). Since increases in SST due to global warming are notexpected to lead to continuously increasing SST gradients, this recentresearch suggests that increasing SST due to global warming, by itself,does not yet have a fully understood physical link to increasingly strongtropical cyclones.
The present period of heightened tropical cyclone activity in the North
Atlantic, concurrent with comparative quiescence in other ocean basins(e.g., Maue, 2009), is apparently related to differences in the rate of SSTincreases, as global SST has been rising steadily but at a slower ratethan has the Atlantic (Holland and Webster, 2007). The present period ofrelatively enhanced warming in the Atlantic has been proposed to bedue to internal variability (Zhang and Delworth, 2009), anthropogenictropospheric aerosols (Mann and Emanuel, 2006), and mineral (dust)aerosols (Evan et al., 2009). None of these proposed mechanisms providea clear expectation that North Atlantic SST will continue to increase ata greater rate than the tropical mean SST.
Changes in tropical cyclone intensity, frequency, genesis location,
duration, and track contribute to what is sometimes broadly defined as‘tropical cyclone activity.’ Of these metrics, intensity has the most directphysically reconcilable link to climate variability within the frameworkof potential intensity theory, as described above (Kossin and Vimont,2007). Statistical correlations between necessary ambient environmentalconditions (e.g., low vertical wind shear and adequate atmosphericinstability and moisture) and tropical cyclogenesis frequency have beenwell documented (DeMaria et al., 2001) but changes in these conditionsdue specifically to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations do notnecessarily preserve the same statistical relationships. For example, theobserved minimum SST threshold for tropical cyclogenesis is roughly26°C. This relationship might lead to an expectation that anthropogenicwarming of tropical SST and the resulting increase in the areal extent ofthe region of 26°C SST should lead to increases in tropical cyclonefrequency. However, there is a growing body of evidence that theminimum SST threshold for tropical cyclogenesis increases at about thesame rate as the SST increase due solely to greenhouse gas forcing(e.g., Ryan et al., 1992; Dutton et al., 2000; Yoshimura et al., 2006;Bengtsson et al., 2007; Knutson et al., 2008; Johnson and Xie, 2010).This is because the threshold conditions for tropical cyclogenesis arecontrolled not just by surface temperature but also by atmosphericstability (measured from the lower boundary to the tropopause), whichresponds to greenhouse gas forcing in a more complex way than SSTChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment161alone. That is, when the SST changes due to greenhouse warming are
deconvolved from the background natural variability, that part of the SSTvariability, by itself, has no manifest effect on tropical cyclogenesis. Inthis case, the simple observed relationship between tropical cyclogenesisand SST, while robust, does not adequately capture the relevant physicalmechanisms of tropical cyclogenesis in a warming world.
Another challenge to identifying causes behind observed changes in
tropical cyclone activity is introduced by uncertainties in the reanalysisdata used to identify environmental changes in regions where tropicalcyclones develop and evolve (Bister and Emanuel, 2002; Emanuel,2010). In particular, heterogeneity in upper-tropospheric kinematic andthermodynamic metrics complicates the interpretation of long-termchanges in vertical wind shear and potential intensity, both of which areimportant environmental controls on tropical cyclones. 
Based on a variety of model simulations, the expected long-term
changes in global tropical cyclone characteristics under greenhousewarming is a decrease or little change in frequency concurrent with anincrease in mean intensity. One of the challenges for identifying thesechanges in the existing data records is that the expected changespredicted by the models are generally small when compared withchanges associated with observed short-term natural variability. Basedon changes in tropical cyclone intensity predicted by idealized numericalsimulations with CO
2-induced tropical SST warming, Knutson and Tuleya
(2004) suggested that clearly detectable increases may not be manifestfor decades to come. Their argument was based on a comparison of theamplitude of the modeled upward trend (i.e., the signal) in storm inten sity
with the amplitude of the interannual variability (i.e., the noise). Therecent high-resolution dynamical downscaling study of Bender et al. (2010)supports this argument and suggests that the predicted increases in thefrequency of the strongest Atlantic storms may not emerge as a clearstatistically significant signal until the latter half of the 21st centuryunder the SRES A1B warming scenario. Still, it should be noted thatwhile these model projections suggest that a statistically significant signalmay not emerge until some future time, the likelihood of more intensetropical cyclones is projected to continually increase throughout the21st century.
With the exception of the North Atlantic, much of the global tropical
cyclone data is confined to the period from the mid-20th century topresent. In addition to the limited period of record, the uncertainties in
the historical tropical cyclone data (Section 3.2.1 and this section) and
the extent of tropical cyclone variability due to random processes and
linkages with various climate modes such as El Niño, do not presently
allow for the detection of any clear trends in tropical cyclone activity
that can be attributed to greenhouse warming. As such, it remains
unclear to what degree the causal phenomena described here have
modulated post-industrial tropical cyclone activity.
The AR4 concluded that it is more likely than not that anthropogenic
influence has contributed to increases in the frequency of the most
intense tropical cyclones (Hegerl et al., 2007). Based on subsequentresearch that further elucidated the scope of uncertainties in both the
historical tropical cyclone data as well as the physical mechanismsunderpinning the observed relationships, no such attribution conclusionwas drawn in the recent WMO assessment (Knutson et al., 2010). Thepresent assessment regarding detection and attribution of trends intropical cyclone activity is similar to the WMO assessment (Knutson etal., 2010): the uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, theincomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms linking tropicalcyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree of tropical cyclonevariability – comprising random processes and linkages to variousnatural climate modes such as El Niño – provide only low confidence for
the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity toanthropogenic influences. 
Projected Changes and Uncertainties
The AR4 concluded (Meehl et al., 2007b) that a broad range of modelingstudies project a likely increase in peak wind intensity and near-storm
precipitation in future tropical cyclones. A reduction of the overallnumber of storms was also projected (but with lower confidence), with agreater reduction in weaker storms in most basins and an increase in thefrequency of the most intense storms. Knutson et al. (2010) concludedthat it is likely that the mean maximum wind speed and near-storm
rainfall rates of tropical cyclones will increase with projected 21st-century warming, and it is more likely than not that the frequency of the
most intense storms will increase substantially in some basins, but it islikely that overall global tropical cyclone frequency will decrease or
remain essentially unchanged. The conclusions here are similar to thoseof the AR4 and Knutson et al. (2010).
The spatial resolution of some models such as the CMIP3 coupled
ocean-atmosphere models used in the AR4 is generally not high enoughto accurately resolve tropical cyclones, and especially to simulate theirintensity (Randall et al., 2007). Higher-resolution global models havehad some success in reproducing tropical cyclone-like vortices (e.g.,Chauvin et al., 2006; Oouchi et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2009), but onlytheir coarse characteristics. Significant progress has been recentlymade, however, using downscaling techniques whereby high-resolutionmodels capable of reproducing more realistic tropical cyclones are runusing boundary conditions provided by either reanalysis data sets oroutput fields from lower-resolution climate models such as those usedin the AR4 (e.g., Knutson et al., 2007; Emanuel et al., 2008; Knutson etal., 2008; Emanuel, 2010). A recent study by Bender et al. (2010) appliesa cascading technique that downscales first from global to regionalscale, and then uses the simulated storms from the regional model toinitialize a very high-resolution hurricane forecasting model. Thesedownscaling studies have been increasingly successful at reproducingobserved tropical cyclone characteristics, which provides increasedconfidence in their projections, and it is expected that more progresswill be made as computing resources improve. Still, awareness thatlimitations exist in the models used for tropical cyclone projections,particularly the ability to accurately reproduce natural climate phenomenaChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment162that are known to modulate storm behavior (e.g., ENSO and MJO), is
important for context when interpreting model output (Sections 3.2.3.2and 3.4.2).
While detection of long-term past increases in tropical cyclone activity
is complicated by data quality and signal-to-noise issues (as statedabove), theory (Emanuel, 1987) and idealized dynamical models(Knutson and Tuleya, 2004) both predict increases in tropical cycloneintensity under greenhouse warming. Recent simulations with high-resolution dynamical models (Oouchi et al., 2006; Bengtsson et al., 2007;Gualdi et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2008; Sugi et al., 2009; Bender et al.,2010) and statistical-dynamical models (Emanuel, 2007) consistentlyfind that greenhouse warming causes tropical cyclone intensity to shifttoward stronger storms by the end of the 21st century (2 to 11% increasein mean maximum wind speed globally). These and other models alsoconsistently project little change or a reduction in overall tropicalcyclone frequency (e.g., Gualdi et al., 2008; Sugi et al., 2009; Murakamiet al., 2011), but with an accompanying substantial fractional increasein the frequency of the strongest storms and increased precipitationrates (in the models for which these metrics were examined). Currentmodels project changes in overall global frequency ranging from adecrease of 6 to 34% by the late 21st century (Knutson et al., 2010). Thedownscaling experiments of Bender et al. (2010) – which use an 18-model ensemble-mean of CMIP3 simulations to nudge a high-resolutiondynamical model (Knutson et al., 2008) that is then used to initialize avery high-resolution dynamical model – project a 28% reduction in theoverall frequency of Atlantic storms and an 80% increase in the frequencyof Saffir-Simpson category 4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes over the next 80years (A1B scenario). 
The projected decreases in global tropical cyclone frequency may be due
to increases in vertical wind shear (Vecchi and Soden, 2007c; Zhao etal., 2009; Bender et al., 2010), a weakening of the tropical circulation(Sugi et al., 2002; Bengtsson et al., 2007) associated with a decrease inthe upward mass flux accompanying deep convection (Held and Soden,2006), or an increase in the saturation deficit of the middle troposphere(Emanuel et al., 2008). For individual basins, there is much moreuncertainty in projections of tropical cyclone frequency, with changes of
up to ±50% or more projected by various models (Knutson et al., 2010).When projected SST changes are considered in the absence of projectedradiative forcing changes, Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone frequencyhas been found to increase (Wehner et al., 2010), which is congruent
with the hypothesis that SST changes alone do not capture the relevant
physical mechanisms controlling tropical cyclogenesis (e.g., Emanuel,
2010). 
As noted above, observed changes in rainfall associated with tropical
cyclones have not been clearly established. However, as water vapor in
the tropics increases (Trenberth et al., 2005) there is an expectation forincreased heavy rainfall associated with tropical cyclones in response toassociated moisture convergence increases (Held and Soden, 2006). This
increase is expected to be compounded by increases in intensity as
dynamical convergence under the storm is enhanced. Models in whichtropical cyclone precipitation rates have been examined are highly
consistent in projecting increased rainfall within the area near thetropical cyclone center under 21st century warming, with increases of3 to 37% (Knutson et al., 2010). Typical projected increases are near20% within 100 km of storm centers.
Another type of projection that is sometimes inferred from the literature
is based on extrapolation of an observed statistical relationship (seealso Section 3.2.3). These relationships are typically constructed on pastobserved variability that represents a convolution of anthropogenicallyforced variability and natural variability across a broad range of timescales. In general, however, these relationships cannot be expected torepresent all of the relevant physics that control the phenomena ofinterest, and their extrapolation beyond the range of the observedvariability they are built on is not reliable. As an example, there is astrong observed correlation between local SST and tropical cyclonepower dissipation (Emanuel, 2007). If 21st-century SST projections areapplied to this relationship, power dissipation is projected to increase byabout 300% in the next century (Vecchi et al., 2008; Knutson et al.,2010). Alternatively, there is a similarly strong relationship betweenpower dissipation and relative SST, which represents the differencebetween local and tropical-mean SST and has been argued to serve asa proxy for local potential intensity (Vecchi and Soden, 2007a). When21st-century projections of relative SST are considered, this latterrelationship projects almost no change in power dissipation in the nextcentury (Vecchi et al., 2006). Both of these statistical relationships canbe reasonably defended based on physical arguments but it is not clearwhich, if either, is correct (Ramsay and Sobel, 2011). 
When simulating 21st-century warming under the A1B emission scenario
(or a close analog), the present models and downscaling techniques as awhole are consistent in projecting (1) decreases or no change in tropicalcyclone frequency, (2) increases in intensity and fractional increases innumber of most intense storms, and (3) increases in tropical cyclone-related rainfall rates. Differences in regional projections lead to lowerconfidence in basin-specific projections of intensity and rainfall, andconfidence is particularly low for projections of frequency withinindividual basins. More specifically, while projections under 21st-centurygreenhouse warming indicate that it is likely that the global frequency
of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged,an increase in mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is also likely ,
although increases may not occur in all tropical regions. This assessmentis essentially identical with that of the recent WMO assessment (Knutsonet al., 2010). Furthermore, while it is likely that overall global frequency
will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged, it is more likely
than not that the frequency of the most intense storms (e.g., Saffir-
Simpson category 4 and 5) will increase substantially in some oceanbasins, again agreeing with the recent WMO assessment (Knutson et al.,2010). Based on the level of consistency among models, and physicalreasoning, it is likely that tropical cyclone-related rainfall rates will
increase with greenhouse warming. Confidence in future projections forparticular ocean basins is undermined by the inability of global modelsto reproduce accurate details at scales relevant to tropical cyclone
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment163genesis, track, and intensity evolution. Of particular concern is the lim ited
ability of global models to accurately simulate upper-tropospheric wind(Cordero and Forster, 2006; Bender et al., 2010), which modulates verticalwind shear and tropical cyclone genesis and intensity evolution. Thusthere is low confidence in projections of changes in tropical cyclone
genesis, location, tracks, duration, or areas of impact, and existingmodel projections do not show dramatic large-scale changes in thesefeatures.
In summary, there is low confidence that any observed long-term
(i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity arerobust, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities.The uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, theincomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms linkingtropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree oftropical cyclone variability provide only low confidence for the
attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activityto anthropogenic influences. There is low confidence in projections
of changes in tropical cyclone genesis, location, tracks, duration,or areas of impact. Based on the level of consistency amongmodels, and physical reasoning, it is likely that tropical cyclone-
related rainfall rates will increase with greenhouse warming. Itis likely that the global frequency of tropical cyclones will either
decrease or remain essentially unchanged. An increase in meantropical cyclone maximum wind speed is likely , although increases
may not occur in all tropical regions. While it is likely that overall
global frequency will either decrease or remain essentiallyunchanged, it is more likely than not that the frequency of the most
intense storms will increase substantially in some ocean basins.
3.4.5. Extratropical Cyclones
Extratropical cyclones (synoptic-scale low-pressure systems) existthroughout the mid-latitudes in both hemispheres and mainly developover the oceanic basins in the proximity of the upper-tropospheric jetstreams, as a result of flow over mountains (lee cyclogenesis) or throughconversions from tropical to extratropical systems. It should be notedthat regionalized smaller-scale mid-latitude circulation phenomena suchas polar lows and mesoscale cyclones are not treated in this section (but
see Sections 3.3.3 and 3.4.3). Extratropical cyclones are the main polewardtransporter of heat and moisture and may be accompanied by adverseweather conditions such as windstorms, the buildup of waves and stormsurges, or extreme precipitation events. Thus, changes in the intensity of
extratropical cyclones or a systematic shift in the geographical location
of extratropical cyclone activity may have a great impact on a wide
range of regional climate extremes as well as the long-term changes intemperature and precipitation. Extratropical cyclones mainly form andgrow via atmospheric instabilities such as a disturbance along a zone of
strong temperature contrast (baroclinic instabilities), which is a reservoirof available potential energy that can be converted into the kinetic energyassociated with extratropical cyclones. Intensification of the cyclones
may also take place due to processes such as release of energy due tophase changes of water (latent heat release) (Gutowski et al., 1992;
Wernli et al., 2002). Why should we expect climate change to influenceextratropical cyclones? A simplified line of argument would be that boththe large-scale low and high level pole to equator temperature gradientsmay change (possibly in opposite directions) in a climate change scenarioleading to a change in the atmospheric instabilities responsible forcyclone formation and growth (baroclinicity). These changes may beinduced by a variety of mechanisms operating in different parts of theatmospheric column ranging from changing surface conditions (Deser etal., 2007; Bader et al., 2011) to stratospheric changes (Son et al., 2010).In addition, changes in precipitation intensities within extratropicalcyclones may change the latent heat release. According to theories onwave-mean flow interaction, changes in the extratropical storm tracks arealso associated with changes in the large-scale flow (Robinson, 2000;Lorenz and Hartmann, 2003). A latitudinal shift of the upper troposphericjet would be accompanied by a latitudinal shift in the extratropicalstorm track. It is, however, still unclear to what extent a latitudinal shiftin the jet changes the total storm track activity rather than shifting itlatitudinally (W ettstein and Wallace, 2010). Even within the very simplified
outline above the possible impacts of climate change on extratropicalcyclone development are many and clearly not trivial.
When validated using reanalyses with similar horizontal resolution,
climate models are found to represent the general structure of thestorm track pattern well (Bengtsson et al., 2006; Greeves et al., 2007;Ulbrich et al., 2008; Catto et al., 2010). However, using data from fivedifferent coupled models, the rate of transfer of zonal available potentialenergy to eddy available potential energy in synoptic systems was foundto be too large, yielding too much energy and an overactive energy cycle(Marques et al., 2011). Models tend to have excessively zonal stormtracks and some show a poor extension of the storm tracks into Europe(Pinto et al., 2006; Greeves et al., 2007; Orsolini and Sorteberg, 2009).It has also been noted that r
epresentation of cyclone activity may
depend on the physics formulations and the horizontal resolution of themodel (Jung et al., 2006; Greeves et al., 2007)
. 
Paleoclimatic proxies for extratropical cyclone variability are still few,
but progress is being made in using coastal dune field development andsand grain content of peat bogs as proxies for storminess. Publicationscovering parts of western Europe indicate enhanced sand movement inEuropean coastal areas during the Little Ice Age (Wilson et al., 2004; deJong et al., 2006, 2007; Clemmensen et al., 2007; Clarke and Rendell, 2009;Sjogren, 2009). It should be noted that sand influx is also influenced bysediment availability, which is controlled mainly by the degree ofvegetation cover and the moisture content of the sediment (Li et al.,2004; Wiggs et al., 2004). Intense cultivation, overgrazing, and forestdisturbance make soils more prone to erosion, which can lead toincreased sand transport even under less windy conditions. Thus theinformation gained from paleoclimatic proxies to put the last 100 yearsof extratropical cyclone variability in context is limited.
Century-long time-series of estimates of extremes in geostrophic wind
deduced from triangles of pressure stations, pressure tendencies fromChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment164single stations (see Section 3.3.3 for details), or oceanic variables such
as extremes in non-tide residuals are (if these are located in the vicinityof the main storm tracks) possible proxies for extratropical cycloneactivity. Trend detection in extratropical cyclone variables such asnumber of cyclones, intensity, and activity (parameters integratingcyclone intensity, number, and possibly duration) became possible withthe development of reanalyses, but remains challenging. Problems withreanalyses have been especially pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere(Hodges et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2006). Even though different reanalysescorrespond well in the Northern Hemisphere (Hodges et al., 2003;Hanson et al., 2004), changes in the observing system giving artificialtrends in integrated water vapor and kinetic energy (Bengtsson et al.,2004) may have influenced trends in both the number and intensity ofcyclones. In addition, studies indicate that the magnitude and even theexistence of the changes may depend on the choice of reanalysis (Trigo,2006; Raible et al., 2008; Simmonds et al., 2008; Ulbrich et al., 2009)and cyclone tracking algorithm (Raible et al., 2008).
The AR4 noted a likely net increase in the frequency/intensity of
Northern Hemisphere extreme extratropical cyclones and a polewardshift in the tracks since the 1950s (Trenberth et al., 2007; Table 3.8), andcited several papers showing increases in the number or strength ofintense extratropical cyclones both over the North Pacific and the NorthAtlantic storm track (Trenberth et al., 2007, p. 312) during the last 50years. Studies using reanalyses indicate a northward and eastward shiftin the Atlantic cyclone activity during the last 60 years with both morefrequent and more intense wintertime cyclones in the high-latitudeAtlantic (Weisse et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006; Schneidereit et al., 2007;Raible et al., 2008; Vilibic and Sepic, 2010) and fewer in the mid-latitudeAtlantic (Wang et al., 2006; Raible et al., 2008). The increase in high-latitude cyclone activity was also reported in several studies of Arcticcyclone activity (X.D. Zhang et al., 2004; Sorteberg and Walsh, 2008; Seppand Jaagus, 2011). Using ship-based trends in mean sea level pressure(MSLP) variance (which is tied to cyclone intensity), Chang (2007) foundwintertime Atlantic trends to be consistent with National Centers forEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis trends in the Atlantic, butslightly weaker. There are inconsistencies among studies of extremecyclones in reanalyses, since some studies show an increase in intensity
and number of extreme Atlantic cyclones (Geng and Sugi, 2001; Pacioreket al., 2002; Lehmann et al., 2011) while others show a reduction (Gulev
et al., 2001). These differences may in part be due to sensitivities of theidentification schemes and different definitions of an extreme cyclone
(Leckebusch et al., 2006; Pinto et al., 2006). New studies have confirmed
that a positive NAM/NAO (see Section 3.4.3) corresponds to strongerAtlantic/European cyclone activity (e.g., Chang, 2009; Pinto et al., 2009;X.L. Wang et al., 2009b). However, studies using long historical recordsseem to suggest that some of these links may be statistically intermittent(Hanna et al., 2008; Matulla et al., 2008; Allan et al., 2009) due tointerdecadal shifts in the location of the positions of the NAO pressure
centers (Vicente-Serrano and Lopez-Moreno, 2008; X.D. Zhang et al.,
2008). It is unclear to what extent the statistical intermittency impliesthat the underlying physical processes creating the connection act only
intermittently. A possible influence of the Pacific North America (PNA)pattern on the entrance of the North Atlantic storm track (over
Newfoundland) has been reported by Pinto et al. (2011). It should benoted that there is some suggestion that the reanalyses cover a timeperiod that starts with relatively low cyclonic activity in northern coastalEurope in the 1960s and reaches a maximum in the 1990s. Long-termEuropean storminess proxies show no clear trends over the last century(Hanna et al., 2008; Allan et al., 2009; see Section 3.3.3 for details).
Studies using reanalyses and in situ data for the last 50 years have noted
an increase in the number and intensity of north Pacific wintertimeintense extratropical cyclone systems since the 1950s (Graham and Diaz,2001; Simmonds and Keay, 2002; Raible et al., 2008) and cyclone activity(X.D. Zhang et al., 2004), but signs of some of the trends disagreedwhen different tracking algorithms or reanalysis products were used(Raible et al., 2008). A slight positive trend has been found in northPacific extreme cyclones (Geng and Sugi, 2001; Gulev et al., 2001;Paciorek et al., 2002). Using ship measurements, Chang (2007) foundintensity-related wintertime trends in the Pacific to be about 20 to 60%of that found in the reanalysis. Long-term in situ observations of north
Pacific cyclones based on observed pressure data are considerablyfewer than for coastal Europe. However, using hourly tide gauge recordsfrom the western coast of the United States as a proxy for storminess,an increasing trend in the extreme winter Non-Tide Residuals (NTR) hasbeen observed in the last decades (Bromirski et al., 2003; Menendez et al.,2008). Years having high NTR were linked to a large-scale atmosphericcirculation pattern, with intense storminess associated with a broad,south-easterly displaced, deep Aleutian low that directed storm trackstoward the US West Coast. North Pacific cyclonic activity has beenlinked to tropical SST anomalies (NINO3.4; see Section 3.4.2) and thePNA (Eichler and Higgins, 2006; Favre and Gershunov, 2006; Seierstadet al., 2007), showing that the PNA and NINO3.4 influence storminess,in particular over the eastern North Pacific with an equatorward shift instorm tracks in the North Pacific basin, as well as an increase in stormtrack activity along the US East Coast during El Niño events.
Based on reanalyses, North American cyclone numbers have increased
over the last 50 years, with no statistically significant change in cycloneintensity (X.D. Zhang et al., 2004). Hourly MSLP data from Canadianstations showed that winter cyclones have become significantly morefrequent, longer lasting, and stronger in the lower Canadian Arctic overthe last 50 years (1953-2002), but less frequent and weaker in the south,especially along the southeast and southwest Canadian coasts (Wanget al., 2006). Further south, a tendency toward weaker low-pressuresystems over the past few decades was found for US East Coast wintercyclones using reanalyses, but no statistically significant trends in thefrequency of occurrence of systems (Hirsch et al., 2001).
Studies on extratropical cyclone activity in northern Asia are few. Using
reanalyses, a decrease in extratropical cyclone activity (X.D. Zhang et al.,2004) and intensity (X.D. Zhang et al., 2004; X. Wang et al., 2009) overthe last 50 years has been reported for northern Eurasia (60-40°N) witha possible northward shift with increased cyclone frequency in the higherlatitudes (50-45°N) and decrease in the lower latitudes (south of 45°N),
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment165based on a study with reanalyses. The low-latitude (south of 45°N)
decrease was also noted by Zou et al. (2006), who reported a decreasein the number of severe storms for mainland China based on an analysisof extremes of observed 6-hourly pressure tendencies over the last 50years. 
Alexander and Power (2009) showed that the number of observed
severe storms at Cape Otway (south-east Australia) has decreasedsince the mid-19th century, strengthening the evidence of a southwardshift in Southern Hemisphere storm tracks previously noted usingreanalyses (Fyfe, 2003; Hope et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006). Frederiksenand Frederiksen (2007) linked the reduction in cyclogenesis at 30°Sand southward shift to a decrease in the vertical mean meridionaltemperature gradient. Using reanalyses, both Pezza et al. (2007) andLim and Simmonds (2009) have confirmed previous studies showing atrend toward more intense low-pressure systems. However, the trend ofa decreasing number of cyclones seems to depend on the choice ofreanalysis and pressure level (Lim and Simmonds, 2009), emphasizingthe weaker consistency among reanalysis products for the SouthernHemisphere extratropical cyclones. Recent studies support the notionof more cyclones around Antarctica when the SAM (see Section 3.4.3)is in its positive phase and a shift of cyclones toward mid-latitudeswhen the SAM is in its negative phase (Pezza and Simmonds, 2008).Additionally, more intense (and fewer) cyclones seem to occur whenthe PDO (see Section 3.4.3) is strongly positive and vice versa (Pezza etal., 2007). 
In conclusion, it is likely that there has been a poleward shift in the
main northern and southern storm tracks during the last 50 years. Thereis strong agreement with respect to this change between severalreanalysis products for a wide selection of cyclone parameters andcyclone identification methods and European and Australian pressure-based storminess proxies are consistent with a poleward shift over thelast 50 years, which indicates that the evidence is robust. Advances havebeen made in documenting the observed decadal and multi-decadalvariability of extratropical cyclones using proxies for storminess. So therecent poleward shift should be seen in light of new studies with longertime spans that indicate that the last 50 years coincide with relatively
low cyclonic activity in northern coastal Europe in the beginning of the
period. Several studies using reanalyses suggest an intensification of
high-latitude cyclones, but there is still insufficient knowledge of how
changes in the observational systems are influencing the cyclone
intensification in reanalyses so even in cases of high agreement among
the studies the evidence cannot be considered to be robust, thus we
have only low confidence in these changes. Other regional changes in
intensity and the number of cyclones have been reported. However, the
level of agreement between different studies using different tracking
algorithms, different reanalyses, or different cyclone parameters is still
low. Thus, we have low confidence in the amplitude, and in some
regions in the sign, of the regional changes .
Regarding possible causes of the observed poleward shift, the AR4
concluded that trends over recent decades in the Northern andSouthern Annular Modes, which correspond to sea level pressure
reductions over the poles, are likely related in part to human activity,
but an anthropogenic influence on extratropical cyclones had not beenformally detected, owing to large internal variability and problems dueto changes in observing systems (Hegerl et al., 2007). Anthropogenicinfluences on these modes of variability are also discussed in Section3.4.3.
Seasonal global sea level pressure changes have been shown to be
inconsistent with simulated internal variability (Giannini et al., 2003;Gillett et al., 2005; Gillett and Stott, 2009; X.L. Wang et al., 2009a), butchanges in sea level pressure in regions of extratropical cyclones (mid-and high latitudes) have not formally been attributed to anthropogenicforcings (Gillett and Stott, 2009). However, the trend pattern inatmospheric storminess as inferred from geostrophic wind energy andocean wave heights has been found to contain a detectable response toanthropogenic and natural forcings with the effect of external forcingsbeing strongest in the winter hemisphere (X.L. Wang et al., 2009a).Nevertheless, the models generally simulate smaller changes thanobserved and also appear to underestimate the internal variability,reducing the robustness of their detection results. New idealized studieshave advanced the physical understanding of how storm tracks mayrespond to changes in the underlying surface conditions, indicating thata uniform SST increase weakens (reduced cyclone intensity or numberof cyclones) and shifts the storm track poleward and strengthened SSTgradients near the subtropical jet may lead to a meridional shift in thestorm track either toward the poles or the equator depending on thelocation of the SST gradient change (Deser et al., 2007; Brayshaw et al.,2008; Semmler et al., 2008; Kodama and Iwasaki, 2009), but the averageglobal cyclone activity is not expected to change much under moderategreenhouse gas forcing (O’Gorman and Schneider, 2008; Bengtsson et al.,2009). Studies have also emphasized the important role of stratosphericchanges (induced by ozone or greenhouse gas changes) in explaininglatitudinal shifts in storm tracks and several mechanisms have beenproposed (Son et al., 2010). This has particularly strengthened theunderstanding of the Southern Hemisphere changes. According to Fogtet al. (2009) both coupled climate models and observed trends in theSAM were found to be outside the range of internal climate variabilityduring the austral summer. This was mainly attributed to stratosphericozone depletion (see Section 3.4.3).
In summary, there is medium confidence in an anthropogenic influence
on the observed poleward shift in extratropical cyclone activity. It hasnot formally been attributed. However indirect evidence such as globalanthropogenic influence on the sea level pressure distribution and trendpatterns in atmospheric storminess inferred from geostrophic wind andocean wave heights has been found. While physical understanding ofhow anthropogenic forcings may influence extratropical cyclone stormtracks has strengthened, the importance of the different mechanisms inthe observed shifts is still unclear.
The AR4 reported that in a future warmer climate, a consistent projection
from the majority of the coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs is fewer
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment166mid-latitude storms averaged over each hemisphere (Meehl et al.,
2007b) and a poleward shift of storm tracks in both hemispheres(particularly evident in the Southern Hemisphere), with greater stormactivity at higher latitudes (Meehl et al., 2007b). 
A poleward shift in the upper level tropospheric storm track due to
increased greenhouse gas forcing is supported by post-AR4 studies(Lorenz and DeWeaver, 2007; O’Gorman, 2010; Wu et al., 2011). Itshould be noted that other studies indicate that the poleward shift isless clear when models including a full stratosphere or ozone recoveryare used (Huebener et al., 2007; Son et al., 2008; Morgenstern et al.,2010; Scaife et al., 2011) and the strength of the poleward shift is oftenseen more clearly in upper-level quantities than in low-level transientparameters (Ulbrich et al., 2008). Post-AR4 single model studies supportthe projection of a reduction in extratropical cyclones averaged over theNorthern Hemisphere during future warming (Finnis et al., 2007;Bengtsson et al., 2009; Orsolini and Sorteberg, 2009). However, neitherthe global changes in storm frequency or intensity were found to bestatistically significant by Bengtsson et al. (2009), although they wereaccompanied by significant increases in total and extreme precipitation.
Models tend to project a reduction of winter cyclone activity throughout
the mid-latitude North Pacific and for some models a north-easternmovement of the North Pacific storm track (Loeptien et al., 2008; Ulbrichet al., 2008; Favre and Gershunov, 2009; McDonald, 2011). However, theexact geographical pattern of cyclone frequency anomalies exhibitslarge variations across models (Teng et al., 2008; Favre and Gershunov,2009; Laine et al., 2009).
Using band-passed sea level pressure data from 16 CMIP3 coupled
GCMs, Ulbrich et al. (2008) showed regional increases in the storm trackactivity over the Eastern North Atlantic/Western European area. Thiseastward or southeastward extension of the storm track is also found inother studies (Ulbrich et al., 2008; Laine et al., 2009; McDonald, 2011) andmay be attributed to a local minimum in ocean warming in the centralNorth Atlantic and subsequent local changes in baroclinicity (McDonald,2011). In line with the eastward shift, Donat et al. (2010a) projected anincrease in wind storm days for central Europe by the end of the 21stcentury. The increase varies according to the definition of storminess
and one model projects a decrease. A common deficiency among many
AR4 models is a coarsely resolved stratosphere and there are still
concerns that this may lead to systematic biases in the Atlantic storm
track response to increased anthropogenic forcing (Scaife et al., 2011).
A reduction in cyclone frequency along the Canadian east coast hasbeen reported (Bengtsson et al., 2006; Watterson, 2006; Pinto et al.,2007a; Teng et al., 2008; Long et al., 2009). New results for Southern
Hemisphere cyclones confirm the previously projected poleward shift in
storm tracks under increased greenhouse gases (Lim and Simmonds,2009). That study projected a reduction of Southern Hemisphereextratropical cyclone frequency and intensity in mid-latitudes but a
slight increase at high latitudes. The poleward shift due to increased
greenhouse gases may be partly opposed by ozone recovery (Son et al.,
2010).Detailed analyses of changes in physical mechanisms related to cyclone
changes in coupled climate models are still few. O’Gorman (2010) showedthat changes in mean available potential energy of the atmosphere canaccount for much of the varied response in storm-track intensity toglobal warming, implying that changes in storm-track intensity aresensitive to competing effects of changes in temperature gradients andstatic stability in different atmospheric levels. Using two coupled climatemodels, Laine et al. (2009) indicate that the primary cause for synopticactivity changes at the western end of the Northern Hemisphere stormtracks is related to the baroclinic conversion processes linked to meantemperature gradient changes in localized regions of the western
oceanic basins. They also found downstream changes in latent heat
release during the developing and mature stages of the cyclone to be ofimportance and indicated that changes in diabatic process may beamplified by the upstream baroclinic changes [stronger (weaker)baroclinic activity in the west gives stronger (weaker) latent heatrelease downstream]. Pinto et al. (2009) found that regional increasesin track density and intensity of extreme cyclones close to the BritishIsles using a single model was associated with an eastward shift of thejet stream into Europe, more frequent extreme values of baroclinicity,and stronger upper level divergence.
The modeled reduction in Southern Hemisphere extratropical cyclone
frequency and intensity in the mid-latitudes has been attributed to thetropical upper tropospheric warming enhancing static stability anddecreasing baroclinicity while an increased meridional temperaturegradient in the high latitudes is suggested to be responsible for theincrease in cyclone activity in this region (Lim and Simmonds, 2009). Inaddition to details in the modeled changes in local baroclinicity anddiabatic changes, the geographical pattern of modeled response incyclone activity has been reported to be influenced by the individualmodel’s structure of intrinsic modes of variability (Branstator and Selten,2009) and biases in the climatology (Kidston and Gerber, 2010).
In summary it is likely that there has been a poleward shift in the
main Northern and Southern Hemisphere extratropical stormtracks during the last 50 years. There is medium confidence in an
anthropogenic influence on this observed poleward shift. It hasnot formally been attributed. There is low confidence in past
changes in regional intensity. There is medium confidence that
an increased anthropogenic forcing will lead to a reduction in thenumber of mid-latitude cyclones averaged over each hemisphere,and there is also medium confidence in a poleward shift of the
tropospheric storm tracks due to future anthropogenic forcings.Regional changes may be substantial and CMIP3 simulations showsome regions with medium agreement. However, there are stilluncertainties related to how the poorly resolved stratosphere inmany CMIP3 models may influence the regional results. In addition,studies using different analysis techniques, different physicalquantities, different thresholds, and different atmospheric verticallevels to represent cyclone activity and storm tracks result indifferent projections of regional changes. This leads to low
confidence in region-specific projections.

Natural Physical Environment
3.5.1. Droughts
Drought is generally “a period of abnormally dry weather long enough to
cause a serious hydrological imbalance” (see the Glossary and Box 3-3).While lack of precipitation (i.e., meteorological drought; Box 3-3) is oftenthe primary cause of drought, increased potential evapotranspiration
induced by enhanced radiation, wind speed, or vapor pressure deficit (itself
linked to temperature and relative humidity), as well as pre-conditioning(pre-event soil moisture; la ke, snow, and/or groundwater storage)
can contribute to the emergence of soil moisture and hydrologicaldrought (Box 3-3). Actual evapotranspiration is additionally controlledby soil moisture, which constitutes a limiting factor for further dryingunder drought conditions, and other processes that impact vegetationdevelopment and phenology (e.g., temperature) are also relevant. As
noted in the AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007), there are few direct observationsof drought-related variables, in particular of soil moisture, available fora global analysis (see also Section 3.2.1). Hence, proxies for drought(‘drought indices’) are often used to infer changes in drought conditions.
Box 3-3 provides a discussion of the issue of drought definition and adescription of commonly used drought indices. In order to understand theimpact of droughts (e.g., on crop yields, general ecosystem functioning,water resources, and electricity production), their timing, duration,intensity, and spatial extent need to be characterized. Several weather
elements may interact to increase the impact of droughts: enhanced air
temperature can indirectly lead to enhanced evaporative demand(through enhanced vapor pressure deficit), although enhanced windspeed or increased incoming radiation are generally more importantfactors. Moreover, climate phenomena such as monsoons (Section 3.4.1)and ENSO (Section 3.4.2) affect changes in drought occurrence in someChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
Box 3-3 | The Definition of Drought
Though a commonly used term, drought is defined in various ways, and these definitional issues make the analysis of changes indrought characteristics difficult. This explains why assessments of (past or projected) changes in drought can substantially di ffer between
published studies or chosen indices (see Section 3.5.1). Some of these difficulties and their causes are highlighted in this bo x.
What is Drought or Dryness?
The Glossary defines drought as follows: “ A period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbala nce.
Drought is a relative term, therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit must refer to the particular precipitati on-related
activity that is under discussion. For example, shortage of precipitation during the growing season impinges on crop production  or
ecosystem function in general (due to soil moisture drought, also termed agricultural drought), and during the runoff and perco lation
season primarily affects water supplies (hydrological drought). Storage changes in soil moisture and groundwater are also affec ted by
increases in actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in precipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation defi cit is
defined as a meteorological drought. A megadrought is a very lengthy and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal, us ually a
decade or more.”
As highlighted in the above definition, drought can be defined from different perspectives, depending on the stakeholders invol ved. The
scientific literature commonly distinguishes meteorological drought , which refers to a deficit of precipitation, soil moisture drought
(often called agricultural drought ), which refers to a deficit of (mostly root zone) soil moisture, and hydrological drought , which refers to
negative anomalies in streamflow, la ke, and/or groundwater levels (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002). We use here the term ‘soil moisture drought’
instead of ‘agricultural drought,’ despite the widespread use of the latter term (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002; Wang, 2005), because so il moisture
deficits have several additional effects beside those on agroecosystems, most importantly on other natural or managed ecosystem s
(including both forests and pastures), on building infrastructure through soil mechanical processes (e.g., Corti et al., 2009),  and health
through impacts on heat waves (Section 3.1.4). Water scarcity (linked to socioeconomic drought ), which may be caused fully or in part
by use from human activities, does not lie within the scope of this chapter (see Section 4.2.2); however, it should be noted th at changing
pressure on water resources by human uses may itself influence climate and possibly the drought conditions, for example, via de clining
groundwater levels, or enhanced local evapotranspiration and associated land-atmosphere feedbacks. Drought should not be confus ed
with aridity, which describes the general characteristic of an arid climate (e.g., desert). Indeed, drought is considered a rec urring feature
of climate occurring in any region and is defined with respect to the average climate of the given region (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002 ; Dai, 2011).
Nonetheless, the effects of droughts are not linear, given the existence of, for example, discrete soil moisture thresholds aff ecting
vegetation and surface fluxes (e.g., Koster et al., 2004b; Seneviratne et al., 2010), which means that the same precipitation d eficit or
radiation excess relative to normal will not affect different regions equally (e.g., short-term lack of precipitation in a very  humid region
may not be critical for agriculture because of the ample soil moisture supply). In this chapter we often use the term ‘dryness’  instead of
‘drought’ as a more general term.

Drought Drivers
For soil moisture or hydrological droughts, the main drivers are reduced precipitation and/or increased evapotranspiration (Fig ure 3-9).
Although the role of deficits in precipitation is generally considered more prominently in the literature, several drought indi cators also
explicitly or indirectly consider effects of evapotranspiration. In the context of climate projections, analyses suggest that c hanges in
simulated soil moisture drought are mostly driven by changes in precipitation, with increased evapotranspiration from higher va por pres sure
deficit (often linked to increased temperature) and available radiation modulating some of the changes (e.g., Burke and Brown, 2008;
Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). It should nonetheless be noted that under strong drought conditions , soil
moisture becomes limiting for evapotranspiration, thus limits further soil moisture depletion. Other important aspects for soil  moisture
and hydrological droughts are persistence and pre-conditioning. Because soil moisture, groundwater, and surface waters are asso ciated
with water storage, they have a characteristic memory (e.g., Vinnikov et al., 1996; Eltahir and Yeh, 1999; Koster and Suarez, 2 001;
Seneviratne et al., 2006b) and thus specific response times to drought forcing (e.g., Begueria et al., 2010; Fleig et al., 2011 ). The memory
is also a function of the atmospheric forcing and system’ s feed backs
(Koster and Suarez, 2001; A.H. Wang et al., 2009), and the relevantstorage is dependent on soil characteristics and rooting depth ofthe considered ecosystems. This means that drought has a differentpersistence depending on the affected system, and that it is alsosensitive to pre-conditioning (Figure 3-9). Effects of pre-conditioningalso explain the possible occurrence of multi-year droughts, wherebysoil moisture anomalies can be carried over from one year to thenext (e.g., Wang, 2005). However, other features can inducedrought persistence, such as persistent circulation anomalies,possibly strengthened by land-atmosphere feedbacks (Schubert etal., 2004; Rowell and Jones, 2006). The choice of variable (e.g.,precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow) and time scale canstrongly affect the ranking of drought events (Vidal et al., 2010).
Drought Indices
Because of the complex definition of droughts, and the lack of soil moisture observations (Section 3.2.1), several indices have  been
developed to characterize (meteorological, soil moisture, and hydrological) drought (see, e.g., Heim Jr., 2002; Dai, 2011). The se indicators
include land surface, hydrological, or climate model simulations (providing estimates of, e.g., soil moisture or runoff) and in dices based
on measured meteorological or hydrological variables. We provide here a brief overview of the wide range of drought indices use d in the
literature for the analysis of recent and projected changes. Note that information on paleoclimate proxies such as tree rings,speleothems, lake sediments, or historical evidence (e.g., harvest dates) is not detailed here.
Some indices are based solely on precipitation data. A widely used index is the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al ., 1993;
Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders, 2002), which consists of fitting and transforming a long-term precipitation record into a normal dis tribution
that has zero mean and unit standard deviation. SPI values of -0.5 to -1 correspond to mild droughts, -1 to -1.5 to moderate dr oughts,
-1.5 to -2 to severe droughts, and below -2 to extreme droughts. Similarly, values from 0 to 2 correspond to mildly wet to seve rely wet
conditions, and values above 2 to extremely wet conditions (Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders, 2002). SPI can be computed over several time
scales (e.g., 3, 6, 12, or more months) and thus indirectly considers effects of accumulating precipitation deficits, which are  critical for
soil moisture and hydrological droughts. Another index commonly used in the analysis of climate model simulations is the Consec utive
Dry Days (CDD) index, which considers the maximum consecutive number of days without rain (i.e., below a given threshold, typic ally
1 mm day
-1) within a considered period (i.e., year in general; Frich et al., 2002; Alexander et al., 2006; Tebaldi et al., 2006). For sea sonal
time frames, the CDD periods can either be considered to be bound to the respective seasons (e.g., Figure 3-10) or considered i n their
entirety (across seasons) but assigned to a specific season. Though SPI and CDD are both only based on precipitation, they do n ot
necessarily only consider the effects of meteorological drought, since periods without rain (thus less cloud cover) are bound t o have
higher daytime radiation forcing and generally higher temperatures, thus possibly positive evapotranspiration anomalies (unless  soil
moisture conditions are too dry and limit evapotranspiration). 
Some indices reflect both precipitation and estimates of actual or potential evapotranspiration, in some cases also accounting for some
temporal accumulation of the forcings or persistence of the drought anomalies. These include the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)

(Palmer, 1965), which measures the departure of moisture balance from normal conditions using a simple water balance model (e.g ., Dai,
2011), as well as other indices such as the Precipitation Potential Evaporation Anomaly (PPEA, based on the cumulative differen ce
between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) used in Burke and Brown (2008) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, which considers cumulated anomalies of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) describe d in
Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010). PDSI has been widely used for decades (in particular in the United States), and also in climate change
analyses (e.g., Dai et al., 2004; Burke and Brown, 2008; Dai, 2011); however, it has some shortcomings for climate change monit oring
and projection. PDSI was originally calibrated for the central United States, which can impair the comparability of the index a cross
regions (and also across time periods if drought mechanisms change over time). Thus it is often of advantage to renormalize the  local
PDSI (Dai, 2011), which can also be done using the self-calibrated PDSI (Wells et al., 2004), but several studies do not apply these steps.
Moreover, the land surface model underlying the computation of the PDSI is essentially a simple bucket-type model, which is les s
sophisticated than more recent land surface and hydrological models and thus implies several limitations (e.g., Dai et al., 200 4; Burke et
al., 2006). Another important issue is that the parameterization of potential evapotranspiration as empirically (and solely) de pendent on
air temperature, which is often applied for these various indices (e.g., in the study of Dai et al., 2004) can lead to biased r esults (e.g.,
Donohue et al., 2010; Milly and Dunne, 2011; Shaw and Riha, 2011). Temperature is only an indirect driver of evapotranspiration , via its
effect on vapor pressure deficit and via effects on vegetation phenology. Furthermore, approaches using potential evapotranspir ation as
a proxy for actual evapotranspiration do not consider soil moisture and vegetation control on evapotranspiration, which are imp ortant
mechanisms limiting drought development.
For the assessment of soil moisture drought, simulated soil moisture anomalies also can be considered (Wang et al., 2005; Burke  and
Brown, 2008; Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; A.H. Wang et al., 2009; Dai, 2011; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2011). Simulated soil mois ture
anomalies integrate the effects of precipitation forcing, simulated actual evapotranspiration (resulting from atmospheric forci ng and
simulated soil moisture limitation on evapotranspiration), and simulated soil moisture persistence. Although the soil moisture simulated
by (land-surface, hydrological, and climate) models often exhibits strong discrepancies in absolute terms, soil moisture anomal ies can be
compared with simple scaling and generally match reasonably well (e.g., Koster et al., 2009; A.H. Wang et al., 2009). Soil mois ture
persistence is found to be an important component in projected changes in soil moisture drought, with some regions displaying y ear-
round dryness compared to reference (late 20th or pre-industrial) conditions due to the carry-over effect of soil moisture stor age from
season to season, leading to year-round soil moisture deficits compared to late 20th century climate (e.g., Wang et al., 2005, Figure 3-10).
However, it should be noted that some land surface and hydrological models (used offline or coupled to climate models) suffer f rom
similar shortcomings as noted above for PDSI – that is, they use simple bucket models or simplified representations of potentialevapotranspiration. The latter issue has been suggested as being particularly critical for models used in offline mode (Milly a nd Dunne,
2011). Nonetheless, for the assessment of soil moisture drought, using simulated soil moisture anomalies seems less problematic  than
many other indices for the reasons highlighted in the above paragraphs.
The indices listed above have been used in various studies analyzing drought in the context of climate change, but with a few e xceptions
most available studies are based only on one index, which makes their comparison difficult. Nonetheless, these studies suggest that
projections can be highly dependent on the choice of drought index. For instance, one study projected changes in drought area p ossibly
varying between a negligible impact and a 5 to 45% increase depending on the drought index considered (Burke and Brown, 2008).
Other drought indices are used to quantify hydrological drought (e.g., Heim Jr., 2002; Vidal et al., 2010; Dai, 2011), but are less
commonly used in climate change studies. Further analyses or indices also consider the area affected by droughts (e.g., Burke e t al.,
2006; Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; Dai, 2011) or additional variables (such as snow or vegetation indices from satellite measurem ents,
e.g., Heim Jr., 2002). As for the definition of other indices (Box 3-1), the determination of the reference period is critical for the assessment
of changes in drought patterns independently of the chosen index. In general, late 20th-century conditions are used as referenc e (e.g.,
Figure 3-10). 
In summary, drought indices often integrate precipitation, temperature, and other variables, but may emphasize different
aspects of drought and should be carefully selected with respect to the drought characteristic in mind. In particular, someindices have specific shortcomings, especially in the context of climate change. For this reason, assessments of changes in
drought characteristics with climate change should consider several indices including a specific evaluation of their relevance
to the addressed question to support robust conclusions. In this assessment we focus on the following indices: consecutive
dry days (CDD) and simulated soil moisture anomalies (SMA), although evidence based on other indices (e.g., PDSI forpresent climate) is also considered (Section 3.5.1; Tables 3-2 and 3-3).170regions. Hence, drought is a complex phenomenon that is strongly
affected by other extremes considered in this chapter, but that is alsoaffected by changes in mean climate features (Section 3.1.6). In addition,
via land-atmosphere interactions, drought also has the potential to
impact other weather and climate elements such as temperature andprecipitation and associated extremes (Koster et al., 2004b; Seneviratne
et al., 2006a; Hirschi et al., 2011; see also Section 3.1.4). Case Study 9.2.3addresses aspects related to the management of adverse consequencesof droughts; while Case Study 9.2.2 considers the possible impacts ofhigh temperatures and drought on wildfire.
Observed Changes
There are still large uncertainties regarding observed global-scale trends indroughts. The AR4 reported based on analyses using PDSI (see Box 3-3)that very dry areas had more than doubled in extent since 1970 at theglobal scale (Trenberth et al., 2007). This assessment was, however,largely based on the study by Dai et al. (2004) only. These trends in thePDSI proxy were found to be largely affected by changes in temperature,not precipitation (Dai et al., 2004). On the other hand, based on soilmoisture simulations with an observation-driven land surface model forthe time period 1950-2000, Sheffield and Wood (2008a) have inferredtrends in drought duration, intensity, and severity predominantlydecreasing, but with strong regional variation and including increases insome regions. They concluded that there was an overall moistening trendover the considered time period, but also a switch since the 1970s to adrying trend, globally and in many regions, especially in high northernlatitudes. Some regional studies are consistent with the results fromSheffield and Wood (2008a), regarding, for example, less widespreadincrease (or statistically insignificant changes or decreases) in someregions compared to the study of Dai et al. (2004) (e.g., in Europe, seebelow). More recently, Dai (2011) by extending the record did, however,find widespread increases in drought both based on various versions ofPDSI (for 1950-2008) and soil moisture output from a land surface model(for 1948-2004). Hence there are still large uncertainties with respect toglobal assessments of past changes in droughts. Nonetheless, there issome agreement between studies over the different time frames (i.e.,
since 1950 versus 1970) and using different drought indicators regardingincreasing drought occurrence in some regions (e.g., southern Europe,
West Africa; see below and Table 3-2), although other regions also indicateopposite trends (e.g., central North America, northwestern Australia; see
below and Table 3-2). As mentioned in Section 3.1.6, spatially coherent
shifts in drought regimes are expected with changing global circulation
patterns. Table 3-2 provides regional and continental-scale assessmentsof observed trends in dryness based on different indices (Box 3-3). Thefollowing paragraphs provide more details by continent.
From a paleoclimate perspective recent droughts are not unprecedented,
with severe ‘megadroughts’ reported in the paleoclimatic record for
Europe, North America, and Australia (Jansen et al., 2007). Recent studiesextend this observation to African and Indian droughts (Sinha et al.,2007; Shanahan et al., 2009): much more severe and longer droughtsoccurred in the past centuries with widespread ecological, political, and
socioeconomic consequences. Overall, these studies confirm that in thelast millennium several extreme droughts have occurred (Breda andBadeau, 2008; Kallis, 2008; Büntgen et al., 2010). 
In North America, there is medium confidence that there has been an
overall slight tendency toward less dryness (wetting trend with more soilmoisture and runoff; Table 3-2), although analyses for some subregionsalso indicate tendencies toward increasing dryness. This assessment is
based on several lines of evidence, including simulations with different
hydrological models as well as PDSI and CDD estimates (Alexander etal., 2006; Andreadis and Lettenmaier, 2006; van der Schrier et al., 2006a;Kunkel et al., 2008; Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; Dai, 2011). The mostsevere droughts in the 20th century have occurred in the 1930s and1950s, where the 1930s Dust Bowl was most intense and the 1950sdrought most persistent (Andreadis et al., 2005) in the United States,while in Mexico the 1950s and late 1990s were the driest periods.Recent regional trends toward more severe drought conditions wereidentified over southern and western Canada, Alaska, and Mexico, withsubregional exceptions (Dai, 2011). 
In Europe, there is medium confidence regarding increases in dryness
based on some indices in the southern part of the continent, but largeinconsistencies between indices in this region, and inconsistent orstatistically insignificant trends in the rest of the continent (Table 3-2).Although Dai et al. (2004) found an increase in dryness for most of theEuropean continent based on PDSI, Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders (2002)and van der Schrier et al. (2006b) concluded, based on the analysis ofSPI and self-calibrating PDSI for the 20th century (for 1901-1999 and1901-2002, respectively), that no statistically significant changes wereobserved in extreme and moderate drought conditions in Europe [withthe exception of the Mediterranean region in van der Schrier et al.(2006b)]. Sheffield and Wood (2008a) also found contrasting drynesstrends in Europe, with increases in the southern and eastern part of thecontinent, but decreases elsewhere. Beniston (2009b) reported a strongincrease in warm-dry conditions over all central-southern (includingmaritime) Europe via a quartile analysis from the middle to the end ofthe 20th century. Alexander et al. (2006) found trends toward increasingCDD mostly in the southern and central part of the continent. Trends ofdecreasing precipitation and discharge are consistent with increasingsalinity in the Mediterranean Sea, indicating a trend toward freshwaterdeficits (Mariotti et al., 2008), but this could also be partly caused byincreased human water use. In France, an analysis based on a variationof the PDSI model also reported a significant increasing trend in droughtconditions, in particular from the 1990s onward (Corti et al., 2009).Stahl et al. (2010) investigated streamflow data across Europe andfound negative trends (lower streamflow) in southern and easternregions, and generally positive trends (higher streamflow) elsewhere(especially in northern latitudes). Low flows have decreased in mostregions where the lowest mean monthly flow occurs in summer, butvary for catchments that have flow minima in winter and secondary lowflows in summer. The exceptional 2003 summer heat wave on theEuropean continent (see Section 3.3.1) was also associated with a
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment171major soil moisture drought, as could be inferred from satellite
measurements (Andersen et al., 2005), model simulations (Fischer et al.,2007a,b), and impacts on ecosystems (Ciais et al., 2005; Reichstein etal., 2007). 
There is low confidence in dryness trends in South America (Table 3-2),
partly due to lack of data and partly due to inconsistencies. For theAmazon, repeated intense droughts have been occurring in the lastdecades but no particular trend has been reported. The 2005 and 2010droughts in Amazonia are, however, considered the strongest in the lastcentury as inferred from integrating precipitation records and waterstorage estimates via satellite (measurements from the GravityRecovery and Climate Experiment; Chen et al., 2009; Lewis et al., 2011).For other parts of South America, analyses of the return intervalsbetween droughts in the instrumental and reconstructed precipitationseries indicate that the probability of drought has increased during thelate 19th and 20th centuries, consistent with selected long instrumentalprecipitation records and with a recession of glaciers in the Chilean andArgentinean Andean Cordillera (Le Quesne et al., 2006, 2009). 
Changes in drought patterns have been reported for the monsoon regions
of Asia and Africa with variations at the decadal time scale (e.g., Janicot,2009). In Asia there is overall low confidence in trends in dryness both
at the continental and regional scale, mostly due to spatially varyingtrends, except in East Asia where a range of studies, based on differentindices, show increasing dryness in the second half of the 20th century,leading to medium confidence (Table 3-2). 
In the Sahel, recent years have been characterized by greater interannual
variability than the previous 40 years (Ali and Lebel, 2009; Greene et al.,2009), and by a contrast between the western Sahel remaining dry andthe eastern Sahel returning to wetter conditions (Ali and Lebel, 2009).Giannini et al. (2008) report a drying of the African monsoon regions,related to warming of the tropical oceans, and variability related to ENSO.In the different subregions of Africa there is overall lowto medium
confidence regarding regional dryness trends (Table 3-2).
For Australia, Sheffield and Wood (2008a) found very limited increases
in dryness from 1950 to 2000 based on soil moisture simulated using
existing climate forcing (mostly in southeastern Australia) and somemarked decreases in dryness in central Australia and the northwestern
part of the continent. Dai (2011), for an extended period until 2008 andusing different PDSI variants as well as soil moisture output from a landsurface model, found a more extended drying trend in the eastern halfof the continent, but also a decrease in dryness in most of the western
half. Jung et al. (2010) inferred from a combination of remote sensing
and quasi-globally distributed eddy covariance flux observations that in
particular the decade after 1998 became drier in Australia (and parts ofAfrica and South America), leading to decreased evapotranspiration, butit is not clear if this is a trend or just decadal variation.
Following the assessment of observed changes in the AR4 (Chapter 3),
which was largely based on one study (Dai et al., 2004), subsequentwork has drawn a more differentiated picture both regionally and
temporally. There is not enough evidence at present to suggest highconfidence in observed trends in dryness due to lack of direct observa tions,
some geographical inconsistencies in the trends, and some dependenciesof inferred trends on the index choice. There is medium confidence that
since the 1950s some regions of the world have experienced moreintense and longer droughts (e.g., southern Europe, west Africa) butalso opposite trends exist in other regions (e.g., central North America,northwestern Australia). 
Causes of the Observed Changes
The AR4 (Hegerl et al., 2007) concluded that it is more likely than not
that anthropogenic influence has contributed to the increase in thedroughts observed in the second half of the 20th century. This assessmentwas based on several lines of evidence, including a detection study thatidentified an anthropogenic fingerprint in a global PDSI data set withhigh significance (Burke et al., 2006), although the model trend wasweaker than observed and the relative contributions of natural externalforcings and anthropogenic forcings were not assessed.
There is now a better understanding of the potential role of land-
atmosphere feedbacks versus SST forcing for meteorological droughts(e.g., Schubert et al., 2008a,b), and some modeling studies have alsoaddressed potential impacts of land use changes (e.g., Deo et al., 2009),but large uncertainties remain in the field of land surface modeling andland-atmosphere interactions, in part due to lack of observations(Seneviratne et al., 2010), inter-model discrepancies (Koster et al., 2004b;Dirmeyer et al., 2006; Pitman et al., 2009), and model resolution oforographic and other effects. Nonetheless, a new set of climate modelingstudies show that US drought response to SST variability is consistentwith observations (Schubert et al., 2009). Inferred trends in drought arealso consistent with trends in global precipitation and temperature, andthe latter two are consistent with expected responses to anthropogenicforcing (Hegerl et al., 2007; X. Zhang et al., 2007). The change in the patternof global precipitation in the observations and in model simulations isalso consistent with the theoretical understanding of hydrologicalresponse to global warming that wet regions become overall wetterand dry regions drier in a warming world (Held and Soden, 2006; seealso Section 3.1.6), though some regions also display shifts in climateregimes (Section 3.1.6). Nonetheless, some single events have beenreported as differing from projections (Seager et al., 2009), though this isnot necessarily incompatible given the superimposition of anthropogenicclimate change and natural climate variability (Section 3.1). For soilmoisture and hydrological drought it has been suggested that thestomatal ‘antitranspirant’ responses of plants to rising atmospheric CO
2
may lead to a decrease in evapotranspiration (Gedney et al., 2006). Thiscould mean that increasing CO
2levels alleviate soil moisture and
streamflow drought, but this result is still debated (e.g., Piao et al.,2007; Gerten et al., 2008), in particular due to the uncertainty inobserved runoff trends used to infer these effects (e.g., Peel andMcMahon, 2006; see also Section 3.2.1).Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment172Overall, though new studies have furthered the understanding of the
mechanisms leading to drought, there is still relatively limited evidenceto provide an attribution of observed changes, in particular given theissues associated with the availability of observational data (Section 3.2.1)and the definition and computation of drought indicators (Box 3-3). Thislatter point was mostly identified in post-AR4 studies (Box 3-3). Moreover,regions where consistent increases in drought are identified (see ‘ObservedChanges’) are only partly consistent with those where projections indicate
an enhancement of drought conditions in coming decades (see nextparagraphs). We thus assess that there is medium confidence (see also
Section 3.1.5) that anthropogenic influence has contributed to somechanges in the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20thcentury, based on its attributed impact on precipitation and temperaturechanges (though temperature can only be indirectly related to droughttrends; see Box 3-3). However there is low confidence in the attribution
of changes in droughts at the level of individual regions.
Projected Changes and Uncertainties
The AR4 assessed that projections at the time indicated an increase indroughts, in particular in subtropical and mid-latitude areas(Christensen et al., 2007). An increase in dry spell length and frequencywas considered very likely over the Mediterranean region, southern
areas of Australia, and New Zealand and likely over most subtropical
regions, with little change over northern Europe. Continental drying andthe associated risk of drought were considered likely to increase in
summer over many mid-latitude continental interiors (e.g., central andsouthern Europe, the Mediterranean region), in boreal spring, and dryperiods of the annual cycle over Central America. 
More recent global and regional climate simulations and hydrological
models mostly support the projections from the AR4, as summarized in thefollowing paragraphs (see also Table 3-3), although we assess the overallconfidence in drought projections as medium given the definitional
issues associated with dryness and the partial lack of agreement inmodel projections when based on different dryness indices (Box 3-3).Indeed, particular care is needed in inter-comparing ‘drought’ projectionssince very many different definitions are employed (corresponding to
different types of droughts), from simple climatic indices such as CDD
to more complex indices of soil moisture and hydrological drought (Box
3-3). A distinction also needs to be made between short-term and
longer-term events. Blenkinsop and Fowler (2007a) and Burke et al.
(2010), for example, show different trend strength, and sometimes sign(Blenkinsop and Fowler, 2007a), for changes in short- and long-termdroughts with RCM ensembles applied to the United Kingdom(although uncertainties in the latter projections are large; see below).
These various distinctions are generally not considered and mostcurrently available studies only assess changes in very few (mostcommonly one or two) dryness indices.
On the global scale, Burke and Brown (2008) provided an analysis of
projected changes in drought based on four indices (SPI, PDSI, PPEA,and SMA; for definitions, see Box 3-3) using two model ensembles: one
based on a GCM expressing uncertainty in parameter space, and a multi-model ensemble of 11 GCM simulations from CMIP3. Their analysisrevealed that SPI, based solely on precipitation, showed little change inthe proportion of the land surface in drought, and that all other indices,which include a measure of the atmospheric demand for moisture,showed a statistically significant increase with an additional 5 to 45% ofthe land surface in drought. This study also highlighted large uncertaintiesin regional changes in drought. For reasons highlighted in Box 3-3, usingsimulated soil moisture anomalies from the climate models avoids someshortcomings of other commonly used indices (although the quality ofsimulated soil moisture cannot be well evaluated due to lack ofobservations; Section 3.2 and Box 3-3). In the study of Burke and Brown(2008), this index showed weaker drying compared to PDSI and PPEAindices (but more pronounced drying than the SPI index). In this report,we display projected changes in soil moisture anomalies and CDD(Figure 3-10), this latter index being chosen for continuity with the AR4(see Figure 10.18 of that report). It can be seen that the two indicespartly agree on increased drought in some large regions (e.g., on theannual time scale, in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean region,central Europe, central North America, Central America and Mexico,northeast Brazil, and southern Africa), but some regions where the modelsshow consistent increases in CDD (e.g., southeast Asia) do not showconsistent decreases in soil moisture. Conversely, regions displaying aconsistent decrease in CDD (e.g., in northeastern Asia) do not show aconsistent increase in soil moisture. The substantial uncertainty of droughtprojections is particularly clear from the soil moisture projections, with,for example, no agreement among the models regarding the sign ofchanges in December to February over most of the globe. These resultsregarding changes in CDD and soil moisture are consistent with otherpublished studies (Wang, 2005; Tebaldi et al., 2006; Burke and Brown,2008; Sheffield and Wood, 2008b; Sillmann and Roeckner, 2008) and theareas that display consistent increasing drought tendencies for bothindices have also been reported to display such tendencies for additionalindices (e.g., Burke and Brown, 2008; Dai, 2011; Table 3-3). Sheffield andWood (2008b) examined projections in drought frequency (for droughtsof duration of 4 to 6 months and longer than 12 months, estimated fromsoil moisture anomalies) based on CMIP3 simulations with eight GCMsand the SRES scenarios A2, A1B, and B1. They concluded that drought wasprojected to increase in several regions under these three scenarios(mostly consistent with those displayed in Figure 3-10 for SMA),although the projections of drought intensification were stronger for thehigh CO
2emissions scenarios (A2 and A1B) than for the more moderate
scenario (B1). Regions showing statistically significant increases in droughtfrequency were found to be broadly similar for all three scenarios,despite the more moderate signal in the B1 scenario (their Figures 8 and9). This study also highlighted the large uncertainty of scenarios fordrought projections, as scenarios were found to span a large range ofchanges in drought frequency in most regions, from close to no changeto two- to three-fold increases (their Figure 10).
Regional climate simulations and high-resolution global atmospheric
model simulations over Europe also highlight the Mediterranean regionChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment173Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment

Seneviratne (2011); updating Tebaldi et al. (2006) for SMA and for additional CMIP3 models, and including seasonal time frames.  For more details, see Appendix 3.A.174as being affected by more severe droughts, consistent with available
global projections (Table 3-3; see also Giorgi, 2006; Rowell and Jones,2006; Beniston et al., 2007; Mariotti et al., 2008; Planton et al., 2008).Mediterranean (summer) droughts are projected to start earlier in theyear and last longer. Also, increased variability during the dry and warmseason is projected (Giorgi, 2006). One GCM-based study projected oneto three weeks of additional dry days for the Mediterranean region bythe end of the century (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009). For North America,intense and heavy episodic rainfall events with high runoff amountsare interspersed with longer relatively dry periods with increasedevapotranspiration, particularly in the subtropics. There is a consensus ofmost climate model projections for a reduction in cool season precipitationacross the US southwest and northwest Mexico (Christensen et al., 2007),with more frequent multi-year drought in the US southwest (Seager et al.,2007; Cayan et al., 2010). Reduced cool season precipitation promotesdrier summer conditions by reducing the amount of soil water availablefor evapotranspiration in summer. For Australia, Alexander and Arblaster(2009) project increases in consecutive dry days, although consensusbetween models is only found in the interior of the continent. Africanstudies indicate the possibility of relatively small-scale (500-km)heterogeneity of changes in precipitation and drought, based on climatemodel simulations (Funk et al., 2008; Shongwe et al., 2009). Regionalclimate simulations of South America project spatially coherent increasesin CDD, particularly large over the Brazilian Plateau, and northern Chileand the Altiplano (Kitoh et al., 2011).
Available global and regional studies of hydrological drought (Hirabayashi
et al., 2008b; Feyen and Dankers, 2009) project a higher likelihood ofhydrological drought by the end of this century, with a substantialincrease in the number of drought days (defined as streamflow below aspecific threshold) during the last 30 years of the 21st century overNorth and South America, central and southern Africa, the Middle East,southern Asia from Indochina to southern China, and central and westernAustralia. Some regions, including eastern Europe to central Eurasia,inland China, and northern North America, project increases in drought.In contrast, wide areas over eastern Russia project a decrease in droughtdays. At least in Europe, hydrological drought is primarily projected tooccur in the frost-free season.
Increased confidence in modeling drought stems from consistency
between models and satisfactory simulation of drought indices during
the past century (Sheffield and Wood, 2008a; Sillmann and Roeckner,
2008). Inter-model agreement is stronger for long-term droughts andlarger spatial scales (in some regions, see above discussion), while local toregional and short-term precipitation deficits are highly spatially variableand much less consistent between models (Blenkinsop and Fowler,
2007b). Insufficient knowledge of the physical causes of meteorological
droughts, and of the links to the large-scale atmospheric and ocean
circulation, is still a source of uncertainty in drought simulations and
projections. For example, plausible explanations have been proposed for
projections of both a worsening drought and a substantial increase in
rainfall in the Sahara (Biasutti et al., 2009; Burke et al., 2010). Another
example is illustrated with the relationship of rainfall in southernAustralia with SSTs around northern Australia. On annual time scales,
low rainfall is associated with cooler than normal SSTs. Yet the warmingobserved in SST over the past few decades has not been associated withincreased rainfall, but with a trend toward more drought-like conditions(N. Nicholls, 2010). 
There are still further sources of uncertainties affecting the projections
of trends in meteorological drought for the coming century. The twomost important may be uncertainties in the development of the oceancirculation and feedbacks between land surface and atmosphericprocesses. These latter processes are related to the effects of drought on
vegetation physiology and dynamics (e.g., affecting canopy conductance,
albedo, and roughness), with resulting (positive or negative) feedbacksto precipitation formation (Findell and Eltahir, 2003a,b; Koster et al.,2004b; Cook et al., 2006; Hohenegger et al., 2009; Seneviratne et al.,2010; van den Hurk and van Meijgaard, 2010), and possibly – as onlyrecently highlighted – also feedbacks between droughts, fires, andaerosols (Bevan et al., 2009). Furthermore, the development of soilmoisture that results from complex interactions among precipitation,water storage as soil moisture (and snow), and evapotranspiration byvegetation is still associated with large uncertainties, in particularbecause of lack of observations of soil moisture and evapotranspiration(Section 3.2.1), and issues in the representation of soil moisture-evapotranspiration coupling in current climate models (Dirmeyer et al.,2006; Seneviratne et al., 2010). Uncertainties regarding soil moisture-climate interactions are also due to uncertainties regarding the behaviorof plant transpiration, growth, and water use efficiency under enhancedatmospheric CO
2concentrations, which could potentially have impacts
on the hydrological cycle (Betts et al., 2007), but are not well understoodyet (Hungate et al., 2003; Piao et al., 2007; Bonan, 2008; Teuling et al.,2009; see also above discussion on the causes of observed changes).The space-time development of hydrological drought as a response to ameteorological drought and the associated soil moisture drought(drought propagation, e.g., Peters et al., 2003) also needs more attention.There is some understanding of these issues at the catchment scale(e.g., Tallaksen et al., 2009), but these need to be extended to theregional and continental scales. This would lead to better understandingof the projections of hydrological droughts, which would contribute toa better identification and attribution of droughts and help to improveglobal hydrological models and land surface models.
In summary, there is medium confidence that since the 1950s
some regions of the world have experienced trends toward moreintense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europeand West Africa, but in some regions droughts have become lessfrequent, less intense, or shorter, for example, central NorthAmerica and northwestern Australia. There is medium confidence
that anthropogenic influence has contributed to some changesin the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20thcentury, based on its attributed impact on precipitation andtemperature changes (though temperature can only be indirectlyrelated to drought trends; see Box 3-3). However there is low
confidence in the attribution of changes in droughts at the levelChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment175of single regions due to inconsistent or insufficient evidence.
Post-AR4 studies indicate that there is medium confidence in a
projected increase in duration and intensity of droughts in someregions of the world, including southern Europe and theMediterranean region, central Europe, central North America,Central America and Mexico, northeast Brazil, and southernAfrica. Elsewhere there is overall low confidence because of
insufficient agreement of projections of drought changes(dependent both on model and dryness index). Definitionalissues and lack of data preclude higher confidence than medium
in observations of drought changes, while these issues plus theinability of models to include all the factors likely to influencedroughts preclude stronger confidence than medium in the
projections.
3.5.2. Floods
A flood is “the overflowing of the normal confines of a stream or otherbody of water, or the accumulation of water over areas that are notnormally submerged (some specific examples are discussed in Case Study9.2.6). Floods include river (fluvial) floods, flash floods, urban floods,pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and glacial lake outburstfloods” (see Glossary). The main causes of floods are intense and/orlong-lasting precipitation, snow/ice melt, a combination of these causes,dam break (e.g., glacial lakes), reduced conveyance due to ice jams orlandslides, or by a local intense storm (Smith and Ward, 1998). Floodsare affected by various characteristics of precipitation, such as intensity,duration, amount, timing, and phase (rain or snow). They are also affectedby drainage basin conditions such as water levels in the rivers, thepresence of snow and ice, soil character and status (frozen or not, soilmoisture content and vertical distribution), rate and timing of snow/icemelt, urbanization, and the existence of dikes, dams, and reservoirs (Bateset al., 2008). Along coastal areas, flooding may be associated with stormsurge events (Section 3.5.5). A change in the climate physically changesmany of the factors affecting floods (e.g., precipitation, snow cover, soilmoisture content, sea level, glacial lake conditions, vegetation) and thusmay consequently change the characteristics of floods. Engineering
developments such as dikes and reservoirs regulate flow, and land usemay also affect floods. Therefore the assessment of causes of changesin floods is complex and difficult. The focus in this section is on changes
in floods that might be related to changes in climate (i.e., referred to as‘climate-driven’), rather than changes in engineering developments or
land use. However, because of partial lack of documentation, these can
be difficult to distinguish in the instrumental record.
Literature on the impact of climate change on pluvial floods (e.g., flash
floods and urban floods) is scarce, although the changes in heavy
precipitation discussed in Section 3.3.2 may imply changes in pluvialfloods in some regions. This chapter focuses on the spatial, temporal,
and seasonal changes in high flows and peak discharge in rivers relatedto climate change, which cause changes in fluvial (river) floods. River
discharge simulation under a changing climate scenario requires a setof GCM or RCM outputs (e.g., precipitation and surface air temperature)
and a hydrological model. A hydrological model may consist of a landsurface model of a GCM or RCM and a river routing model. Differenthydrological models may yield quantitatively different river discharge,but they may not yield different signs of the trend if the same GCM/RCM outputs are used. So the ability of models to simulate floods, inparticular regarding the signs of the past and future trends, depends onthe ability of the GCM or RCM to simulate precipitation changes. Theability of a GCM or RCM to simulate temperature is important for riverdischarge simulation in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers. Downscalingand/or bias-correction are frequently applied to GCM/RCM outputsbefore hydrological simulations are conducted, which becomes a sourceof uncertainty. More details on the feasibility and uncertainties inhydrological projections are described later in this section. Coastalfloods are discussed in Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.5. Glacial lake outburstfloods are discussed in Section 3.5.6. The impact of floods on humansociety and ecosystems and related changes are discussed in Chapter 4.Case Study 9.2.6 discusses the management of floods. 
Worldwide instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited
in spatial coverage and in time, and only a limited number of gaugestations have data that span more than 50 years, and even fewer morethan 100 years (Rodier and Roche, 1984; see also Section 3.2.1). However,this can be overcome partly or substantially by using pre-instrumentalflood data from documentary records (archival reports, in Europecontinuous over the last 500 years) (Brázdil et al., 2005), and fromgeological indicators of paleofloods (sedimentary and biological recordsover centennial to millennial scales) (Kochel and Baker, 1982). Analysisof these pre-instrumental flood records suggest that (1) flood magnitudeand frequency can be sensitive to modest alterations in atmosphericcirculation, with greater sensitivity for ‘rare’ floods (e.g., 50-year flood andhigher) than for smaller and more frequent floods (e.g., 2-year floods)(Knox, 2000; Redmond et al., 2002); (2) high interannual and interdecadalvariability can be found in flood occurrences both in terms of frequencyand magnitude although in most cases, cyclic or clusters of floodoccurrence are observed in instrumental (Robson et al., 1998), historical(Vallve and Martin-Vide, 1998; Benito et al., 2003; Llasat et al., 2005),and paleoflood records (Ely et al., 1993; Benito et al., 2008); (3) pastflood records may contain analogs of unusual large floods, similar tosome recorded recently, sometimes considered to be the largest onrecord. For example, pre-instrumental flood data show that the 2002summer flood in the Elbe did not reach the highest flood levels recordedin 1118 and 1845 although it was higher than other disastrous floodsof 1432, 1805, etc. (Brázdil et al., 2006). However, the currently availablepre-instrumental flood data is also limited, particularly in spatial coverage.
The AR4 and the IPCC Technical Paper VI based on the AR4 concluded
that no gauge-based evidence had been found for a climate-drivenglobally widespread change in the magnitude/frequency of floods duringthe last decades (Rosenzweig et al., 2007; Bates et al., 2008). However,the AR4 also pointed to possible changes that may imply trends in floodoccurrence with climate change. For instance, Trenberth et al. (2007)highlighted a catastrophic flood that occurred along several central
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment176European rivers in 2002, although neither flood nor mean precipitation
trends could be identified in this region; however, there was a trendtoward increasing precipitation variability during the last century whichitself could imply an enhanced probability of flood occurrence.Kundzewicz et al. (2007) argued that climate change (i.e., observedincrease in precipitation intensity and other observed climate changes)might already have had an impact on floods. Regarding the spring peakflows, the AR4 concluded with high confidence that abundant evidence
was found for an earlier occurrence in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers(Rosenzweig et al., 2007; Bates et al., 2008), though we expressly notehere that a change in the timing of peak flows does not necessarilyimply nor preclude changes in flood magnitude or frequency in theaffected regions. 
Although changes in flood magnitude/frequency might be expected in
regions where temperature change affects precipitation type (i.e., rain/snow separation), snowmelt, or ice cover (in particular northern high-latitude and polar regions), widespread evidence of such climate-drivenchanges in floods is not available. For example, there is no evidence ofwidespread common trends in the magnitude of floods based on thedaily river discharge of 139 Russian gauge stations for the last few toseveral decades, though a significant shift in spring discharge to earlierdates has been found (Shiklomanov et al., 2007). Lindström andBergström (2004) noted that it is difficult to conclude that flood levelsare increasing from an analysis of runoff trends in Sweden for 1807 to2002.
In the United States and Canada during the 20th century and in the
early 21st century, there is no compelling evidence for climate-drivenchanges in the magnitude or frequency of floods (Lins and Slack, 1999;Douglas et al., 2000; McCabe and Wolock, 2002; Cunderlik and Ouarda,2009; Villarini et al., 2009). There are relatively abundant studies on thechanges and trends for rivers in Europe such as rivers in Germany andits neighboring regions (Mudelsee et al., 2003; Tu et al., 2005; Yiou etal., 2006; Petrow and Merz, 2009), in the Swiss Alps (Allamano et al.,2009), in France (Renard et al., 2008), in Spain (Benito et al., 2005), andin the United Kingdom (Robson et al., 1998; Hannaford and Marsh, 2008),but a continental-scale assessment of climate-driven changes in the
flood magnitude and frequency for Europe is difficult to providebecause geographically organized patterns are not seen in the reported
changes.
Available (limited) analyses for Asia suggest the following changes: the
annual flood maxima of the lower Yangtze region show an upward
trend over the last 40 years (Jiang et al., 2008), the likelihood forextreme floods in the Mekong River has increased during the second
half of the 20th century although the probability of an average flood
has decreased (Delgado et al., 2009), and both upward and downwardtrends are identified over the last four decades in four selected riverbasins of the northwestern Himalaya (Bhutiyani et al., 2008). In the
Amazon region in South America, the 2009 flood set record highs in the
106 years of data for the Rio Negro at the Manaus gauge site in July
2009 (Marengo et al., 2011). Recent increases have also been reportedin flood frequency in some other river basins in South America
(Camilloni and Barros, 2003; Barros et al., 2004). Conway et al. (2009)concluded that robust identification of hydrological change was severelylimited by data limitations and other issues for sub-Saharan Africa.Di Baldassarre et al. (2010) found no evidence that the magnitude ofAfrican floods has increased during the 20th century. However, suchanalyses cover only limited parts of the world. Evidence in the scientificliterature from the other parts of the world, and for other river basins,appears to be very limited.
Many river systems are not in their natural state anymore, making it
difficult to separate changes in the streamflow data that are caused bythe changes in climate from those caused by human regulation of theriver systems. River engineering and land use may have altered floodprobability. Many dams are designed to reduce flooding. Large damshave resulted in large-scale land use change and may have changed theeffective rainfall in some regions (Hossain et al., 2009).
The above analysis indicates that research subsequent to the AR4 still
does not show clear and widespread evidence of climate-drivenobserved changes in the magnitude or frequency of floods at the globallevel based on instrumental records, and there is thus low confidence
regarding the magnitude and frequency and even the sign of thesechanges. The main reason for this lack of confidence is due to limitedevidence in many regions, since available instrumental records of floodsat gauge stations are limited in space and time, which limits the numberof analyses. Moreover, the confounding effects of changes in land useand engineering mentioned above also make the identification ofclimate-driven trends difficult. There are limited regions with mediumevidence, where no ubiquitous change is apparent (low agreement).Pre-instrumental flood data can provide information for longer periods,but current availability of these data is even scarcer particularly in spa tial
coverage. There is abundant evidence for an earlier occurrence of springpeak flows in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers ( high confidence ), though
this feature may not necessarily be linked with changes in the magnitudeof spring peak flows in the concerned regions. 
The possible causes for changes in floods were discussed in the AR4 and
Bates et al. (2008), but cause-and-effect between external forcing andchanges in floods was not explicitly assessed. A rare example consideredin Rosenzweig et al. (2007) and Bates et al. (2008) was a study by Millyet al. (2002) which, based on monthly river discharge, reported animpact of anthropogenic climate change on changes (mostly increases)in ‘large’ floods during the 20th century in selected extratropical riverbasins larger than 20,000 km
2, but they did not endorse the study
because of the lack of widespread observed evidence of such trends inother studies. More recent literature has detected the influence ofanthropogenically induced climate change in variables that affectfloods, such as aspects of the hydrological cycle (see Section 3.2.2.2)including mean precipitation (X. Zhang et al., 2007), heavy precipitation(see Section 3.3.2), and snowpack (Barnett et al., 2008), though a directstatistical link between anthropogenic climate change and trends in themagnitude and frequency of floods is still not established. Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment177In climates where seasonal snow storage and melting play a significant
role in annual runoff, the hydrologic regime is affected by changes intemperature. In a warmer world, a smaller portion of precipitation fallsas snow (Hirabayashi et al., 2008a) and the melting of winter snowoccurs earlier in spring, resulting in a shift in peak river runoff to winterand early spring. This has been observed in the western United States(Regonda et al., 2005; Clow, 2010), in Canada (Zhang et al., 2001), andin other cold regions (Rosenzweig et al., 2007; Shiklomanov et al.,2007), along with an earlier breakup of river ice in Arctic rivers (Smith,2000; Beltaos and Prowse, 2009). The observed trends toward earliertiming of snowmelt-driven streamflows in the western United Statessince 1950 are detectably different from natural variability (Barnett etal., 2008; Hidalgo et al., 2009). Thus, observed warming over severaldecades that is attributable to anthropogenic forcing has likely been
linked to earlier spring peak flows in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers. Itis unclear if observed warming over several decades has affected themagnitude of the snowmelt peak flows, but warming may result eitherin an increase in spring peak flows where winter snow depth increases(Meehl et al., 2007b) or a decrease in spring peak flows because ofdecreased snow cover and amounts (Hirabayashi et al., 2008b; Dankersand Feyen, 2009). 
There is still a lack of studies identifying an influence of anthropogenic
climate change over the past several decades on rain-generated peakstreamflow trends because of availability and uncertainty in theobserved streamflow data and low signal-to-noise ratio. Evidence hasrecently emerged that anthropogenic climate change could haveincreased the risk of rainfall-dominated flood occurrence in some riverbasins in the United Kingdom in autumn 2000 (Pall et al., 2011). Overall,there is low confidence (due to limited evidence) that anthropogenic
climate change has affected the magnitude and frequency of floods,though it has detectably influenced several components of thehydrological cycle, such as precipitation and snowmelt, that may impactflood trends. The assessment of causes behind the changes in floods isinherently complex and difficult.
The number of studies that investigated projected flood changes in
rivers especially at a regional or a continental scale was limited when
the AR4 was published. Projections of flood changes at the catchment/river-basin scale were also not abundantly cited in the AR4. Nevertheless,Kundzewicz et al. (2007) and Bates et al. (2008) argued that more
frequent heavy precipitation events projected over most regions would
affect the risk of rain-generated floods (e.g., flash flooding and urban
flooding). 
The number of regional- or continental-scale studies of projected
changes in floods is still limited. Recently, a few studies for Europe(Lehner et al., 2006; Dankers and Feyen, 2008, 2009) and a study for theglobe (Hirabayashi et al., 2008b) have indicated changes in the frequency
and/or magnitude of floods in the 21st century at large scale using dailyriver discharge calculated from RCM or GCM outputs and hydrologicalmodels. A notable change is projected to occur in northeastern Europe
in the late 21st century because of a reduction in snow accumulation(Dankers and Feyen, 2008, 2009; Hirabayashi et al., 2008b), that is, a
decrease in the probability of floods, that generally corresponds tolower flood peaks. For other parts of the world, Hirabayashi et al.(2008b) show an increase in the risk of floods in most humid Asianmonsoon regions, tropical Africa, and tropical South America with adecrease in the risk of floods in non-negligible areas of the world suchas most parts of northern North America. 
Projections of flood changes at the catchment/river-basin scale are also
not abundant in the scientific literature. Several studies have beenundertaken for UK catchments (Cameron, 2006; Kay et al., 2009;Prudhomme and Davies, 2009) and catchments in continental Europeand North America (Graham et al., 2007; Thodsen, 2007; Leander et al.,2008; Raff et al., 2009; van Pelt et al., 2009). However, projections forcatchments in other regions such as Asia (Asokan and Dutta, 2008;Dairaku et al., 2008), the Middle East (Fujihara et al., 2008), SouthAmerica (Nakaegawa and Vergara, 2010; Kitoh et al., 2011), and Africa(Taye et al., 2011) are rare. 
Uncertainty is still large in the projected changes in the magnitude and
frequency of floods. It has been recently recognized that the choice ofGCMs is the largest source of uncertainties in hydrological projectionsat the catchment/river-basin scale, and that uncertainties from emissionscenarios and downscaling methods are also relevant but less important(Graham et al., 2007; Leander et al., 2008; Kay et al., 2009; Prudhommeand Davies, 2009), although, in general, hydrological projections requiredownscaling and/or bias-correction of GCM outputs (e.g., precipitationand temperature). Also the choice of hydrological models was found tobe relevant but less important (Kay et al., 2009; Taye et al., 2011).However, the relative importance of downscaling, bias-correction, andthe choice of hydrological models may depend on the selected region/catchment, the selected downscaling and bias-correction methods, andthe selected hydrological models (Wilby et al., 2008). For example, thesign of the above-mentioned flood changes in northeastern Europe isaffected by differences in temporal downscaling and bias-correctionmethods applied in the different studies (Dankers and Feyen, 2009).Chen et al. (2011) demonstrated considerable uncertainty caused byseveral downscaling methods in a hydrological projection for asnowmelt-dominated Canadian catchment. Downscaling (see Section3.2.3) and bias-correction are also a major source of uncertainty in rain-dominated catchments (van Pelt et al., 2009). We also note that bias-correction and statistical downscaling tend to ignore the energy closureof the climate system, which could be a non-negligible source ofuncertainty in hydrological projections (Milly and Dunne, 2011).
The number of projections of flood magnitude and frequency changes is
still limited at regional and continental scales. Projections at thecatchment/river-basin scale are also not abundant in the peer-reviewedscientific literature, especially for regions outside Europe and NorthAmerica. In addition, considerable uncertainty remains in the projections
of flood changes, especially regarding their magnitude and frequency.Therefore, our assessment is that there is low confidence (due to limited
evidence) in future changes in flood magnitude and frequency derived
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment178from river discharge simulations. Nevertheless, as was argued by
Kundzewicz et al. (2007) and Bates et al. (2008), physical reasoningsuggests that projected increases in heavy rainfall in some catchmentsor regions would contribute to increases in rain-generated local floods(medium confidence ). We note that heavy precipitation may be projected
to increase despite a projected decrease of total precipitation dependingon the regions considered (Section 3.3.2), and that changes in severalvariables (e.g., precipitation totals, frequency, and intensity, snow coverand snowmelt, soil moisture) are relevant for changes in floods.Confidence in change in one of these components alone may thus notbe sufficient to confidently project changes in flood occurrence. Hence,medium confidence is attached to the above statement based on
physical reasoning, although the link between increases in heavyrainfall and increases in local flooding seems apparent. The earlier shiftsof spring peak flows in snowmelt- and glacier-fed rivers are robustlyprojected (Kundzewicz et al., 2007; Bates et al., 2008); so these areassessed as very likely , though this may not necessarily be relevant for
flood occurrence. There is low confidence (due to limited evidence) in
the projected magnitude of the earlier peak flows in snowmelt- andglacier-fed rivers.
In summary, there is limited to medium evidence available to
assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude andfrequency of floods at a regional scale because the availableinstrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited inspace and time, and because of confounding effects of changesin land use and engineering. Furthermore, there is low agreement
in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global
scale regarding even the sign of these changes. There is low
confidence (due to limited evidence) that anthropogenic climate
change has affected the magnitude or frequency of floods,though it has detectably influenced several components of thehydrological cycle such as precipitation and snowmelt ( medium
confidence to high confidence ), which may impact flood trends.
Projected precipitation and temperature changes imply possiblechanges in floods, although overall there is low confidence in
projections of changes in fluvial floods. Confidence is lowdue to
limited evidence and because the causes of regional changes arecomplex, although there are exceptions to this statement. There ismedium confidence (based on physical reasoning) that projected
increases in heavy rainfall (Section 3.3.2) would contribute to
increases in rain-generated local flooding, in some catchments or
regions. Earlier spring peak flows in snowmelt- and glacier-fed
rivers are very likely , but there is low confidence in their projected
magnitude.
3.5.3. Extreme Sea Levels
Transient sea level extremes and extreme coastal high water are caused
by severe weather events or tectonic disturbances that cause tsunamis.
Since tsunamis are not climate-related, they are not addressed here. The
drop in atmospheric pressure and strong winds that accompany severeweather events such as tropical or extratropical cyclones (Sections 3.4.4
and 3.4.5) can produce storm surges at the coast, which may be furtherelevated by wave setup caused by an onshore flux of momentum due towave breaking in the surf zone. Various metrics are used to characterizeextreme sea levels including storm-related highest values, annualmaxima, or percentiles. Extreme sea levels may change in the future as
a result of both changes in atmospheric storminess and mean sea levelrise. However, neither contribution will be spatially uniform across the
globe. For severe storm events such as tropical and extratropicalcyclones, changes may occur in the frequency, intensity, or genesisregions of severe storms and such changes may vary between oceanbasins (see Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5). Along some coastlines, landsubsidence due to glacial isostatic adjustment (e.g., Lambeck et al.,2010) is causing a relative fall in sea levels. Variations in the rate of sealevel rise can be large relative to mean sea level (Yin et al., 2010) andwill occur as a result of variations in wind change (e.g., Timmermann etal., 2010), changes in atmospheric pressure and oceanic circulation(e.g., Tsimplis et al., 2008), and associated differences in water densityand rates of thermal expansion (e.g., Bindoff et al., 2007; Church et al.,2010; Yin et al., 2010). In addition, if rapid melting of ice sheets occursit would lead to non-uniform rates of sea level rise across the globe dueto adjustments in the Earth’s gravitational field (e.g., Mitrovica et al.,2010). On some coastlines, higher mean sea levels may alter theastronomical tidal range and the evolution of storm surges, andincrease the wave height in the surf zones. As well as gradual increasesin mean sea level that contribute to extreme impacts from transientextreme sea levels, rapid changes in sea level arising from, for example,collapse of ice shelves could be considered to be an extreme event withthe potential to contribute to extreme impacts in the future. However,knowledge about the likelihood of such changes occurring is limitedand so does not allow an assessment at this time.
Mean sea level has varied considerably over glacial time scales as the
extent of ice caps and glaciers have fluctuated with global temperatures.
Sea levels have risen around 120 to 130 m since the last glacial maximum19 to 23 ka before present to around 7,000 years ago, and reached alevel close to present at least 6,000 years ago (Lambeck et al., 2010). Aswell as the influence on sea level extremes caused by rapidly changingcoastal bathymetries (Clarke and Rendell, 2009) and large-scale circula tion
patterns (Wanner et al., 2008), there is some evidence that changes inthe behavior of severe tropical cyclones has changed on centennial timescales, which points to non-stationarity in extreme sea level events(Nott et al., 2009). Woodworth et al. (2011) use tide gauge records datingback to the 18th century, and salt marsh data, to show that sea levelrise has accelerated over this time frame.
The AR4 reported that there was high confidence that the rate of observed
sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century (Bindoff et al.,2007). It also reported that the global mean sea level rose at an averagerate of 1.7 (1.2 to 2.2) mm yr
-1over the 20th century, 1.8 (1.3 to 2.3)
mm yr-1over 1961 to 2003, and at a rate of 3.1 (2.4 to 3.8) mm yr-1
over 1993 to 2003. With updated satellite data to 2010, Church andWhite (2011) show that satellite-measured sea levels continue to rise atChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment179a rate close to that of the upper range of the AR4 projections. Whether
the faster rate of increase during the latter period reflects decadalvariability or an increase in the longer-term trend is not clear. However,there is evidence that the contribution to sea level due to mass lossfrom Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating (Velicogna, 2009; Rignotet al., 2011; Sørensen et al., 2011). The AR4 also reported that the risein mean sea level and variations in regional climate led to a likely
increase in the trend of extreme high water worldwide in the late 20thcentury (Bindoff et al., 2007), it was very likely that humans contributed
to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century (Hegerl et al.,2007), and therefore that it was more likely than not that humans
contributed to the trend in extreme high sea levels (IPCC, 2007a). Sincethe AR4, Menendez and Woodworth (2010), using data from 258 tidegauges across the globe, have confirmed the earlier conclusions ofWoodworth and Blackman (2004) that there was an increasing trend inextreme sea levels globally, more pronounced since the 1970s, and thatthis trend was consistent with trends in mean sea level (see also Loweet al., 2010). Additional studies at particular locations support this finding(e.g., Marcos et al., 2009; Haigh et al., 2010). 
Various studies also highlight the additional influence of climate
variability on extreme sea level trends. Menendez and Woodworth(2010) report that ENSO (see Section 3.4.2) has a large influence oninterannual variations in extreme sea levels in the Pacific Ocean andthe monsoon regions based on sea level records since the 1970s. Insouthern Europe, Marcos et al. (2009) report that changes in extremesare also significantly negatively correlated with the NAO (see Section3.4.3). Ullmann et al. (2007) concluded that maximum annual sea levelsin the Camargue had risen twice as fast as mean sea level during the20th century due to an increase in southerly winds associated with ageneral rise in sea level pressure over central Europe (Ullmann et al.,2008). Sea level trends from two tide gauges on the north coast ofBritish Columbia from 1939 to 2003 were twice that of mean sea levelrise, the additional contribution being due to the strong positive phaseof the PDO (see Section 3.4.3), which has lasted since the mid-1970s(Abeysirigunawardena and Walker, 2008). Cayan et al. (2008) reportedan increase of 20-fold at San Francisco since 1915 and 30-fold at La Jollasince 1933 in the frequency of exceedance of the 99.99th percentile sea
level. They also noted that positive sea level anomalies of 10 to 20 cm
that often persisted for several months during El Niño events producedan increase in storm surge peaks over this time. The spatial extent ofthese oscillations and their influence on extreme sea levels across the
Pacific has been discussed by Merrifield et al. (2007). Church et al.
(2006a) examined changes in extreme sea levels before and after 1950in two tide gauge records of approximately 100 years on the east and
west coasts of Australia, respectively. At both locations a stronger
positive trend was found in the sea level exceeded by 0.01% of theobservations than the median sea level, suggesting that in addition tomean sea level rise, other modes of variability or climate change are
contributing to the extremes. At Mar del Plata, Argentina, Fiore et al.(2009) noted an increase in the number and duration of positive stormsurges in the decade 1996 to 2005 compared to previous decades,which may be due to a combination of mean sea level rise and changesin wind climatology resulting from a southward shift in the South
Atlantic high.
Thus, studies since the AR4 conclude that trends in extreme sea level are
generally consistent with changes in mean sea level (e.g., Marcos et al.,2009; Haigh et al., 2010; Menendez and Woodworth, 2010) althoughsome studies note that the trends in extremes are larger than theobserved trend in mean sea levels (e.g., Church et al., 2006a; Ullmann etal., 2007; Abeysirigunawardena and Walker, 2008) and may be influencedby modes of climate variability, such as the PDO on the Canadian westcoast (e.g., Abeysirigunawardena and Walker, 2008). These studies areconsistent with the conclusions from the AR4 that increases in extremesare related to trends in mean sea level and modes of variability in theregional climate. 
The AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007b) projected sea level rise for 2090-2099
relative to 1980-1999 due to ocean thermal expansion, glaciers andice caps, and modeled ice sheet contributions of 18 to 59 cm, whichincorporates a 90% uncertainty range across all scenarios. An additionalcontribution to the sea level rise projections was taken into account fora possible rapid dynamic response of the Greenland and West Antarcticice sheets, which could result in an accelerating contribution to sea levelrise. This was estimated to be 10 to 20 cm of sea level rise by 2090-2099using a simple linear relationship with projected temperature. Becauseof insufficient understanding of the dynamic response of ice sheets,Meehl et al. (2007b) also noted that a larger contribution could not beruled out. 
Several studies since the AR4 have developed statistical models that
relate 20th-century (e.g., Rahmstorf, 2007; Horton et al., 2008) or longer(e.g.,Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Grinsted et al., 2010) temperatureand sea level rise to extrapolate future global mean sea level. Thesealternative approaches yield projections of sea level rise under a rangeof SRES scenarios by 2100 of 0.47 to 1.00 m (B1 to A2 scenarios; Hortonet al., 2008), 0.50 to 1.40 m (B1 to A1FI scenarios; Rahmstorf, 2007),0.75 to 1.90 m (B1 to A1FI scenarios; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009),and 0.90 to 1.30 m (A1B scenario only; Grinsted et al., 2010). However,future rates of sea level rise may be less closely associated with globalmean temperature if ice sheet dynamics play a larger role in the future(Cazenave and Llovel, 2010). Furthermore, Church et al. (2011) note thatthese models may overestimate future sea levels because non-climaterelated contributions to trends over the observational period such asgroundwater depletion may not have been removed, and non-lineareffects such as the reduction in glacier area as glaciers contract and thereduction in the efficiency of ocean heat uptake with global warming inthe future are not accounted for. Pfeffer et al. (2008), using a dynamicalmodel of glaciers, found that sea level rise of more than 2 m by 2100 isphysically implausible. An estimate of 0.8 m by 2100 that includedincreased ice dynamics was considered most plausible.
New studies, whose focus is on quantifying the effect of storminess
changes on storm surge, have been carried out over northern Europe
since the AR4. Debernard and Roed (2008) used hydrodynamic models
Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment180to investigate storm surge changes over Europe in four regionally
downscaled GCMs including two runs with B2, one with A2, and onewith an A1B emission scenario. Despite large inter-model differences,statistically significant changes between 1961-1990 and 2071-2100consisted of decreases in the 99th percentile surge heights south ofIceland, and an 8 to 10% increase along the coastlines of the easternNorth Sea and the northwest British Isles, which occurred mainly in thewinter season. Wang et al. (2008) projected a significant increase inwintertime storm surges around Ireland except the south Irish coastover 2031-2060 relative to 1961-1990 using a downscaled GCM underan A1B scenario. Sterl et al. (2009) joined the output from an ensembleof 17 GCM (CMIP3) simulations using the A1B emissions scenario overthe model periods 1950-2000 and 2050-2100 into a single longer timeseries to estimate 10,000-year return values of surge heights along theDutch coastline. No statistically significant change in this value wasprojected for the 21st century because projected wind speed changeswere not associated with the surge-generating northerlies but rathernon-surge generating south-westerlies. 
Other studies have undertaken a sensitivity approach to compare the
relative impact on extreme sea levels of severe weather changes andmean sea level rise. Over southeastern Australia, McInnes et al. (2009b)found that a 10% increase in wind speeds, consistent with the upperend of the range under an A1FI scenario from a multi-model ensemblefor 2070 together with an A1FI sea level rise scenario, would produceextreme sea levels that were 12 to 15% higher than those includingjust the A1FI sea level rise projection alone. Brown et al. (2010) alsoinvestigated the relative impact of sea level rise and wind speed changeon an extreme storm surge in the eastern Irish Sea. Both studiesconcluded that sea level rise rather than meteorological changes hasthe greater potential to increase extreme sea levels in these locations inthe future.
The degree to which climate models (GCM or RCM) have sufficient
resolution and/or internal physics to realistically capture the meteorologicalforcing responsible for storm surges is regionally dependent. For examplecurrent GCMs are unable to realistically represent tropical cyclones (seeSection 3.4.4). This has led to the use of alternative approaches forinvestigating the impact of climate change on storm surges in tropical
locations whereby large numbers of cyclones are generated usingstatistical models that govern the cyclones’ characteristics over theobserved period (e.g., McInnes et al., 2003). These models are thenperturbed to represent projected future cyclone characteristics and usedto force a hydrodynamic model. Recent studies on the tropical east
coast of Australia reported in Harper et al. (2009) that employ these
approaches show a relatively small impact of a 10% increase in tropicalcyclone intensity on the 1-in-100 year storm tide (the combined sea leveldue to the storm surge and tide), and mean sea level rise being foundto produce the larger contribution to changes in future 1-in-100 yearsea level extremes. However, one study that has incorporated scenarios
of sea level rise in the hydrodynamic modeling of hurricane-induced sea
level extremes on the Louisiana coast found that increased coastal
water depths had a large impact on surge propagation over land,increasing storm surge heights by two to three times the sea level rise
scenario, particularly in wetland-fronted areas (J.M. Smith et al., 2010).
To summarize, post-AR4 studies provide additional evidence that
trends in extreme coastal high water across the globe reflect theincreases in mean sea level, suggesting that mean sea level riserather than changes in storminess are largely contributing to thisincrease (although data are sparse in many regions and this lowersthe confidence in this assessment). It is therefore considered likely
that sea level rise has led to a change in extreme coastal highwater levels. It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic
influence on increasing extreme coastal high water levels via
mean sea level contributions. While changes in storminessmay contribute to changes in sea level extremes, the limitedgeographical coverage of studies to date and the uncertaintiesassociated with storminess changes overall (Sections 3.4.4 and3.4.5) mean that a general assessment of the effects of storminesschanges on storm surge is not possible at this time. On the basisof studies of observed trends in extreme coastal high waterlevels it is very likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to
upward trends in the future. 
3.5.4. Waves
Severe waves threaten the safety of coastal inhabitants and thoseinvolved in maritime activities and can damage and destroy coastaland marine infrastructure. Waves play a significant role in shaping acoastline by transporting energy from remote areas of the ocean to thecoast. Energy dissipation via wave breaking contributes to beach erosion,longshore currents, and elevated coastal sea levels through wave set-upand wave run-up. Wave properties that influence these processesinclude wave height, the wave energy directional spectrum, and period.Studies of past and future changes in wave climate to date have tendedto focus on wave height parameters such as ‘Significant Wave Height’(SWH, the average height from trough to crest of the highest one-thirdof waves) and metrics of extreme waves, such as high percentiles orwave heights above particular thresholds, although one study (Dodet etal., 2010) also examines trends in mean wave direction and peak waveperiod. It should also be noted that waves may become an increasinglyimportant factor along coastlines experiencing a decline in coastalprotection afforded by sea ice (see Sections 3.5.5 and 3.5.7).
Wave climates have changed over paleoclimatic time scales. Wave
modeling using paleobathymetries over the past 12,000 years indicatesan increase in peak annual SWH of around 40% due to the increase inmean sea level, which redefines the location of the coastline, and henceprogressively extends the fetch length in most of the shelf sea regions(Neill et al., 2009). Major circulation changes that result in changes instorminess and wind climate (see Section 3.3.3) have also affectedwave climates. Evidence of enhanced storminess determined from sanddrift and dune building along the western European coast indicates thatenhanced storminess occurred over the period of the Little Ice AgeChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment181(1570-1900) and the mid Holocene (~8,200 years before present; Clarke
and Rendell, 2009). 
The AR4 reported statistically significant positive trends in SWH over the
period 1950 to 2002 over most of the mid-latitudinal North Atlantic andNorth Pacific, as well as in the western subtropical South Atlantic, theeastern equatorial Indian Ocean and the East China and South ChinaSea, and declining trends around Australia, and parts of the Philippine,Coral, and Tasman Seas (Trenberth et al., 2007), based on voluntaryobserving ship data (e.g., Gulev and Grigorieva, 2004). Several studiesthat address trends in extreme wave conditions have been completedsince the AR4 and the new studies generally provide more evidence forthe previously reported positive trends in SWH and extreme waves inthe north Atlantic and north Pacific. Global trends in 99th-percentilesatellite-measured wave heights show a mostly significant positivetrend of between 0.5 and 1.0% per year in the mid-latitude oceans butless clear trends over the tropical oceans from 1985 to 2008 (Young etal., 2011). X.L. Wang et al. (2009b) found that SWH increased in theboreal winter over the past half century in the high latitudes of theNorthern Hemisphere (especially the northeast Atlantic), and decreasedin more southerly northern latitudes based on the European Centre forMedium Range Weather Forecasts 40-year reanalysis (ERA-40). Theyalso found that storminess around the 1880s was of similar magnitudeto that in the 1990s. This is also found using the same data set byLe Cozannet et al. (2011), who relate the change in waves to the NAOpattern that is moderated by an east Atlantic pattern of climate variabilityduring winter. A wave hindcast over the north-eastern Atlantic Oceanover the period 1953 to 2009 revealed a significant positive trend inSWH, as well as a counterclockwise shift in mean direction in the northand a slight but not significant increase in peak wave period in thenortheast. In the south, no trend was found for SWH or wave periodwhile a clockwise trend in mean direction was found (Dodet et al.,2010). In a regional North Sea hindcast, Weisse and Günther (2007)found a positive trend in 99th-percentile wave height from 1958 to theearly 1990s followed by a declining trend to 2002 over the southernNorth Sea, except on the UK North Sea coast where negative trendsoccurred over much of the hindcast period.
On the North American Atlantic coast, Komar and Allan (2008) found a
statistically significant trend of 0.059 m yr
-1in waves exceeding 3 m
during the summer months over 30 years since the mid-1970s at
Charleston, South Carolina, with weaker but statistically significant
trends at wave buoys further north. These trends were associated with
an increase in intensity and frequency of hurricanes over this period (see
Section 3.4.4). In contrast, winter waves, generated by extratropicalstorms, were not found to have experienced a statistically significantchange. In the eastern North Pacific, SWH is strongly correlated withEl Niño (Section 3.4.2). However positive trends were also found in SWH
and extreme wave height from the mid-1970s to 2006 in wave buoydata (Allan and Komar, 2006), for excesses of the 98th percentile SWH
over 1985 to 2007 (Menendez et al., 2008) along the US west coast, and
in hindcast SWH over 1948 to 1998 in the Southern Californian Bight
(Adams et al., 2008). Positive though not statistically significant trendsin annual mean SWH were found over south-eastern South America for
in situ wave data over the 1996-2006 period and in satellite wave data
over 1993 to 2001, while simulated wave fields using reanalysis windforcing over the period 1971 to 2005 produced statistically significanttrends in SWH (Dragani et al., 2010). Trends at particular locations maybe also influenced by local factors. For example, Suursaar and Kullas(2009) reported a slight decreasing trend in mean SWHs from 1966 to
2006 in the Gulf of Riga within the Baltic Sea, while the frequency andintensity of high wave events (i.e., the difference between the maximum
and 99th-percentile wave height) showed rising trends. These changeswere associated with a decrease in local average wind speed, but anintensification of westerly winds and storm events occurring further tothe west. 
In the Southern Ocean, SWH derived from satellite observations was
found to be strongly positively correlated with the SAM, particularly fromMarch to August (Hemer et al., 2010). However, the analysis of reliablelong-term trends in the Southern Hemisphere remains challenging dueto limited in situ data and problems of temporal homogeneity in
reanalysis products (Wang et al., 2006). For example, Hemer et al. (2010)also found that trends in SWH derived from satellite data over 1998-2000relative to 1993-1996 were positive only over the Southern Ocean southof 45°S whereas trends were positive across most of the SouthernHemisphere in the Corrected ERA-40 reanalysis (C-ERA-40; Hemer, 2010).Hemer (2010) found that the frequency of wave events exceeding the98th percentile over the period 1985 to 2002 using data from a wave buoysituated on the west coast of Tasmania showed no statistically significanttrend whereas a strong positive trend was found in equivalent fields ofC-ERA-40 data.
New studies have demonstrated strong links between wave climate and
natural modes of climate variability (Section 3.4.3). For example, alongthe US west coast and the western North Pacific, SWH was found to bestrongly correlated with El Niño (Allan and Komar, 2006; Sasaki andToshiyuki, 2007) and, in the Southern Ocean, SWH was positivitycorrelated with the SAM (Hemer et al., 2010). On the US east coast,positive trends in summer SWH were linked to increasing numbers ofhurricanes (Komar and Allan, 2008). In the northeast Atlantic, trends inSWH exhibited significant positive (negative) correlations with the NAOin the north (south) and more generally, trends in SWH, mean wavedirection, and peak wave period over the period 1953 to 2009 wererelated to the increase in the NAO index over this time (Dodet et al.,2010). One study (X.L. Wang et al., 2009a) reported a link betweenexternal forcing (i.e., anthropogenic forcing due to greenhouse gasesand aerosols, and natural forcing due to solar and volcanic forcing) andan increase in SWH in the boreal winter in the high latitudes of theNorthern Hemisphere (especially the northeast North Atlantic), and adecrease in more southerly northern latitudes over the past half century. 
The AR4 projected an increase in extreme wave height in many regions
of the mid-latitude oceans as a result of projected increases in wind speedsassociated with more intense mid-latitude storms in these regions in afuture warmer climate (Meehl et al., 2007b). At the regional scale,Chapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment182increases in wave height were projected for most mid-latitude areas
analyzed, including the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Ocean(Christensen et al., 2007) but with low confidence due to low confidence
in projected changes in mid-latitude storm tracks and intensities (see
Section 3.4.5). Several studies since then have developed wave climateprojections that provide stronger evidence for future wave climate
change. Global-scale projections of SWH were developed by Mori et al.(2010), using a 1.25° resolution wave model forced with projected windsfrom a 20-km global GCM, in which ensemble-averaged SST changesfrom the CMIP3 models provided the climate forcing. The spatial patternof projected SWH change between 1979-2004 and 2075-2100 reflectsthe changes in the forcing winds, which are generally similar to the meanwind speed changes shown in Figure 3-8. Extreme waves (measured bya spatial and temporal average of the top 10 values over the 25-yearperiod) were projected to exhibit large increases in the northern Pacific,particularly close to Japan due to an increase in strong tropical cyclonesand also the Indian Ocean despite decreases in SWH. 
A number of regional studies have also been completed since the AR4
in which forcing conditions were obtained for a few selected emissionscenarios (typically B2 and A2, representing low-high ranges) from GCMsor RCMs. These studies provide additional evidence for positive projectedtrends in SWH and extreme waves along the western European coast(e.g., Debernard and Roed, 2008; Grabemann and Weisse, 2008) and theUK coast (Leake et al., 2007), declines in extreme wave height in theMediterranean sea (Lionello et al., 2008) and the southeast coast ofAustralia (Hemer et al., 2010), and little change along the Portuguesecoast (Andrade et al., 2007). However, considerable variation in projec tions
can arise from the different climate models and scenarios used to forcewave models, which lowers the confidence in the projections. For example,along the European North Sea coast, 99th-percentile wave height overthe late 21st century relative to the late 20th century is projected toincrease by 6 to 8% by Debernard and Roed (2008) based on wavemodel simulations with forcing from several GCMs under A2, B2, andA1B greenhouse gas scenarios, whereas they are projected to increaseby up to 18% by Grabemann and Weisse (2008), who downscaled twoGCMs under A2 and B2 emission scenarios. In one region, oppositetrends in extreme waves were projected. Grabemann and Weisse (2008)
project negative trends in 99th-percentile wave height along the UK
North Sea coast, whereas Leake et al. (2007) downscaled the sameGCM for the same emission scenarios, using a different RCM, and found
positive changes in high percentile wave heights offshore of the East
Anglia coastline. A wave projection study by Hemer et al. (2010)concluded that uncertainties arising from the method by which climate
model winds were applied to wave model simulations (e.g., by applying
bias-correction to winds or perturbing current climate winds with wind
changes derived from climate models) made a larger contribution to the
spread of RCM projections than the forcing from different GCMs or
emission scenarios. 
In summary, although post-AR4 studies are few and their regional
coverage is limited, their findings generally support the evidence
from earlier studies of wave climate trends. Most studies find alink between variations in waves (both SWH and extremes) and
internal climate variability. There is low confidence that there
has been an anthropogenic influence on extreme wave heights(because of insufficient literature). Despite the existence ofdownscaling studies for some regions such as the eastern NorthSea, there is overall low confidence in wave height projections
because of the small number of studies, the lack of consistencyof the wind projections between models, and limitations in theirability to simulate extreme winds. However, the strong linkagesbetween wave height and winds and storminess means that it islikely that future negative or positive changes in SWH will reflect
future changes in these parameters. 
3.5.5. Coastal Impacts
Severe coastal hazards such as erosion and inundation are important inthe context of disaster risk management and may be affected by climatechange through rising sea levels and changes in extreme events.Increasing sea levels will also increase the potential for saltwater intrusioninto coastal aquifers. Coastal inundation occurs during periods of extremesea levels due to storm surges and high waves, particularly whencombined with high tides. Although tropical and extratropical cyclones(Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5) are the most common causes of sea levelextremes, other weather events that cause persistent winds such asanticyclones and fronts can also influence coastal sea levels (Green etal., 2009; McInnes et al., 2009b). In many parts of the world, sea levelsare influenced by modes of large scale variability such as ENSO (Section3.4.2). In the western equatorial Pacific, sea levels can fluctuate up to halfa meter between ENSO phases (Church et al., 2006b) and in combinationwith extremes of the tidal cycle, can cause extensive inundation in low-lying atoll nations even in the absence of extreme weather events(Lowe et al., 2010). 
Shoreline position can change from the combined effects of various
factors such as: 
1)Rising mean sea levels, which cause landward recession of coastlinesmade up of erodible materials (e.g., Ranasinghe and Stive, 2009)
2)Changes in coastal height due to isostatic rebound (Blewitt et al.,2010; Mitrovica et al., 2010), or sediment compaction from theremoval of oil, gas, and water (Syvitski et al., 2009)
3)Changes in the frequency or severity of transient storm erosionevents (K.Q. Zhang et al., 2004)
4)Changes in sediment supply to the coast (Stive et al., 2003;Nicholls et al., 2007; Tamura et al., 2010)
5)Changes in wave speed due to sea level rise, which alters waverefraction, or in wave direction, which can cause realignment ofshorelines (Ranasinghe et al., 2004; Bryan et al., 2008; Tamura etal., 2010)
6)The loss of natural protective structures such as coral reefs (e.g.,Sheppard et al., 2005; Gravelle and Mimura, 2008) due toincreased ocean temperatures (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) and oceanacidification (Bongaerts et al., 2010) or the reduction in permafrostChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment183or sea ice in mid- and high latitudes, which exposes soft shores to
the effects of waves and severe storms (see Section 3.5.7; Mansonand Solomon, 2007).
For example, permafrost degradation and sea ice retreat may contribute
to coastal erosion in Arctic regions (see Section 3.5.7).
The susceptibility of coastal regions to erosion and inundation is related
to various physical (e.g., shoreline slope), and geomorphological andecosystem attributes, and therefore may be inferred to some extentfrom broad coastal characterizations. These include the presence ofbeaches, rocky shorelines, or coasts with cliffs; deltas; back-barrierenvironments such as estuaries and lagoons; the presence of mangroves,salt marshes, or sea grasses; and shorelines flanked by coral reefs (e.g.,Nicholls et al., 2007) or by permafrost or seasonal sea ice, each of whichare characterized by different vulnerability to climate change-drivenhazards. For example, deltas are low-lying and hence generally prone toinundation, while beaches are comprised of loose particles and thereforeerodible. However, the degree to which these systems are impacted byerosion and inundation will also be influenced by other factors affectingdisaster responses. For example, reduced protection from high wavesduring severe storms could occur as a result of depleted mangroveforests or the degradation of coral reefs (e.g., Gravelle and Mimura,2008), or loss of sea ice or permafrost (e.g., Manson and Solomon, 2007);there may be a loss of ecosystem services brought about by saltwatercontamination of already limited freshwater reserves due to rising sealevels and these will amplify the risks brought about by climate change(McGranahan et al., 2007), and also reduce the resilience of coastalsettlements to disasters. Dynamical processes such as vertical landmovement also contribute to inundation potential (Haigh et al., 2009).Coastal regions may be rising or falling due to post-glacial rebound orslumping due to aquifer drawdown (Syvitski et al., 2009). Multiplecontributions to coastal flooding such as heavy rainfall and flooding incoastal catchments that coincide with elevated sea levels may also beimportant. Ecosystems such as coral reefs also play an important role inproviding material on which atolls are formed. Large-scale oceanicchanges that are particularly relevant to both coral reefs and smallisland countries are discussed in Box 3-4.
As discussed in Section 3.5.3, mean sea level has risen by 120 to 130 m
since the end of the last glacial maximum (Jansen et al., 2007), and this
has had a profound effect on coastline position around the world.Coastlines have also evolved over this time frame due to changes in the
action of the ocean on the coast through changes in wave climate
(Neill et al., 2009) and tides (Gehrels et al., 1995), which arise from thechanging geometries of coastlines over glacial time scales and changes
in storminess (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009).
The AR4 (Nicholls et al., 2007) reported that coasts are experiencing the
adverse consequences of impacts such as increased coastal inundation,
erosion, and ecosystem losses. However, attributing these changes to
sea level rise is difficult due to the multiple drivers of change over the
20th century (R.J. Nicholls, 2010) and the scarcity and fragmentarynature of data sets that contribute to the problem of identifying andattributing changes (e.g., Defeo et al., 2009). Since the AR4 there have
been several new studies that examine coastline changes. In theCaribbean, the beach profiles at 200 sites across 113 beaches and eightislands were monitored on a three-monthly basis from 1985 to 2000,with most beaches found to be eroding and faster rates of erosiongenerally found on islands that had been impacted by a higher numberof hurricanes (Cambers, 2009). However, the relative importance ofanthropogenic factors, climate variability, and climate change on theeroding trends could not be separated quantitatively. In Australia,Church et al. (2008) report that despite the positive trend in sea levelsduring the 20th century, beaches have generally been free of chronic
coastal erosion, and where it has been observed it has not been possible
to unambiguously attribute it to sea level rise in the presence of otheranthropogenic activities. Webb and Kench (2010) argue that thecommonly held view of atoll nations being vulnerable to erosion mustbe reconsidered in the context of physical adjustments to the entireisland shoreline, because erosion of some sectors may be balanced byprogradation on other sectors. In their survey of 27 atoll islands acrossthree central Pacific Nations (Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Federated States ofMicronesia) over a 19- to 61-year period using photography andsatellite imagery, they found that 43% of islands remained stable and43% increased in area, with largest rates of increase in island arearanging from 0.1 to 5.6 ha per decade. Only 14% of islands studiedexhibited a net reduction in area. On islands exhibiting either no netchange or an increase in area, a larger redistribution of land area wasevident in 65% of cases, consisting of mainly a shoreline recession onthe ocean side and an elongation of the island or progradation of theshoreline on the lagoon side. Human settlements were present on 7 ofthe 27 atolls surveyed and the majority of those exhibited net accretiondue in part to coastal protection works. For a coral reef island at thenorthern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, Dawson and Smithers(2010) report a 6% increase in area and 4% increase in volume between1967 and 2007 but with a net retreat on the east-southeast shorelineand advance on the western side. Chust et al. (2009) evaluated therelative contribution of local anthropogenic (non-climate change related)and sea level rise impacts on the coastal morphology and habitats inthe Basque coast, northern Spain, for the period 1954 to 2004. Theyfound that the impact from local anthropogenic influences was aboutan order of magnitude greater than that due to sea level rise over thisperiod. Increased rates of coastal erosion have also been observed since1935 in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence (Forbes et al., 2004).
The AR4 stated with very high confidence that the impact of climate
change on coasts is exacerbated by increased pressures on the physicalenvironment arising from human settlements in the coastal zone (Nichollset al., 2007). The small number of studies that have been completedsince the AR4 have been either unable to attribute coastline changes tospecific causes in a quantitative way or else find strong evidence fornon-climatic causes that are natural and/or anthropogenic. 
The AR4 reported with very high confidence that coasts will be exposed
to increasing impacts, including coastal erosion, over coming decadesdue to climate change and sea level rise, both of which will be

Box 3-4 | Small Island States
Small island states represent a distinct category of locations owing to their small size and highly maritime climates, which me ans that
their concerns and information needs in relation to future climate change differ in many ways from those of the larger continen tal
regions that are addressed in this chapter. Their small land area and often low elevation makes them particularly vulnerable to  rising sea
levels and impacts such as inundation, shoreline change, and saltwater intrusion into underground aquifers (Mimura, 1999). Thei r
maritime environments lead to an additional emphasis on oceanic information to understand the impacts of climate change (see Ca se
Study 9.2.9). Particular challenges exist for the assessment of past changes in climate given the sparse regional and temporal coverage
of terrestrial-based observation networks and the limited in situ ocean observing network, although observations have improved
somewhat in recent decades with the advent of satellite-based observations of meteorological and oceanic variables. However, th e short
length of these records hampers the investigation of long-term trends in the region. The resolution of GCMs is insufficient to represent
small islands and few studies have been undertaken to provide projections for small islands using RCMs (Campbell et al., 2011).  In
regions such as the Pacific Ocean, large-scale climate features such as the South Pacific Convergence Zone ENSO (Section 3.4.2)  have a
substantial influence on the pattern and timing of precipitation, yet these features and processes are often poorly represented  in GCMs
(Collins et al., 2010). The purpose of this box is to present available information on observed trends and climate change proje ctions that
are not covered in the other sections of this chapter as well as discuss key aspects of the climate system that are particularl y relevant for
small islands. The very likely contribution of mean sea level rise to increased extreme sea levels (see Section 3.5.3), coupled with the
likely increase in tropical cyclone maximum wind speed (see Section 3.4.4), is a specific issue for tropical small island states.
Although the underlying data sources are limited, some data for the Indian Ocean, South Pacific (Fiji), and Caribbean were avai lable in
the studies of Alexander et al. (2006) and Caesar et al. (2011). Problems of data availability and homogeneity for the Caribbea n are
discussed by T.S. Stephenson et al. (2008). Based on standard extremes indices, positive trends in warm days and warm nights an d
negative trends in cold days and cold nights2have occurred across the Indian Ocean and South Pacific region for the period 1971 to
2005 (Caesar et al., 2011) and the Caribbean for the period 1951 to 2003 (based on data from Alexander et al., 2006). Based on the
same data sources, trends in average total wet-day precipitation were positive and statistically significant over the Indian Oc ean region,
negative over the South Pacific region, and weakly negative over the Caribbean. Trends in heavy and very heavy precipitation we re
positive over the Indian Ocean, negative over the South Pacific region, and close to zero over the Caribbean. We have low confidence in
temperature trends over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific region due to the shorter record over which trends were assessed,whereas for the Caribbean, we have medium confidence in the temperature trends due to the longer records available for assessment.
Because of the spatial heterogeneity exhibited in precipitation trends in general, there is insufficient evidence to assess obs erved
rainfall trends. For the Caribbean, temperatures are projected to increase across the region by 1 to 4°C over 2071-2100 relativ e to
1961-1990 under the A2 and B2 scenarios and rainfall is mainly projected to decrease by 25 to 50% except in the north (Campbell  et al.,
2011). Based on this study and the evidence for projected temperature increases reported for other regions (see Table 3-3) we h ave
medium confidence in the projected temperature increases for the Caribbean. However, due to the range of processes that contribute to
rainfall change, some of which are poorly resolved by GCMs, there is insufficient evidence to assess projected rainfall changes  on these
small islands.
Given the low elevation of many small islands, sea level extremes are of particular relevance. Sea level extremes are strongly influenced
by tidal extremes (Chowdhury et al., 2007; Merrifield et al., 2007). When the tide behavior is mostly semi-diurnal (two high an d low tides
per day), there will be a clustering of high spring tides around the time of the equinoxes whereas when the tide behavior is di urnal (one
high and low tide per day), the clustering of high spring tides will occur around the time of the solstices. In addition, ENSO has a strong
influence such that sea levels and their extremes are positively (negatively) correlated with the SOI in the tropical Pacific w est (east) of
180° (Church et al., 2006b; Menendez et al., 2010). Tides and ENSO have contributed to the more frequent occurrence of sea leve l
extremes and associated flooding experienced at some Pacific Islands such as Tuvalu in recent years, and make the task of deter mining
the relative roles of these natural effects and mean sea level rise difficult (Lowe et al., 2010). Furthermore, the steep shelf  margins that
surround many islands and atolls in the Pacific support larger wave-induced contributions to sea level anomalies. Unfortunately , wave
observations (including wave direction) that would facilitate more comprehensive studies of tide, surge, and wave extremes in t he region
are sparse, including those that are co-located with tide gauges (Lowe et al., 2010).

Continued next page185exacerbated by increasing human-induced pressures (Nicholls et al.,
2007). However it was also noted that since coasts are dynamic systems,adaptation to climate change required understanding of processesoperating on decadal to century time scales, yet this understanding wasleast developed. 
Because of the diverse and complex nature of coastal impacts, assessments
of the future impacts of climate change have focused on a wide rangeof questions and employed a diverse range of methods, making directcomparison of studies difficult (R.J. Nicholls, 2010). Two types of studiesare examined here: the first are assessments, typically undertaken at thecountry or regional scale and which combine information on physicalchanges with the socioeconomic implications (e.g., Nicholls and de laVega-Leinert, 2008); the second type are studies oriented around improvedscientific understanding of the impacts of climate change. In terms of
coastal assessments, Aunan and Romstad (2008) reported that Norway’sgenerally steep and resistant coastlines contribute to a low physical
susceptibility to accelerated sea level rise. Nicholls and de la Vega-Leinert(2008) reported that large parts of the coasts in Great Britain (including
England, Wales, and Scotland) are already experiencing widespreadsediment starvation and erosion, loss/degradation of coastal ecosystems,and significant exposure to coastal flooding. Lagoons, river deltas, andestuaries are assessed as being particularly vulnerable in Poland (Pruszakand Zawadzka, 2008). In Estonia, Kont et al. (2008) reported increasedbeach erosion, which is believed to be the result of increased storminess
in the eastern Baltic Sea since 1954, combined with a decline in sea ice
cover during the winter. Sterr (2008) reported that for Germany there is
a high level of reliance on hard coastal protection against extreme sea
level hazards, which will increase ecological vulnerability over time. InFrance, the Atlantic coast Aquitaine region was considered more
resilient to rising sea levels over the coming century because of thesediment storage in the extensive dune systems whereas the sandycoast regions of the Languedoc Roussillon region on the Mediterraneancoast were considered more vulnerable because of narrow dunesystems that are also highly urbanized (Vinchon et al., 2009). A coastalvulnerability assessment for Australia (Department of Climate Change,2009) characterized future vulnerability in terms of coastal geomorphology,sediment type, and tide and wave characteristics, from which it concludedthat the tropical northern coastline would be most sensitive to changesin tropical cyclone behavior while health of the coral reefs may alsoinfluence the tropical eastern coastline. The mid-latitude southern andeastern coastlines were expected to be most sensitive to changes inmean sea level, wave climate, and changes in storminess. A comparativestudy of the impact of sea level rise on coastal inundation across 84developing countries showed that the greatest vulnerability to a 1 msea level rise in terms of inundation of land area was located in EastAsia and the Pacific, followed by South Asia, Latin America, and theCaribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and finally sub-SaharanAfrica (Dasgupta et al., 2009).
New models have been developed for the assessment of coastal
vulnerability at the global to national level (Hinkel and Klein, 2009). Atthe local to regional scale, new techniques and approaches have alsobeen developed to better quantify impacts from inundation due tofuture sea level rise. Bernier et al. (2007) evaluated spatial maps ofextreme sea level for different return periods on a seasonal basis thatwere used to estimate seasonal risk of inundation under future sea levelscenarios. McInnes et al. (2009a) developed spatial maps of storm tideChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment
Coral reefs are a feature of many small islands and healthy reef systems mitigate against erosion and inundation by not only pr oviding a
buffer zone for the shoreline during extreme surge and wave events but also providing a source of carbonate sand and gravel, wh ich are
delivered to the shores by storms and swell to maintain the atoll (Woodroffe, 2008; Webb and Kench, 2010). Anthropogenic oceani c
changes may indirectly contribute to extreme impacts for coral atolls by affecting the health of the surrounding reef system. S uch
changes include: (1) warming of the surface ocean, which slows or prevents growth in temperature-sensitive species and causes m ore
frequent coral bleaching events (e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; see also Chapter 4); (2) ocean acidification, caused by increases in
atmospheric CO2being absorbed into the oceans, which lowers coral growth rates (Bongaerts et al., 2010); and (3) reduction in oxygen
concentration in the ocean due to a combination of changes in temperature-driven gas solubility (Whitney et al., 2007), ocean v entilation
due to circulation changes, and biological cycling of organic material (Keeling et al., 2010). Quantifying these changes and un derstanding
their impact on coral reef health will be important to understanding the impact of anthropogenic climate change on atolls.
In summary, the small land area and often low elevation of small island states make them particularly vulnerable to rising
sea levels and impacts such as inundation, shoreline change, and saltwater intrusion into underground aquifers. Shortrecord lengths and the inadequate resolution of current climate models to represent small island states limit the assessmentof changes in extremes. There is insufficient evidence to assess observed trends and future projections in rainfall across thesmall island regions considered here. The reported increases in warm days and nights and decreases in cold days andnights are of medium confidence over the Caribbean and of low confidence over the Pacific and Indian Oceans. There is
medium confidence in the projected temperature increases across the Caribbean. The unique situation of small islands
states and their maritime environments leads to an additional emphasis on oceanic information to understand the impactsof climate change. The very likely contribution of mean sea level rise to increased coastal high water levels, coupled with
the likely increase in tropical cyclone maximum wind speed, is a specific issue for tropical small island states.186and using a simple inundation model with high-resolution Light Detection
and Ranging (LIDAR) data and a land subdivision database, identifiedthe impact of inundation on several coastal towns along the southeasternAustralian coastline under future sea level and wind speed scenarios.Probabilistic approaches have also been used to evaluate extreme sealevel exceedance under uncertain future sea level rise scenarios. Purviset al. (2008) constructed a probability distribution around the range offuture sea level rise estimates and used Monte Carlo sampling to applythe sea level change to a two-dimensional coastal inundation model.They showed that by evaluating the possible flood-related losses inthis framework they were able to represent spatially the higher lossesassociated with the low-frequency but high-impact inundation eventsinstead of considering only a single midrange scenario. Hunter (2010)combined sea level extremes evaluated from observations with projectionsof sea level rise to 2100 and showed, for example, that planning levelsin Sydney, Australia, would need to be increased substantially to copewith increased risk of flooding. Along the Portuguese coast, Andrade etal. (2007) found that projected future climate in the HadCM3 modelwould not affect wave height along this coastline but the projectedrotation in wave direction would increase the net littoral drift and theerosional response. Along a section of the southeast coast of the UnitedKingdom, the effect of sea level rise, surge, and wave climate change onthe inshore wave climate was evaluated and the frequency and heightof extreme waves was projected to increase in the north of the domain(Chini et al., 2010). On the basis of modeling the 25-year beach responsealong a stretch of the Portuguese coast to various climate changescenarios, Coelho et al. (2009) concluded that the projected stormierwave climate led to higher rates of beach erosion than mean sea levelrise. Modeling of the evolution of soft rock shores with rising sea levelshas revealed a relatively simple relationship between sea level rise andthe equilibrium cliff profile (Walkden and Dickson, 2008).
To summarize, recent observational studies that identify trends
and impacts at the coast are limited in regional coverage, whichmeans there is low confidence , due to insufficient evidence,
that anthropogenic climate change has been a major cause ofany observed changes. However, recent coastal assessments atthe national and regional scale and process-based studies have
provided further evidence of the vulnerability of low-lying
coastlines to rising sea levels and erosion, so that in the absence
of adaptation there is high confidence that locations currently
experiencing adverse impacts such as coastal erosion and
inundation will continue to do so in the future due to increasing
sea levels in the absence of changes in other contributing factors. 
3.5.6. Glacier, Geomorphological, and Geological Impacts
Mountains are prone to mass movements including landslides, avalanches,
debris flows, and flooding that can lead to disasters. Changes in thecryosphere affect such extremes, but also water supply and hydropowergeneration. Many of the world’s high mountain ranges are situated at
the margins of tectonic plates, increasing the possibility of potentiallyhazardous interactions between climatic and geological processes. The
principal drivers are glacier ice mass loss, mountain permafrostdegradation, and possible increases in the intensity of precipitation(Liggins et al., 2010; McGuire, 2010). The possible consequences arechanges in mass movement on short contemporary time scales, andmodulations of seismicity and volcanic activity on longer, century tomillennium time scales. 
The AR4 assessed that “the late 20th century glacier wastage likely has
been a response to post-1970 warming” (Lemke et al., 2007). However,the impacts of glacier retreat on the natural physical system in thecontext of changes in extreme events were not assessed in detail.Additionally, the AR4 did not assess geomorphological and geologicalimpacts that might result from anthropogenic climate change. The moststudied change in the high-mountain environment has been the retreatof glaciers (Paul et al., 2004; Kaser et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2007;Rosenzweig et al., 2007). Alpine glaciers around the world were atmaximum extent by the end of the Little Ice Age (~1850), and haveretreated since then (Leclercq et al., 2011), with an accelerated decayduring the past several decades (Zemp et al., 2007). Most glaciers haveretreated since the mid-19th century (Francou et al., 2000; Cullen et al.,2006; Thompson et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2007; Schiefer et al., 2007; Pauland Haeberli, 2008). Rates of retreat that exceed historical experience andinternal (natural) variability have become apparent since the beginning ofthe 21st century (Reichert et al., 2002; Haeberli and Hohmann, 2008).
Outburst floods from lakes dammed by glaciers or unstable moraines [or
‘glacial lake outburst floods’ (GLOFs)] are commonly a result of glacierretreat and formation of lakes behind unstable natural dams (Clarke,1982; Clague and Evans, 2000; Huggel et al., 2004; Dussaillant et al.,2010). In the past century, GLOFs have caused disasters in many high-mountain regions of the world (Rosenzweig et al., 2007), including theAndes (Reynolds et al., 1998; Carey, 2005; Hegglin and Huggel, 2008),the Caucasus and Central Asia (Narama et al., 2006; Aizen et al., 2007),the Himalayas (Vuichard and Zimmermann, 1987; Richardson andReynolds, 2000; Xin et al., 2008; Bajracharya and Mool, 2009; Osti andEgashira, 2009), North America (Clague and Evans, 2000; Kershaw et al.,2005), and the European Alps (Haeberli, 1983; Haeberli et al., 2001;Vincent et al., 2010). However, because GLOFs are relatively rare, it isunclear whether their frequency of occurrence is changing at either theregional or global scale. Clague and Evans (2000) argue that outburstfloods from moraine-dammed lakes in North America may have peakeddue to a reduction in the number of the lakes since the end of the LittleIce Age. In contrast, a small but not statistically significant increase ofGLOF events was observed in the Himalayas over the period 1940 to2000 (Richardson and Reynolds, 2000), but the event documentationmay not be complete. Over the past several decades, human mitigationmeasures at unstable glacier lakes in the Himalaya and European Alpsmay have prevented some potential GLOF events (Reynolds, 1998;Haeberli et al., 2001). 
Evidence of degradation of mountain permafrost and attendant slope
instability has emerged from recent studies in the European AlpsChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment187(Gruber and Haeberli, 2007; Huggel, 2009) and other mountain regions
(Niu et al., 2005; Geertsema et al., 2006; Allen et al., 2011). This evidenceincludes several recent rock falls, rock slides, and rock avalanches inareas where permafrost thaw in steep bedrock is occurring. Landslideswith volumes ranging up to a few million cubic meters have occurred inthe Mont Blanc region (Barla et al., 2000), in Italy (Sosio et al., 2008;Huggel, 2009; Fischer et al., 2011), in Switzerland, and in BritishColumbia (Evans and Clague, 1998; Geertsema et al., 2006). Very largerock and ice avalanches with volumes of 30 to over 100 million m
3
include the 2002 Kolka avalanche in the Caucasus (Haeberli et al., 2004;Kotlyakov et al., 2004; Huggel et al., 2005), the 2005 Mt. Steller rockavalanche in the Alaska Range (Huggel et al., 2008), the 2007 Mt. Steeleice and rock avalanche in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon (Lipovsky et al.,2008), and the 2010 Mt. Meager rock avalanche and debris flow in theCoast Mountains of British Columbia. 
Quantification of possible trends in the frequency of landslides and ice
avalanches in mountains is difficult due to incomplete documentationof past events, especially those that happened before regular satelliteobservations became available. Nevertheless, there has been an apparentincrease in large rock slides during the past two decades, and especiallyduring the first years of the 21st century in the European Alps (Ravaneland Deline, 2011), in the Southern Alps of New Zealand (Allen et al., 2011),and in northern British Columbia (Geertsema et al., 2006) in combinationwith temperature increases, glacier shrinkage, and permafrost degradation.
Research, however, has not yet provided any clear indication of a
change in the frequency of debris flows due to recent deglaciation.Debris flow activity at a local site in the Swiss Alps was higher duringthe 19th century than today (Stoffel et al., 2005). In the French Alps nosignificant change in debris flow frequency has been observed since the1950s in terrain above elevations of 2,200 m (Jomelli et al., 2004).Processes not, or not directly, driven by climate, such as sediment yield,can also be important for changes in the magnitude or frequency ofalpine debris flows (Lugon and Stoffel, 2010).
Debris flows from both glaciated and unglaciated volcanoes, termed
lahars, can be particularly large and hazardous. Lahars produced byvolcanic eruptions on the glacier-clad Nevado del Huila volcano in
Colombia in 2007 and 2008 were the largest rapid mass flows on Earthin recent years. Similarly, large mass flows occur on ice-covered active
volcanoes in Iceland (Björnsson, 2003), including Eyjafjallajökull in 2010.
Large rock and ice avalanches, with volumes up to 30 million m
3, have
happened frequently (on average about one every four years) on the
glaciated Alaskan volcano, Iliamna, and are thought to be related to
elevated volcanic heat flow and possibly meteorological conditions
(Huggel et al., 2007). Glacier decay on active volcanoes can lead to a
reduction of lahar hazards due to less potential meltwater available for
lahar generation, but it is difficult to make a general conclusion as local
conditions also play important roles. In 1998, intense rainfall mobilizedpyroclastic material on the flanks of Vesuvius and Campi Flegreivolcanoes, feeding approximately 150 debris flows that damaged nearby
communities and resulted in 160 fatalities (Bondi and Salvatori, 2003).In the same year, intense precipitation associated with Hurricane Mitch
triggered a small flank collapse at Casita volcano in Nicaragua. This slopefailure transformed into debris flows that destroyed two towns andclaimed 2,500 lives (Scott et al., 2005). Following the 1991 Pinatuboeruption in the Philippines, heavy rains associated with tropical stormsmoved large volumes of volcanic sediment. The sediment dammed rivers,causing massive flooding across the region that continued for severalyears after the eruption ended (Newhall and Punongbayan, 1996).
A variety of climate and weather events can have geomorphological
and geological impacts. Warming and degradation of mountainpermafrost affect slope stability through a reduction in the shearstrength of ice-filled rock discontinuities. For example, the 2003European summer heat wave (Section 3.3.1) caused rapid thaw andthickening of the active layer, triggering a large number of mainly smallrock falls (Gruber et al., 2004; Gruber and Haeberli, 2007). Permafrost thawin sediment such as in talus slopes may increase both the frequency andmagnitude of debris flows (Zimmermann et al., 1997; Rist and Phillips,2005). The frost table at the base of the active layer is a barrier togroundwater infiltration and can cause the overlying non-frozen sedimentto become saturated. Snow cover can also affect debris flow activity bysupplying additional water to the soil, increasing pore water pressureand initiating slope failure (Kim et al., 2004). Many of the largest debrisflows in the Alps in the past 20 years were triggered by intense rainfallin summer or fall when the snowline was elevated (Rickenmann andZimmermann, 1993; Chiarle et al., 2007). Warming may increase theflow speed of frozen bodies of sediment (Kääb et al., 2007; Delaloye etal., 2008; Roer et al., 2008). Rock slopes can fail after they have beensteepened by glacial erosion or unloaded (debuttressed) following glacierretreat (Augustinus, 1995). Although it may take centuries or evenlonger for a slope to fail following glacier retreat, recent landslidesdemonstrate that some slopes can respond to glacier down-wastingwithin a few decades or less (Oppikofer et al., 2008). Twentieth-centurywarming may have penetrated some decameters into thawing steep rockslopes in high mountains (Haeberli et al., 1997). Case studies indicate thatboth small and large slope failures can be triggered by exceptionallywarm periods of weeks to months prior to the events (Gruber et al.,2004; Huggel, 2009; Fischer et al., 2011).
The spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation, the intensity and
duration of rainfall, and antecedent rainfall are important factors intriggering shallow landslides (Iverson, 2000; Wieczorek et al., 2005;Sidle and Ochiai, 2006). In some regions antecedent rainfall is probablya more important factor than rainfall intensity (Kim et al., 1991; Glade,1998), whereas in other regions rainfall duration and intensity are thecritical factors (Jakob and Weatherly, 2003). Landslides in temperateand tropical mountains that have no seasonal snow cover are nottemperature-sensitive and may be more strongly influenced by humanactivities such as poor land use practices, deforestation, and overgrazing(Sidle and Ochiai, 2006).
Rock and ice avalanches on glaciated volcanoes can be triggered by
heat generated by volcanic activity. Their incidence may increase withChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment188rising air and rock temperatures (Gruber and Haeberli, 2007) or during
or following brief, anomalously warm events (Huggel et al., 2010) dueto meltwater infiltration and shear strength reduction. Debuttressingeffects due to glacier retreat can also destabilize or over-steepen slopes(Tuffen, 2010). Furthermore, on volcanoes, geothermal heat flow canenhance ice melting and thus create weak zones at the ice-bedrockinterface; and hydrothermal alteration of rocks can decrease the slopestability (Huggel, 2009). On unglaciated high volcanoes in the Caribbean,Central America, Europe, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Japan, anincrease in total rainfall or an increase in the frequency or magnitude ofsevere rainstorms (see Section 3.3.2) could cause more frequent debrisflows by mobilizing unconsolidated, volcanic regolith and by raising pore-water pressures, which could lead to deep-seated slope failure. Heavyrainfall events could also influence the behavior of active volcanoes. Forexample, Mastin (1994) attributes the violent venting of volcanic gasesat Mount St. Helens between 1989 and 1991 to slope instability oraccelerated growth of cooling fractures within the lava dome followingrainstorms, and Matthews et al. (2002) link episodes of intense tropicalrainfall with collapses of the Soufriere Hills lava dome on Montserrat inthe Caribbean. It is well established that ice mass wastage following theend of the last glaciations led to increased levels of seismicity associatedwith post-glacial rebound of the lithosphere (e.g., Muir-Wood, 2000;Stewart et al., 2000). There has been a large reduction in glacier coverin southern Alaska. Sauber and Molnia (2004) reported several hundredmeters vertical reduction. This ice reduction may be responsible for anincrease in seismicity in the region where earthquake faults are at thethreshold of failure (Sauber and Molnia, 2004; Doser et al., 2007). Anincrease in the frequency of small earthquakes in the Icy Bay area, alsoin southeast Alaska, is interpreted to be a crustal response to glacierwastage between 2002 and 2006 (Sauber and Ruppert, 2008). Large-scale ice mass loss in glaciated volcanic terrain reduces the load on thecrust and uppermost mantle, facilitating magma formation and itsascent into the crust (Jull and McKenzie, 1996) and allowing magma toreach the surface more easily (Sigmundsson et al., 2010). At the end ofthe last glaciation, this mechanism resulted in a more than 10-foldincrease in the frequency of volcanic eruptions in Iceland (Sinton et al.,2005). 
The AR4 projected that glaciers in mountains will lose additional mass
over this century because more ice will be lost due to summer melting
than is replenished by winter precipitation (Meehl et al., 2007b). Thetotal area of glaciers in the European Alps may decrease by 20 to morethan 50% by 2050 (Zemp et al., 2006; Huss et al., 2008). The projectedglacier retreat in the 21st century may form new potentially unstable
lakes. Probable sites of new lakes have been identified for some alpine
glaciers (Frey et al., 2010). Rock slope and moraine failures may trigger
damaging surge waves and outburst floods from these lakes. Thetemperature rise also will result in gradual degradation of mountainpermafrost (Haeberli and Burn, 2002; Harris et al., 2009). The zone of warm
permafrost (mean annual rock temperature approximately -2 to 0°C),which is more susceptible to slope failures than cold permafrost, may
rise in elevation a few hundred meters during the next 100 years(Noetzli and Gruber, 2009). This in turn may shift the zone of enhancedinstability and landslide initiation toward higher-elevation slopes that in
many regions are steeper, and therefore predisposed to failure. Theresponse of bedrock temperatures to surface warming through thermalconduction will be slow, but warming will eventually penetrate toconsiderable depths in steep rock slopes (Noetzli et al., 2007). Other heattransport processes such as advection, however, may induce warming ofbedrock at much faster rates (Gruber and Haeberli, 2007). The responseof firn and ice temperatures to an increase in air temperature is fasterand nonlinear (Haeberli and Funk, 1991; Suter et al., 2001; Vincent et al.,2007). Latent heat effects from refreezing meltwater can amplify theincrease in air temperature in firn and ice (Huggel, 2009; Hoelzle et al.,2010). At higher temperatures, more ice melts and the strength of theremaining ice is lower; as a result, the frequency and perhaps size of iceavalanches may increase (Huggel et al., 2004; Caplan-Auerbach andHuggel, 2007). Warm extremes can trigger large rock and ice avalanches(Huggel et al., 2010).
Current low levels of seismicity in Antarctica and Greenland may be a
consequence of ice-sheet loading, and isostatic rebound associatedwith accelerated deglaciation of these regions may result in an increasein earthquake activity, perhaps on time scales as short as 10 to 100years (Turpeinen et al., 2008; Hampel et al., 2010). Future ice mass losson glaciated volcanoes, notably in Iceland, Alaska, Kamchatka, theCascade Range in the northwest United States, and the Andes, couldlead to eruptions, either as a consequence of reduced load pressures onmagma chambers or through increased magma-water interaction.Reduced ice load arising from future thinning of Iceland’s VatnajökullIce Cap is projected to result in an additional 1.4 km
3of magma
produced in the underlying mantle every century (Pagli and Sigmundsson,2008). Ice unloading may also promote failure of shallow magmareservoirs with a potential consequence of a small perturbation of thenatural eruptive cycle (Sigmundsson et al., 2010). Initially, ice thinningof 100 m or more on volcanoes with glaciers more than 150-m thick,such as Sollipulli in Chile, may cause more explosive eruptions, withincreased tephra hazards (Tuffen, 2010). Additionally, the potential foredifice lateral collapse could be enhanced by loss of support previouslyprovided by ice (Tuffen, 2010) or to elevated pore-water pressuresarising from meltwater (Capra, 2006; Deeming et al., 2010). Ultimatelythe loss of ice cover on glaciated volcanoes may reduce opportunitiesfor explosions arising from magma-ice interaction. The incidence of ice-sourced lahars may also eventually fall, although exposure of newsurfaces of volcanic debris due to ice wastage may provide the rawmaterial for precipitation-related lahars. The likelihood of both volcanicand non-volcanic landslides may also increase due to greater availabilityof water, which could destabilize slopes. Many volcanoes provide aready source of unconsolidated debris that can be rapidly transformedinto potentially hazardous lahars by extreme precipitation events.Volcanoes in coastal, near-coastal, or island locations in the tropics areparticularly susceptible to torrential rainfall associated with tropicalcyclones, and the rainfall rate associated with tropical cyclones isprojected to increase though the number of tropical cyclones is projectedto decrease or stay essentially unchanged (see Section 3.4.4). The impactof future large explosive volcanic eruptions may also be exacerbated by anChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment189increase in extreme precipitation events (see Section 3.3.2) that provide
an effective means of transferring large volumes of unconsolidatedash and pyroclastic flow debris from the flanks of volcanoes intodownstream areas. 
Quantification of possible trends in the frequency of landslides
and ice avalanches in mountains is difficult due to incompletedocumentation of past events. There is high confidence that
changes in heat waves, glacial retreat, and/or permafrostdegradation will affect high mountain phenomena such as slopeinstabilities, mass movements, and glacial lake outburst floods,and medium confidence that temperature-related changes will
influence bedrock stability. There is also high confidence that
changes in heavy precipitation will affect landslides in someregions. There is medium confidence that high-mountain debris
flows will begin earlier in the year because of earlier snowmelt,and that continued mountain permafrost degradation and glacierretreat will further decrease the stability of rock slopes. There islow confidence regarding future locations and timing of large rock
avalanches, as these depend on local geological conditions andother non-climatic factors. There is low confidence in projections
of an anthropogenic effect on phenomena such as shallowlandslides in temperate and tropical regions, because these arestrongly influenced by human activities such as poor land usepractices, deforestation, and overgrazing. It is well establishedthat ice mass wastage following the end of the last glaciationsled to increased levels of seismicity, but there is low confidence
in the nature of recent and projected future seismic responses toanthropogenic climate change. 
3.5.7. High-latitude Changes Including Permafrost
Permafrost is widespread in Arctic, in subarctic, in ice-free areas ofAntarctica, and in high-mountain regions, and permafrost regions occupyapproximately 23 million km
2of land area in the Northern Hemisphere
(Zhang et al., 1999). Melting of massive ground ice and thawing ofice-rich permafrost can lead to subsidence of the ground surface and to
the formation of uneven topography known as thermokarst, having
implications for ecosystems, landscape stability, and infrastructure
performance (Walsh, 2005). See also Case Study 9.2.10 for discussion of
the impacts of cold events in high latitudes. The active layer (near-
surface layer that thaws and freezes seasonally over permafrost) plays
an important role in cold regions because most ecological, hydrological,
biogeochemical, and pedogenic (soil-forming) activity takes place withinit (Hinzman et al., 2005). 
Observations show that permafrost temperatures have increased since the
1980s (IPCC, 2007b). Temperatures in the colder permafrost of northernAlaska, the Canadian Arctic, and Russia have increased up to 3°C near thepermafrost table and up to 1 to 2°C at depths of 10 to 20 m (Osterkamp,
2007; Romanovsky et al., 2010; S.L. Smith et al., 2010) since the late1970s/early 1980s. Temperature increases have generally been less than1°C in the warmer permafrost of the discontinuous permafrost zone of
the polar regions (Osterkamp, 2007; Romanovsky et al., 2010; S.L. Smithet al., 2010), and also in the high-altitude permafrost of Mongolia andthe Tibetan Plateau (Zhao et al., 2010). When the other conditionsremain constant, active layer thickness is expected to increase inresponse to warming. Active layer thickness has increased by about20 cm in the Russian Arctic between the early 1960s and 2000 (T. Zhanget al., 2005) and by up to 1.0 m over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau sincethe early 1980s (Wu and Zhang, 2010), with no significant trend in theNorth American Arctic since the early 1990s (Shiklomanov et al., 2010).However, over extreme warm summers, active layer thickness mayincrease substantially (Smith et al., 2009), potentially triggering active-layer detachment failures on slopes (Lewkowicz and Harris, 2005).Extensive thermokarst development has been found in Alaska (Jorgensonet al., 2006; Osterkamp et al., 2009), Canada (Vallée and Payette, 2007),and central Yakutia (Gavriliev and Efremov, 2003). Increased rates ofretrogressive thaw slump activities have been reported on slopes overthe Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Niu et al., 2005) and adjacent to tundralakes over the Mackenzie Delta region of Canada (Lantz and Kokelj,2008). Substantial expansion and deepening of thermokarst lakes wasobserved near Yakutsk with subsidence rates of 17 to 24 cm yr
-1from
1992 to 2001 (Fedorov and Konstantinov, 2003). Satellite remote sensingdata show that thaw lake surface area has increased in continuouspermafrost regions and decreased in discontinuous permafrost regions(Smith et al., 2005). Coasts with ice-bearing permafrost that are exposedto the Arctic Ocean are very sensitive to permafrost degradation. SomeArctic coasts are retreating at a rapid rate of 2 to 3 m yr
–1and the rate
of erosion along Alaska’s northeastern coastline has doubled over thepast 50 years, related to declining sea ice extent, increasing sea surfacetemperature, rising sea level, thawing coastal permafrost, and possiblyincreases in storminess and waves (Jones et al., 2009; Karl et al., 2009)
Increases in air temperature are in part responsible for the observed
increase in permafrost temperature over the Arctic and subarctic, butchanges in snow cover also play a critical role (Osterkamp, 2005; Zhang,2005; T. Zhang et al., 2005; S.L. Smith et al., 2010). Trends toward earliersnowfall in autumn and thicker snow cover during winter have resultedin a stronger snow insulation effect, and as a result a much warmerpermafrost temperature than air temperature in the Arctic. On the otherhand, permafrost temperature may decrease even if air temperatureincreases, if there is also a decrease in the duration and thickness ofsnow cover (Taylor et al., 2006). The lengthening of the thaw season andincreases in summer air temperature have resulted in changes in activelayer thickness. Model simulations have projected thickening of theactive layer, a northward shift of the permafrost boundary, reductionsin permafrost area, and an increase in permafrost temperature in the21st century and beyond (Saito et al., 2007; Schaefer et al., 2011). Theprojected permafrost degradation may result in ancient carbon currentlyfrozen in permafrost being released into the atmosphere, providing apositive feedback to the climate system (Schaefer et al., 2011). Expansionof lakes in the continuous permafrost zone may be due to thawing ofice-rich permafrost and melting of massive ground ice, while decreasesin lake area in the discontinuous permafrost zone may be due to lakeChapter 3 Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment190bottom drainage (Smith et al., 2005). Overall, increased air temperature
over high latitudes is primarily responsible for the development ofthermokarst terrains and thaw lakes.
In summary, it is likely that there has been warming of per mafrost
in recent decades. There is high confidence that permafrost
temperatures will continue to increase, and that there will beincreases in active layer thickness and reductions in the area ofpermafrost in the Arctic and subarctic. 
3.5.8. Sand and Dust Storms
Sand and dust storms are widespread natural phenomena in many partsof the world. Heavy dust storms disrupt human activities. Dust aerosols inthe atmosphere can cause a suite of health impacts including respiratoryproblems (Small et al., 2001). The long-range transport of dust canaffect conditions at long distances from the dust sources, linking thebiogeochemical cycles of land, atmosphere, and ocean (Martin andGordon, 1988; Bergametti and Dulac, 1998; Kellogg and Griffin, 2006).For example, dust from the Saharan region and from Asia may reachNorth America and South America (McKendry et al., 2007). Some climatemodels have representations of dust aerosols (Textor et al., 2006).Climate variables that are most important to dust emission and transportsuch as soil moisture (see also Section 3.5.1), precipitation, wind, andvegetation cover are still subject to large uncertainties in climate modelsimulations. As a result, the sand and dust storm simulations have largeuncertainties as well.
The Sahara (especially the Bodélé Depression in Chad) and east Asia
have been recognized as the largest dust sources globally (Goudie,2009). Over the few decades before the 1990s, the frequency of dustevents increased in some regions such as the Sahel zone of Africa(Goudie and Middleton, 1992), and decreased in some other regionssuch as China (Zhang et al., 2003). There seems to be an increase in morerecent years in China (Shao and Dong, 2006). Despite the importance ofAfrican dust, studies on long-term change in Sahel dust are limited.However, dust transported far away from the source region may providesome evidence of long-term changes in the Sahel region. The African
dust transported to Barbados began to increase in the late 1960s andthrough the 1970s; transported dust reached a peak in the early 1980sbut remains high into the present (Prospero and Lamb, 2003; Prosperoet al., 2009). 
Surface soil dust concentration during a sand and dust storm is
controlled by a number of factors. The driving force for the productionof dust storms is the surface wind associated with cold frontal systems
sweeping across arid and semi-arid regions and lifting soil particles inthe atmosphere. Dust emissions are also controlled by the surfaceconditions in source regions such as the desert coverage distributions,snow cover, and soil moisture. For example, in the Sahel region, theelevated high level of dust emission prior to the 1990s was related tothe persistent drought during that time, and to long-term changes in theNAO (Ginoux et al., 2004; Chiapello et al., 2005; Engelstaedter et al.,2006), and perhaps to North Atlantic SST as well (Wong et al., 2008).Further evidence of the importance of climate on dust emission is thatdespite an increase of approximately 2 to 7% in desert areas in Chinaover the four decades since 1960, dust storm frequency decreased inthat period (Zhong, 1999). Studies on Asian soil dust production from1960 to 2003 suggest that climatic variations have played a major rolein the declining trends in dust emission and storm frequencies in China(Zhang et al., 2003; Zhou and Zhang, 2003; Zhao et al., 2004; Gong etal., 2006). Overall, changes in dust activity are affected by changes inthe climate, such as wind and moisture conditions in the dust sourceregions. Changes in large-scale circulation play an additional role in thelong-distance transport of dust. However, understanding of the physicalmechanisms of the long-term trends in dust activity is not complete; forexample, the relative importance of the various factors affecting dustfrequency as outlined above is uncertain. 
Future dust activity depends on two main factors: land use in the dust
source regions, and climate both in the dust source region and large-scale circulation that affects long distance dust transport. Studies onprojected future dust activity are very limited. It is difficult to projectfuture land use. Precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff have beenprojected to decrease in major dust source regions (Figure 10.12 in Meehlet al., 2007b). Thomas et al. (2005) suggest that dune fields in southernAfrica can become active again, and sand will become significantlyexposed and move, as a consequence of 21st-century warming. A studybased on simulations from two climate models also suggests increaseddesertification in arid and semi-arid China, especially in the second halfof the 21st century (X.M. Wang et al., 2009). However, confident projectedchanges in wind are lacking (see Section 3.3.3). 
In summary, there is low confidence in projecting future dust
storm changes, although an increase could be expected wherearidity increases. There is a lack of data and studies on pastchanges. There is also a lack of understanding of processes suchas the relative importance of different climate variables affectingdust storms, as well as a high uncertainty in simulating importantclimate variables such as soil moisture, precipitation, and windthat affect dust storms.

Medium conﬁdence: Smaller or less signiﬁcant 
trends in S.E. Europe and Italy due to change point in trends at the end of the 1970s / 
beginning of 1980s; sometimes linked with 
changes in sign of trends; strongest WD increase 
since 1976 (Bartholy and Pongracz, 2007;

overall tendency for decrease in CN in S.E. 
Europe and E. Mediterranean (Kiktev et al., 
2003; Klein Tank and Können, 2003; 
Alexander et al., 2006). High conﬁdence: Likely overall increase 
in HW in summer (JJA). Signiﬁcant 
increase in max HW duration since 1880 in Iberian Peninsula and west Central 
Europe in JJA (Della-Marta et al., 
2007a). Signiﬁcant increase in max HW 
duration in Tuscany (Italy) (Bartolini et al., 2008). Signiﬁcant increase in HW indices in Turkey and to a smaller extent 
in S.E. Europe and Turkey in JJA 
(Kuglitsch et al., 2010). Less signiﬁcant signal in HW indices in S.E. Europe due to presence of change point in trends 
(Bartholy and Pongracz, 2007; Hirschi et 
al., 2011). Low conﬁdence : Inconsistent trends within

1970s prolonged Sahel drought dominates 
(Shefﬁeld and Wood, 2008a; Dai, 2011). No 
apparent continent-w ide trends in change 
in rainfall over the 20th century, although 
there was a continent-wide drought in

anomalies) than during the humid 1950s 
(L'Hôte et al., 2002; Dai et al., 2004; 
Shefﬁeld and Wood, 2008a; Dai, 2011). Dry 
spell duration (CDD) overall increased from 
1961 to 2000 (New et al., 2006). Recent 
years characterized by a greater 
interannual variability than previous 40 
years, western Sahel remaining dry and the 
eastern Sahel returning to wetter 
conditions (Ali and Lebel, 2009).

High conﬁdence : WD very likely  to increase – 
largest increases in summer and Central/S. 
Europe and smallest in N. Europe (Scandinavia) 
(Goubanova and Li, 2007; Kjellström et al., 
2007; Kofﬁ and Kofﬁ, 2008; Fischer and Schär, 
2010; Fig. 3-3) and CD very likely  to decrease 
(Fig. 3-3). Likely increase in RV20AHD (Fig. 3-
5). 
Medium conﬁdence:  Changes in higher 
quantiles of Tmax ge nerally greater than 
changes in lower quantiles of Tmax in summer 
in Central Europe and Mediterranean 
(Diffenbaugh et al., 2007; Kjellström et al., 
2007; Fischer and Schär, 2009, 2010; OS11). High conﬁdence : CN very likely  to decrease 
– largest decreases in winter in E. Europe 
and Scandinavia (Goubanova and Li, 2007; 
Kjellström et al., 2007; Sillmann and 
Roeckner, 2008). WN very likely  to increase 
(T06; Fig. 3-4). High conﬁdence: Likely more frequent, 
longer, and/or more intense heat waves and 
warm spells but little change over 
Scandinavia (Beniston et al., 2007; Kofﬁ and 
Kofﬁ, 2008; Clark et al., 2010; OS11). Low conﬁdence to high conﬁdence , depending on 
region : Likely  overall increases in HPD, %DP10, and 
RV20HP and decreases in return periods of long (5-
day) and short (1-day) events; strong signals in N. 
Europe particularly in winter, but lower conﬁdence 
in changes in Central Europe and in particular the 
Mediterranean (T06; Beniston et al., 2007; Fowler et 
al., 2007a; Sillmann and Roeckner, 2008; Kendon et 
al., 2010; Figs. 3-6 and 3-7). 
Likely  increase in HPC in some regions (Boberg et 
al., 2009b; Kendon et al., 2010). 
Likely  greater changes in extremes than mean in 
many regions. Increase in HP intensity (and increase 
in HPC) despite decrease in summer mean in some 
regions – e.g., Central Europe (Beniston et al., 2007; 
Fowler et al., 2007a; Haugen and Iversen, 2008; 
May, 2008; Kyselý and Beranová, 2009). Medium conﬁdence: European area 
affected by stronger dryness 
(reduced SMA and CDD) with largest 
and most consistent changes in 
Mediterranean Europe (T06; Burke 
and Brown, 2008; May, 2008; 
SW08b; Sillmann and Roeckner, 
2008; Fig. 3-10). 
High conﬁdence: Very likely  increase in 
frequency of WD, but smaller than in Central 
and S. Europe (Fischer and Schär, 2010; Fig. 3-
3). Very likely  decrease in CD (Fig. 3-3). Likely 
increase in RV20AHD (Fig. 3-5). 
Medium conﬁdence:  Changes in lower 
quantiles of Tmax gene rally greater than for 
changes in higher quant iles of Tmax in fall, 
winter, and spring in Scandinavia and 
northeastern Europe (OS11). High conﬁdence : CN very likely  to decrease 
(Kjellström et al., 2007; Sillmann and 
Roeckner, 2008; Fig. 3-4); WN very likely  to 
increase (T06; Fig. 3-4). 
Medium conﬁdence:  Changes in lower 
quantiles of Tmin generally greater than 
changes in higher quantiles of Tmin in 
Scandinavia and northeastern Europe 
(Kjellström et al., 2007; OS11). High conﬁdence : Likely  more frequent, 
longer and/or more intense heat waves and 
warm spells, but summer increases smaller 
than in S. Europe and little change over 
Scandinavia (Beniston et al., 2007; Kofﬁ and 
Kofﬁ, 2008; Fischer and Schär, 2010; OS11). 
Medium conﬁdence : Some dependency of 
projections of changes in HW intensity on 
parameterization choice (Clark et al., 2010). High conﬁdence: Very likely  increases in HP 
(intensity and frequency) and %DP10 north of 45°N 
in winter (Frei et al., 2006; T06; Beniston et al., 
2007; Kendon et al., 2008; Fig. 3-6). Likely  increase 
in RV20HP (Fig. 3-7). Medium conﬁdence : No major 
changes in dryness (CDD, SMA) in N. 
Europe (T06; SW08b; Sillmann and 
Roeckner, 2008; Fig. 3-10). 
High conﬁdence: Very likely increase in 
frequency and intensity of WD (Fischer and 
Schär, 2010; Fig. 3-3) and decrease in 
frequency of CD (Fig. 3-3). Very likely  increase 
in RV20AHD (Fig. 3-5). 
Medium conﬁdence:  Changes in higher 
quantiles of Tmax much larger than changes in 
lower quantiles of Tmax in summer; results in 
very large increase in Tmax variability 
(Diffenbaugh et al., 2007; Kjellström et al., 
2007; Fischer and Schär, 2009, 2010; OS11). High conﬁdence : CN very likely  to decrease 
(Goubanova and Li, 2007; Kjellström et al., 
2007; Sillmann and Roeckner, 2008); WN 
very likely  to increase (T06; Fig. 3-4). High conﬁdence : Likely more frequent, 
longer, and/or more intense heat waves and 
warm spells (Beniston et al., 2007; Kofﬁ and 
Kofﬁ, 2008; Clark et al., 2010; Fischer and 
Schär, 2010; OS11). 
Medium conﬁdence : Some dependency of 
projections of changes in HW intensity on 
parameterization choice (Clark et al., 2010). High conﬁdence: Likely increases in HP (intensity 
and frequency) in large part of the region in winter 
(Frei et al., 2006; Beniston et al., 2007; Kendon et 
al., 2008; Kyselý and Beranová, 2009; Fig. 3-6). 
Likely  increase in RV20HP (Fig. 3-7). 
Medium conﬁdence: Inconsistent evidence for 
summer: increase in HP in summer evident in RCMs 
(Christensen and Christensen, 2003; Frei et al., 
2006) versus no signal in GCMs (Fig. 3-6). Medium conﬁdence:  Increase in 
dryness (CDD, SMA) in Central 
Europe (Seneviratne et al., 2006a; 
T06; Fig. 3-10). 
Medium conﬁdence: Increase in 
short-term droughts (SW08b). G R G R G R G R G R

Extreme impacts can result from extreme weather and climate events, but can also occur without extreme
events. This chapter examines two broad categories of impacts on human and ecological systems, both of which are
influenced by changes in climate, vulnerability, and exposure: first, the chapter primarily focuses on impacts thatresult from extreme weather and climate events, and second, it also considers extreme impacts that are triggered byless-than-extreme weather or climate events. These two categories of impacts are examined across sectors, systems,and regions. Extreme events can have positive as well as negative impacts on ecosystems and human activities. 
Economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters have increased, but with large spatial and
interannual variability ( high confidence , based on high agreement, medium evidence ). Global weather- and
climate-related disaster losses reported over the last few decades reflect mainly monetized direct damages to assets,and are unequally distributed. Estimates of annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few US$ billion to above200 billion (in 2010 dollars), with the highest value for 2005 (the year of Hurricane Katrina). In the period 2000 to2008, Asia experienced the highest number of weather- and climate-related disasters. The Americas suffered the mosteconomic loss, accounting for the highest proportion (54.6%) of total loss, followed by Asia (27.5%) and Europe(15.9%). Africa accounted for only 0.6% of global economic losses. Loss estimates are lower bound estimates becausemany impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, are difficult to value and monetize,and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses. Impacts on the informal or undocumented economy, as wellas indirect effects, can be very important in some areas and sectors, but are generally not counted in reported esti-mates of losses. [4.5.1, 4.5.3.3, 4.5.4.1]
Economic, including insured, disaster losses associated with weather, climate, and geophysical events are
higher in developed countries. Fatality rates and economic losses expressed as a proportion of grossdomestic product (GDP) are higher in developing countries ( high confidence) . During the period from 1970 to
2008, over 95% of deaths from natural disasters occurred in developing countries. Middle-income countries withrapidly expanding asset bases have borne the largest burden. During the period from 2001 to 2006, losses amountedto about 1% of GDP for middle-income countries, while this ratio has been about 0.3% of GDP for low-income coun-tries and less than 0.1% of GDP for high-income countries, based on limited evidence . In small exposed countries, par-
ticularly small island developing states, losses expressed as a percentage of GDP have been particularly high, exceed-
ing 1% in many cases and 8% in the most extreme cases, averaged over both disaster and non-disaster years for theperiod from 1970 to 2010. [4.5.2, 4.5.4.1]
Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in
economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters ( high confidence ). Long-term trends in
economic disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate
change, but a role for climate change has not been excluded ( high agreement, medium evidence ). These
conclusions are subject to a number of limitations in studies to date. Vulnerability is a key factor in disaster losses, yet
not well accounted. Other limitations are: (i) data availability, as most data are available for standard economic sec-
tors in developed countries; and (ii) type of hazards studied, as most studies focus on cyclones, where confidence in
observed trends and attribution of changes to human influence is low. The second conclusion is subject to additional
limitations: the processes used to adjust loss data over time, and record length. [4.5.3.3]
Settlement patterns, urbanization, and changes in socioeconomic conditions have all influenced observed
trends in exposure and vulnerability to climate extremes ( high confidence ). Settlements concentrate the
exposure of humans, their assets, and their activities. The most vulnerable populations include urban poor in informal
settlements, refugees, internally displaced people, and those living in marginal areas. Population growth is also a driv-
er of changing exposure and vulnerability. [4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.5.1]
In much of the developed world, societies are aging and hence can be more vulnerable to climate
extremes, such as heat waves. For example, Europe currently has an aging population, with a higher populationExecutive Summary235Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems
density and lower birth rate than any other continent. Nonetheless, exposure to climate extremes in Europe has
increased whereas vulnerability has decreased as a result of implementation of policy, regulations, risk prevention, andrisk management. Urban heat islands pose an additional risk to urban inhabitants, most affecting the elderly, ill, andsocially isolated. [4.3.5.1, 4.3.6, 4.4.5]
Transportation, infrastructure, water, and tourism are sectors sensitive to climate extremes. Transport
infrastructure is vulnerable to extremes in temperature, precipitation/river floods, and storm surges, which can lead todamage in road, rail, airports, and ports, and electricity transmission infrastructure is also vulnerable to extreme stormevents. The tourism sector is sensitive to climate, given that climate is the principal driver of global seasonality intourism demand. [4.3.5.2, 4.3.5.3]
Agriculture is also an economic sector exposed and vulnerable to climate extremes. The economies of many
developing countries rely heavily on agriculture, dominated by small-scale and subsistence farming, and livelihoods inthis sector are especially exposed to climate extremes. Droughts in Africa, especially since the end of the 1960s, haveimpacted agriculture, with substantial famine resulting. [4.3.4, 4.4.2]
Coastal settlements in both developed and developing countries are exposed and vulnerable to climate
extremes. For example, the major factor increasing the vulnerability and exposure of North America to hurricanes is
the growth in population and increase in property values, particularly along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the UnitedStates. Small island states are particularly vulnerable to climate extremes, especially where urban centers and/or islandinfrastructure predominate in coastal locations. Asia’s mega-deltas are also exposed to extreme events such as flood-ing and have vulnerable populations in expanding urban areas. Mountain settlements are also exposed and vulnerableto climate extremes. [4.3.5.1, 4.4.3, 4.4.6, 4.4.9, 4.4.10]
In many regions, the main drivers of future increases in economic losses due to some climate extremes will
be socioeconomic in nature ( medium confidence , based on medium agreement , limited evidence ).The
frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events are only one factor that affects risks, but few studieshave specifically quantified the effects of changes in population, exposure of people and assets, and vulnerability asdeterminants of loss. However, these studies generally underline the important role of projected changes (increases) inpopulation and capital at risk. Additionally, some researchers argue that poorer developing countries and smallereconomies are more likely to suffer more from future disasters than developed countries, especially in relation toextreme impacts. [4.5.2, 4.5.4.2]
Increases in exposure will result in higher direct economic losses from tropical cyclones. Losses will
depend on future changes in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity ( high confidence ). Overall losses due to
extratropical cyclones will also increase, with possible decreases or no change in some areas ( medium confidence ).
Although future flood losses in many locations will increase in the absence of additional protection measures ( high
agreement, medium evidence ), the size of the estimated change is highly variable, depending on location, climate
scenarios used, and methods used to assess impacts on river flow and flood occurrence. [4.5.4.2]
Extreme events will have greater impacts on sectors with closer links to climate, such as water, agriculture
and food security, forestry, health, and tourism. For example, while it is not currently possible to reliably project
specific changes at the catchment scale, there is high confidence that changes in climate have the potential to serious-
ly affect water management systems. However, climate change is in many instances only one of the drivers of future
changes in supply reliability, and is not necessarily the most important driver at the local scale. The impacts of changes
in flood characteristics are also highly dependent on how climate changes in the future, and as noted in Section 3.5.2,
there is low confidence in projected changes in flood magnitude or frequency. However, based on the available
literature, there is high confidence that, in some places, climate change has the potential to substantially affect flood
losses. Climate-related extremes are also expected to produce large impacts on infrastructure, although detailed236Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems
analysis of potential and projected damages are limited to a few countries, infrastructure types, and sectors.
[4.3.2, 4.3.5.2]
Estimates of adaptation costs to climate change exhibit a large range and relate to different assessment
periods. For 2030, the estimated global cost ranges from US$ 48 to 171 billion per year (in 2005 US$) with recent
estimates for developing countries broadly amounting to the average of this range with annual costs of up to US$ 100billion. Confidence in individual estimates is lowbecause the estimates are derived from only three relatively
independent studies. These studies have not explicitly separated costs of adapting to changes in climate extremesfrom other climate change impacts, do not include costs incurred by all sectors, and are based on extrapolations ofbottom-up assessments and on top-down analysis lacking site-specificity. [4.5.3, 4.5.5, 4.5.6]2374.1. Introduction 
Chapter 3 evaluates observed and projected changes in the frequency,
intensity, spatial extent, and duration of extreme weather and climateevents. This physical basis provides a picture of climate change andextreme events. But it does not by itself indicate the impacts experienced
by humans or ecosystems. For example, for some sectors and groups of
people, severe impacts may result from relatively minor weather andclimate events. To understand impacts triggered by weather and climateevents, the exposure and vulnerability of humans and ecological systemsneed to be examined. The emphasis of this chapter is on negativeimpacts, in line with this report’s focus on managing the risks of extreme
events and disasters. Weather and c limate events, however, can and often
do have positive impacts for some people and ecosystems. 
In this chapter, two different types of impacts on human and ecological
systems are examined: (i) impacts of extreme weather and climateevents; and (ii) extreme impacts triggered by less-than-extreme weatheror climate events (in combination with non-climatic factors, such ashigh exposure and/or vulnerability). Where data are available, impactsare examined from sectoral and regional perspectives. Throughout thischapter, the term ‘climate extremes’ will be used to refer in brief to‘extreme weather and extreme climate events,’ as defined in theGlossary and discussed more extensively in Section 3.1.2. 
Activities undertaken as disaster risk reduction may also act as adaptation
to trends in climate extremes resulting from climate change, and theymay thereby act to reduce impacts. Strategies to reduce risk from onetype of climate extreme may act to increase or decrease the risk fromanother. In writing this chapter, we have not considered these issues assubsequent chapters are dedicated to adaptation. Here, impacts areassessed without discussion of the specific possible adaptation or disasterrisk reduction strategies or policies evaluated in subsequent chapters. 
Examination of trends in impacts and disasters highlights the difficulties
in attributing trends in weather- and climate-related disasters to climatechange. Trends in exposure and vulnerability and their relationship withclimate extremes are discussed. The chapter then examines system- and
sector-based aspects of vulnerability, exposure, and impacts, bothobserved and projected. The same issues are examined regionally before
the chapter concludes with a section on the costs of weather- and
climate-related impacts, disasters, and adaptation. 
4.2. Climatic Extremes in Natural
and Socioeconomic Systems
4.2.1. How Do Climate Extremes Impact
on Humans and Ecosystems?
The impacts of weather and climate extremes are largely determined by
exposure and vulnerability. This is occurring in a context where all three
components – exposure, vulnerability, and climate – are highly dynamicand subject to continuous change. Some changes in exposure and
vulnerability can be considered as adaptive actions. F or example, migration
away from high-hazard areas (see Chapter 1 and the Glossary for adefinition of the term ‘hazard’) reduces exposure and the chance ofdisaster and is also an adaptation to increasing risk from climateextremes (Adger et al., 2001; Dodman and Satterthwaite, 2008; Revi,2008). Similar adaptive actions are reflected in changes in buildingregulations and livelihoods, among many other examples. 
Extreme impacts on humans and ecosystems can be conceptualized as
‘disasters’ or ‘emergencies.’ Many contemporary definitions emphasizeeither that a disaster results when the impact is such that local capacityto cope is exceeded or such that it severely disrupts normal activities.There is a significant literature on the definitional issues, which includefactors of scale and irreversibility (Quarantelli, 1998; Handmer andDovers, 2007). Disasters result from impacts that require both exposureto the climate event and a susceptibility to harm by what is exposed.Impacts can include major destruction of assets and disruption toeconomic sectors, loss of human lives, mental health effects, or loss andimpacts on plants, animals, and ecosystem services. The Glossary pro vides
the definition of disaster used in this chapter.
Exposure can be conceptualized as the presence of human and ecosystem
tangible and intangible assets and activities (including services) in areasaffected by climate extremes (see Sections 1.1.2 and 2.2 and theGlossary for definitional discussion). Without exposure there is noimpact. Temporal and spatial scales are also important. Exposure can bemore or less permanent; for example, exposure can be increased bypeople visiting an area or decreased by evacuation of people andlivestock after a warning. As human activity and settlements expandinto an exposed area, more people will be subject to and affected bylocal climatic hazards. Population growth is predominantly in developingcountries (Peduzzi et al., 2011; UNISDR, 2011). Newly occupied areasaround or in urban areas were previously left vacant because they areprone to the occurrence of climatic hazards (Handmer and Dovers,2007; Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Wilbanks et al., 2007), for example with
movement of squatters to and development of informal settlements inareas prone to flooding (Huq et al., 2007) and landslides (Anderson etal., 2007). ‘Informal settlements’ are characterized by an absence ofinvolvement by government in planning, building, or infrastructure andlack of secure tenure. In addition, there are affluent individuals pursuingenvironmental amenity through coastal canal estates, riverside, andbush locations, which are often at greater risk from floods and fires(Handmer and Dovers, 2007). 
Exposure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for impacts. For
exposed areas to be subjected to significant impacts from a weather orclimate event there must be vulnerability. Vulnerability is composed of(i) susceptibility of what is exposed to harm (loss or damage) from theevent, and (ii) its capacity to recover (Cutter and Emrich, 2006; seeSections 1.1.2 and 2.2 and the Glossary). Vulnerability is defined here asin the Glossary as the propensity or predisposition to be adverselyaffected. For example, those whose livelihoods are weather-dependentChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems238or whose housing offers limited protection from weather events will be
particularly susceptible to harm (Dodman and Satterthwaite, 2008).Others with limited capacity to recover include those with limitedpersonal resources for recovery or with no access to external resourcessuch as insurance or aid after an event, and those with limited personalsupport networks (Handmer and Dovers, 2007). Knowledge, health, andaccess to services of all kinds including emergency services and politicalsupport help reduce both key aspects of vulnerability. 
The concept of ‘resilience’ (developed in an ecological context by Holling,
1978; in a broad social sustainability context by Handmer and Dovers,2007; and by Adger, 2000; Folke et al., 2002; see also the Glossary)emphasizes the positive components of resistance or adaptability in theface of an event and ability to cope and recover. This concept of‘resilience’ is often seen as a positive way of expressing a similarconcept to that contained in the term ‘vulnerability’ (Handmer, 2003).
Refugees, internally displaced people, and those driven into marginal
areas as a result of violence can be dramatic examples of peoplevulnerable to the negative effects of weather and climate events, cut offfrom coping mechanisms and support networks (Handmer and Dovers,2007). Reasons for the increase in vulnerability associated with warfareinclude destruction or abandonment of infrastructure (e.g., transport,
communications, health, and education) and shelter, redirection ofresources from social to military purposes, collapse of trade andcommerce, abandonment of subsistence farmlands, lawlessness, anddisruption of social networks (Levy and Sidel, 2000; Collier et al., 2003).The proliferation of weapons and minefields, the absence of basichealth and education, and collapse of livelihoods can ensure that theeffects of war on vulnerability to disasters are long lasting, althoughsome also benefit (Korf, 2004). These areas are also characterized by anexodus of trained people and an absence of inward investment.
Many ecosystems are dependent on climate extremes for reproduction
(e.g., through fire and floods), disease control, and in many casesgeneral ecosystem health (e.g., fires or windstorms allowing newgrowth to replace old). How such extreme events interact with othertrends and circumstances can be critical to the outcome. For example,floods that would normally be essential to river gum reproduction may
carry disease and water weeds (Rogers and Ralph, 2010). 
Climate extremes can cause substantial mortality of individual species
and contribute to determining which species exist in ecosystems
(Parmesan et al., 2000). For example, drought plays an important role inforest dynamics, as a major influence on the mortality of trees (Villalba
and Veblen, 1997; Breshears and Allen, 2002; Breshears et al., 2005). 
4.2.2. Complex Interactions among Climate Events,
Exposure, and Vulnerability
There exist complex interactions between different climatic and non-
climatic hazards, exposure, and vulnerability that have the potential oftriggering complex, scale-dependent impacts. Anthropogenic changes in
atmospheric systems are influencing changes in many climatic variablesand the corresponding physical impacts (see Chapter 3). However, theimpacts that climatic extremes have on humans and ecosystems(including those altered by humans) depend also on several other non-climatic factors (Adger, 2006). This section will explore these factors,drawing on examples of flooding and drought. 
Changes in socioeconomic status are a key component of exposure; in
particular, population growth is a major driver behind changing exposureand vulnerability (Downton et al., 2005; Barredo, 2009). In manyregions, people have been encroaching into flood-prone areas whereeffective flood protection is not assured, due to human pressure and lackof more suitable and available land (McGranahan et al., 2007; Douglaset al., 2008). Urbanization, often driven by rural poverty, drives such
migration (Douglas et al., 2008). In these areas, both population andwealth are accumulating, thereby increasing the flood damage potential.In many developed countries, population and wealth accumulation also
occur in hazard-prone areas for reasons of lifestyle and/or lower cost(e.g., Radeloff et al., 2005). Here, a tension between climate changeadaptation and development is seen; living in these areas withoutappropriate adaptation may be maladaptive from a climate changeperspective, but this may be a risk people are willing to ta ke, or a risk
over which they have limited choice, considering their economiccircumstances (Wisner et al., 2004). Furthermore, there is often adeficient risk perception present, stemming from an unjustified faith inthe level of safety provided by flood protection systems and dikes inparticular (Grothmann and Patt, 2005) (e.g., 2005 Hurricane Katrina inNew Orleans). 
Economic development and land use change can also lead to changes
in natural systems. Land cover changes induce changes in rainfall-runoffpatterns, which can impact on flood intensity and frequency (e.g.,Kundzewicz and Schellnhuber, 2004). Deforestation, urbanization,reduction of wetlands, and river regulation (e.g., channel straightening,shortening, and embankments) change the percentage of precipitationbecoming runoff by reducing the available water storage capacity (Few,2003; Douglas et al., 2008). The proportion of impervious areas (e.g.,roofs, yards, roads, pavements, parking lots, etc.) and the value of therunoff coefficient are increased. As a result, water runs off faster torivers or the sea, and the flow hydrograph has a higher peak and ashorter time-to-peak (Cheng and Wang, 2002; Few, 2003; Douglas et al.,2008), reducing the time available for warnings and emergency action.
In mountainous areas, developments extending into hilly slopes arepotentially endangered by landslides and debris flows triggered byintense rains. These changes have resulted in rain that is less extremeleading to serious impacts (Crozier, 2010). 
Similarly, the socioeconomic impacts of droughts may arise from theinteraction between natural conditions and human water use, whichcan be conceptualized as a combination of supply and demand factors.Human activities (such as over-cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation)have exacerbated desertification of vulnerable areas in Africa and Asia,Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems239where soil and bio-productive resources became permanently degraded
(Dregne, 1986). An extreme example of a human-made, pronouncedhydrological drought comes from the Aral Sea basin in Central Asia. Dueto excessive and non-sustainable water withdrawals from thetributaries (Syr Darya and Amu Darya), their inflow into the Aral Sea hasshrunk in volume by some 75% (Micklin, 2007; Rodell et al., 2009)resulting in severe economic and ecological impacts. 
The changing impacts of climate extremes on sectors, such as water and
food, depend not only on changes in the characteristics of climate-related variables relevant to a given sector, but also on sector-relevantnon-climatic stressors, management characteristics (includingorganizational and institutional aspects), and adaptive capacity(Kundzewicz, 2003).
There also may be increasing risks from possible interactions of hazards
(Cruz, 2005; see Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 for discussion of interactionsand feedbacks). One hazard may influence other hazards or exacerbate
their effects, also with dependence on scale (Buzna et al., 2006). Forinstance, temperature rise can lead to permafrost thaw, reduced slope
stability, and damage to buildings. Another example is that intense
precipitation can lead to flash flood, landslides, and infrastructure damage,for example, collapse of bridges, roads, and buildings, and interruptionof power and water supplies. In the Philippines, two typhoons hitting
the south of Luzon Island in 2004 caused a significant flood disaster as
well as landslides on the island, leading to 900 fatalities (Pulhin et al.,
2010). It is worthwhile to note that cascading system failures (e.g.,among infrastructure) can happen rapidly and over large areas due to
their interdependent nature.
4.3. System- and Sector-Based Aspects
of Vulnerability, Exposure, and Impacts
4.3.1. Introduction
In this subsection, studies evaluating impacts and risks of extreme
events are surveyed for major affected sectors and systems. Sectors andsystems considered here include water; ecosystems; food systems andfood security; human settlements, infrastructure, and tourism; andhuman health, well-being, and security. Impacts of climate extremes aredetermined by the climate extremes themselves as well as by exposureand vulnerability. Climate extremes, exposure, and vulnerability arecharacterized by uncertainty and continuous change, and shifts in anyof these components of risk will have implications for the impacts ofextreme events. Generally, there is limited literature on the potentialfuture impacts of extreme events; most literature analyzes currentimpacts of extreme events. This focus may result in part from incompleteknowledge and uncertainties regarding future changes in some extremeevents (see, for example, Section 3.2.3 and Tables 3-1 and 3-3) as wellas from uncertainties regarding future exposure and vulnerabilities.Nonetheless, understanding current impacts can be important fordecisionmakers preparing for future risks. Analyses of both observedand projected impacts due to extreme climate and weather events areChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems
Box 4-1 | Evolution of Climate, Exposure, and Vulnerability – The Melbourne Fires, 7 February 2009
The fires in the Australian state of Victoria, on 7 February 2009, demonstrate the evolution of risk through the relationships between the
weather- and climate-related phenomena of a decade-long drought, record extreme heat, and record low humidity of 5% (Karoly, 20 10;
Trewin and Vermont, 2010) interacting with rapidly increasing exposure. Together the climate phenomena created the conditions f or
major uncontrollable wildfires (Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission, 2010).
The long antecedent drought, record heat, and a 35-day period with no rain immediately before the fires turned areas normally s een as
low to medium wildfire risk into very dry high-risk locations. A rapidly expanding urban-bush interface and valuable infrastruc ture (Berry,
2003; Burnley and Murphy, 2004; Costello, 2007, 2009) provided the values exposed and the potential for extreme impacts that wa s
realized with the loss of 173 lives and considerable tangible and intangible damage. There was a mixture of natural and human s ources
of ignition, showing that human agency can trigger such fires and extreme impacts. 
Many people were not well-prepared physically or psychologically for the fires, and this influenced the level of loss and damag e they
incurred. Levels of physical and mental health also affected people’s vulnerability. Many individuals with ongoing medical cond itions,
special needs because of their age, or other impairments struggled to cope with the extreme heat and were reliant on others to respond
safely (Handmer et al., 2010). However, capacity to recover in a general sense was high for humans and human activities throughinsurance, government support, private donations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and was variable for the affected bu sh
with some species and ecosystems benefitting (Lindenmayer et al., 2010; Banks et al., 2011; see also Case Study 9.2.2). 
Chapter 3 details projected changes in climate extremes for this region that could increase fire risk, in particular warm tempe rature
extremes, heat waves, and dryness (see Table 3-3 for summary). 240Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems
Box 4-2 | Observed and Projected Trends in Human Exposure: Tropical Cyclones and Floods
The International loss databases with global coverage such as EM-DAT, NatCat, and Sigma (maintained by the Centre for the
Epidemiology of Disasters, Munich Re, and Swiss Re, respectively) present an increase in reported disasters through time. Altho ugh the
number of reported tropical cyclone disasters, for example, has increased from a yearly average of 21.7 during the 1970s to 63 during
the 2000s (see Table 4-1), one should not simply conclude that the number of disasters is increasing due to climate change. The re are
four factors that may individually or together explain this increase: improved access to information, higher population exposur e, higher
vulnerability, and higher frequency and/or intensity of hazards (Dao and Peduzzi, 2004; Peduzzi et al., 2009). Due to uncertain ties in the
significance of the role of each of these four possible factors (especially regarding improved access to information), a vulner ability and
risk trend analysis cannot be performed based on reported losses (e.g., from EM-DAT or Munich Re). To better understand this tr end,
international loss databases would have to be standardized.
Here for both tropical cyclones and floods, we overview a method for better understanding these factors through calculation of past
trends and future projections of human exposure at regional and global scales. Changes in population size strongly influence ch anges in
exposure to hazards. It is estimated that currently about 1.15billion people live in tropical cyclone-prone areas. The physicalexposure (yearly average number of people exposed) to tropicalcyclones is estimated to have increased from approximately73 million in 1970 to approximately 123 million in 2010
(Figure 4-1; Peduzzi et al., 2011). The number of times thatcountries are hit by tropical cyclones per year is relativelysteady (between 140 and 155 countries per year

exposure and vulnerability, evaluate knowledge of current and future
risks of extreme events by sectors and systems.
4.3.2. Water
Past and future changes in exposure and vulnerability to climateextremes in the water sector are driven by both changes in the volume,
timing, and quality of available water and changes in the property, lives,and systems that use the water resource or that are exposed to water-
related hazards (Aggarwal and Singh, 2010). With a constant resourceor physical hazard, there are two opposing drivers of change in exposureand vulnerability. On the one hand, vulnerability increases as more
demands are placed on the resource (due to increased water consumption,for example, or increased discharge of polluting effluent) or exposureincreases as more property, assets, and lives encounter flooding. On theother hand, vulnerability is reduced as measures are implemented toimprove the management of resources and hazards and to enhance theability to recover from extreme events. For example, enhancing watersupplies, improving effluent treatment, and employing flood managementmeasures (including the provision of insurance or disaster relief) wouldall lead to reductions in vulnerability in the water sector. Such measureshave been widely implemented, and the runoff regime of many rivershas been considerably altered (Vörösmarty, 2002). The change in exposureand vulnerability in any place is a function of the relationship betweenChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems
maximum wind speed is likely to increase (see Section 3.4.4). Figure 4-1 provides the modeled change in human exposure at constant
hazard (without forecast of the influence of climate change on the hazard). It shows that the average number of people exposed to
tropical cyclones per year globally would increase by 11.6% from 2010 to 2030 from population growth only. In relative terms, A frica
has the largest percentage increase in physical exposure to tropical cyclones. In absolute terms, Asia has more than 90% of the  global
population exposed to tropical cyclones.
In terms of exposure to flooding, about 800 million people are currently living in flood-prone areas, and about 70 million peop le currently
living in flood-prone areas are, on average, exposed to floods each year (UNISDR, 2011). Given the lack of complete datasets on  past
flood events, and the uncertainty associated with projected trends in future flood frequencies and magnitudes (see Section 3.5. 2), it is
difficult to estimate future flood hazards. However, using population increase in the flood-prone area, it is possible to look at trends in
the number of people exposed per year on average at constant hazard (UNISDR, 2011). Figure 4-2 shows that population growth wil l
continue to increase exposure to floods. Due to model constraints, areas north of 60°N and south of 60°S, as well as catchments  smaller
than 1,000 km2(typically small islands) are not modeled. The data provided in Figure 4-2 correspond to river flooding.
A number of factors underlie increases in impacts from floods and cyclones. However, trends in the population exposed to these hazards
are an important factor. Population projections in tropical cyclone areas and flood-prone areas imply that impacts will almost certainly
continue to increase based on this factor alone.

management measures may reduce vulnerability in the short term, butincreased security may generate more development and ultimately leadto increased exposure and vulnerability. 
Extreme events considered in this section can threaten the ability of the
water supply ‘system’ (from highly managed systems with multiplesources to a single rural well) to supply water to users. This may bebecause a surplus of water affects the operation of systems, but moretypically results from a shortage of water relative to demands – adrought. Water supply shortages may be triggered by a shortage of riverflows and groundwater, deterioration in water quality, an increase indemand, or an increase in vulnerability to water shortage. There ismedium confidence that since the 1950s some regions of the world
have experienced more intense and longer droughts, in particular insouthern Europe and West Africa (see Section 3.5.1), but it is not possibleto attribute trends in the human impact of drought directly or just tothese climatic trends because of the simultaneous change in the otherdrivers of drought impact. 
There is medium confidence that the projected duration and intensity of
hydrological drought will increase in some regions with climate change(Section 3.5.1), but other factors leading to a reduction in river flows orgroundwater recharge are changes in agricultural land cover andupstream interventions. A deterioration in water quality may be drivenby climate change (as shown for example by Delpla et al., 2009;Whitehead et al., 2009; Park et al., 2010), change in land cover, orupstream human interventions. An increase in demand may be driven bydemographic, economic, technological, or cultural drivers as well as byclimate change (see Section 2.5). An increase in vulnerability to watershortage may be caused, for example, by increasing reliance on specificsources or volumes of supply, or changes in the availability of alternatives.Indicators of hydrological and water resources drought impact includelost production (of irrigated crops, industrial products, and energy), thecost of alternative or replacement water sources, and altered humanwell-being, alongside consequences for freshwater ecosystems (impactsof meteorological and agricultural droughts on production of rain-fedcrops are summarized in Section 4.3.4).
Few studies have so far been published on the effect of climate change
on the impacts of drought in water resources terms at the local catchmentscale. Virtually all of these have looked at water system supply reliabilityduring a drought, or the change in the yield expected with a givenreliability, rather than indicators such as lost production, cost, or well-being. Changes in the reliability of a given yield, or yield with a given
reliability, of course vary with local hydrological and water management
circumstances, the details of the climate scenarios used, and other
drivers of drought risk. Some studies show large potential reductions insupply reliability due to climate change that challenge existing water
management systems (e.g., Fowler et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2009; Takaraet al., 2009; Vanham et al., 2009); some show relatively small reductions
that can be managed – albeit at increased cost – by existing systems(e.g., Fowler et al., 2007), and some show that under some scenarios thereliability of supply increases (e.g., Kim and Kaluarachchi, 2009; Li et al.,
2010). While it is not currently possible to reliably project specificchanges at the catchment scale, there is high confidence that changes
in climate have the potential to seriously affect water managementsystems. However, climate change is in many instances only one of thedrivers of future changes in supply reliability, and is not necessarily themost important driver at the local scale. MacDonald et al. (2009), forexample, demonstrate that the future reliability of small-scale rural watersources in Africa is largely determined by local demands, biologicalaspects of water quality, or access constraints, rather than changes inregional recharge, because domestic supply requires only 3-10 mm of
recharge per year. However, they noted that up to 90 million people in
low rainfall areas (200-500 mm) would be at risk if rainfall reduces tothe point at which groundwater resources become nonrenewable.
There have been several continental- or global-scale assessments of
potential change in hydrometeorological drought indicators (seeSection 3.5.1), but relatively few on measures of water resourcesdrought or drought impacts. This is because these impacts are verydependent on context. One published large-scale assessment (Lehner etal., 2006) used a generalized drought deficit volume indicator, calculatedby comparing simulated river flows with estimated withdrawals formunicipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. The indicator was calculatedacross Europe, using climate change projections from two climatemodels and assuming changes in withdrawals over time. They showedsubstantial changes in the return period of the drought deficit volume,comparing the 100-year return period for the 1961-1990 period withprojections for the 2070s (Figure 4-3). Across large parts of Europe, the1961-1990 100-year drought deficit volume is projected to have areturn period of less than 10 years by the 2070s. Lehner et al. (2006)also demonstrated that this projected pattern of change was generallydriven by changes in climate, rather than the projected changes inwithdrawals of water (Figure 4-3). In southern and western Europe,changing withdrawals alone only are projected to increase deficitvolumes by less than 5%, whereas the combined effect of changingwithdrawals and climate change is projected to increase deficit volumesby at least 10%, and frequently by more than 25%. In eastern Europe,increasing withdrawals are projected to increase drought deficitvolumes by over 5%, and more than 10% across large areas, but this isoffset under both climate scenarios by increasing runoff.
Climate change has the potential to change river flood characteristics
through changing the volume and timing of precipitation, by altering theproportions of precipitation falling as snow and rain, and to a lesserextent, by changing evaporation and hence accumulated soil moisturedeficits. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude,frequency, and direction of change in flood characteristics (Section3.5.2). Changes in catchment surface characteristics (such as landcover), floodplain storage, and the river network can also lead tochanges in the physical characteristics of river floods (e.g., along theRhine: Bronstert et al., 2007). The impacts of extreme flood eventsinclude direct effects on livelihoods, property, health, production, andcommunication, together with indirect effects of these consequences
Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems243through the wider economy. There have, however, been very few studies
that have looked explicitly at the human impacts of changes in floodfrequency, rather than at changes in flood frequencies and magnitudes.One study has so far looked at changes in the area inundated by floodswith defined return periods (Veijalainen et al., 2010), showing that therelationship between change in flood magnitude and flood extentdepended strongly on local topographic conditions.
An early study in the United States (Choi and Fisher, 2003) constructed
regression relationships between annual flood loss and socioeconomicand climate drivers, concluding that a 1% increase in average annual
precipitation would, other things being equal, lead to an increase inannual national flood loss of around 6.5%. However, the conclusionsare highly dependent on the regression methodology used, and thespatial scale of analysis. More sophisticated analyses combine estimatesof current and future damage potential (as represented by a damage-magnitude relationship) with estimates of current and future floodfrequency curves to estimate event damages and average annual damages(sometimes termed expected annual damage). For example, Mokrech etal. (2008) estimated damages caused by the current 10- and 75-yearChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems

The two main conclusions from their work were as follows. First, thepercentage change in cost was greater for the rarer event than the morefrequent event. Second, the absolute value of impacts, and therefore thepercentage change from current impacts, was found to be highlydependent on the assumed socioeconomic change. In one region, eventdamage varied, in monetary terms, between four and five times acrosssocioeconomic scenarios. An even wider range in estimated averageannual damage was found in the UK Foresight Future Flooding andCoastal Defence project (Evans et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2005), whichcalculated average annual damage in 2080 of £1.5 billion, £5 billion, and£21 billion under similar climate scenarios but different socioeconomicfutures (current average annual damage was estimated at £1 billion).The Foresight project represented the effect of climate change on floodfrequency by altering the shape of the flood frequency curve usingprecipitation outputs from climate models and rainfall-runoff models fora sample of UK catchments. The EU-funded Projection of Economicimpacts of climate change in Sectors of the European Union based onboTtom-up Analysis (PESETA) project (Ciscar, 2009; Feyen et al., 2009)used a hydrological model to simulate river flows, flooded areas, and floodfrequency curves from climate scenarios derived from regional climatemodels, but – in contrast to the UK Foresight project – assumed nochange in economic development in flood-prone areas. Figure 4-4summarizes estimated changes in the average annual number of peopleflooded and average annual damage, by European region (Ciscar, 2009).There are strong regional variations in impact, with particularly largeprojected increases in both number of people flooded and economicdamage (over 200%) in central and Eastern Europe, while in parts ofNorth Eastern Europe, average annual flood damages decrease. 
At the global scale, two studies have estimated the numbers of people
affected by increases (or decreases) in flood hazard. Kleinen and Petschel-Held (2007) calculated the percentage of population living in river basinswhere the return period of the current 50-year event becomes shorter,for three climate models and a range of increases in global meantemperature. With an increase in global mean temperature of 2°C (abovelate 20th-century temperatures), between (approximately) 5 and 27%of the world’s population would live in river basins where the current
50-year return period flood occurs at least twice as frequently. Hirabayashi
and Kanae (2009) used a different metric, counting each year the numberof people living in grid cells where the flood peak exceeded the (current)
100-year magnitude, using runoff as simulated by a high-resolution
climate model fed through a river routing model. Beyond 2060, theyfound that at least 300 million people could be affected by substantial
flooding even in years with relatively low flooding, with of the order of
twice as many being flooded in flood-rich years (note that they used
only one climate scenario with one climate model). This compares with
a current range (using the same index) of between 20 and 300 million
people. The largest part of the projected increase is due to increases in
the occurrence of floods, rather than increases in population.
The impacts of changes in flood characteristics are highly dependent on
how climate changes in the future, and as noted in Section 3.5.2, thereis low confidence in projections of changes in flood magnitude or
frequency. However, based on the available literature, there is high
confidence that, in some places, climate change has the potential to
substantially affect flood losses.
4.3.3. Ecosystems
Available information shows that high temperature extremes (i.e., heatwave), drought, and floods substantially affect ecosystems. Increasinggaps and overall contraction of the distribution range for specieshabitat could result from increases in the frequency of large-scaledisturbances due to extreme weather and climate events (Opdam andWascher, 2004). Fischlin et al. (2007), from assessment of 19 studies,found that 20 to 30% of studied plant and animal species may be at anincreased risk of extinction if warming exceeds 2 to 3°C above thepreindustrial level. Changes due to climate extremes could also entailshifts of ecosystems to less-desired states (Scheffer et al., 2001; Chapinet al., 2004; Folke et al., 2004) through, for example, the exceedance ofcritical temperature thresholds, with potential loss of ecosystem servicesdependent on the previous state (Reid et al., 2005; see also Fischlin etal., 2007). 
4.3.3.1. Heat Waves
Heat waves can directly impact ecosystems by, for example, constrainingcarbon and nitrogen cycling and reducing water availability, with theresult of potentially decreasing production or even causing speciesmortality.
Warming can decrease net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO
2) exchange
by inducing drought that suppresses net primary productivity. Morefrequent warm years may lead to a sustained decrease in CO
2uptake by
terrestrial ecosystems (Arnone et al., 2008). Extreme temperatureconditions can shift forest ecosystems from being a net carbon sink tobeing a net carbon source. For example, tall-grass prairie net ecosystemCO
2exchange levels decreased in both an extreme warming year
(2003) and the following year in grassland monoliths from centralOklahoma, United States (Arnone et al., 2008). A 30% reduction in grossprimary productivity together with decreased ecosystem respirationover Europe during the heat wave in 2003 resulted in a strong netsource of CO
2(0.5 Pg C yr-1) to the atmosphere and reversed the effect
of four years of net ecosystem carbon sequestration. Such a reductionin Europe’s primary productivity is unprecedented during the last century(Ciais et al., 2005). 
Impacts are determined not only by the magnitude of warming but also
by organisms’ physiological sensitivity to that warming and by theirability to compensate behaviorally and physiologically. For example,warming may affect tropical forest lizards’ physiological performance insummer, as well as their ability to compete with warm-adapted, open-habitat competitors (Huey et al., 2009).

thus influencing survival during extreme heat events (McKechnie andWolf, 2010). Heat waves could also cause increased likelihood ofcatastrophic avian mortality events (McKechnie and Wolf, 2010). 
4.3.3.2. Drought
A rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody plants at asubcontinental scale was triggered by the 2000–2003 drought insouthwestern North America. Following 15 months of diminished soilwater content, more than 90% of the dominant tree species, Pinus edulis ,
died. Limited observations indicate that die-off was more extensive than
during the previous drought of the 1950s, also affecting wetter siteswithin the tree species’ distribution (Breshears et al., 2005). Regional-scale piñon pine mortality was observed following an extended drought(2000–2004) in northern New Mexico (Rich et al., 2008). Dominantplant species from diverse habitat types (i.e., riparian, chaparral, andlow-to high-elevation forests) exhibited significant mortality during adrought in the southwestern United States; average mortality amongdominant species was 3.3 to 41.4% (Gitlin et al., 2006).
Evergreen coniferous species mortality caused by the coupling of drought
and higher temperatures from winter to spring has been observed in theRepublic of Korea (Lim et al., 2010). In 1998, 2002, 2007, and 2009, yearsof high winter-spring temperatures and lower precipitation, P . densiflora
and P . koraiensis were affected by droughts, with many dying in the
crown layer, while deciduous species survived. Similarly, Abies koreana ,
an endemic species in Korea, at high elevation has declined following arise in winter temperatures since the late 1990s (Lim et al., 2010). Beechcrown condition was observed to decline following severe drought in1976 (Power, 1994), 1989 (Innes, 1992), and 1990 (Stribley andAshmore, 2002). Similarly, the percentage of moderately or severelydamaged trees displayed an upward trend after the 1989 drought inCentral Italy, especially for P . pinea and Fagus sylvatica (Bussotti et al.,
1995). As final examples, defoliation and mortality in Scots pine observedin each year during 1996 to 2002 was related to the precipitation deficitand hot conditions of the previous year in the largest inner-alpine
valley of Switzerland (Valais) (Rebetez and Dobbertin, 2004), and both
gross primary production and total ecosystem respiration decreased in2003 in many regions of Europe (Granier et al., 2007).
In a shallow temperate southern European estuary, the Mondego Estuary
in Portugal, the severe drought in 2004–2005 was responsible for
spatial shifts in the estuary’s zooplankton community, with an increase
in abundance and diversity during the period of low freshwater flow
(Marques et al., 2007). 
4.3.3.3. Floods
Floods also impact ecosystems. Floods can cause population- andcommunity-level changes superimposed on a background of moregradual trends (Thibault and Brown, 2008). As an example, an extreme
flood event affected a desert rodent community (that had beenmonitored for 30 years) by inducing a large mortality rate, eliminatingthe advantage of previously dominant species, resetting long-termpopulation and community trends, altering competitive and meta-population dynamics, and reorganizing the community (Thibault andBrown, 2008). 
4.3.3.4. Other Events
Other events, such as hurricanes and storms, can also impact ecosystems.Hurricanes can cause widespread mortality of wild birds, and theiraftermath may cause declines due to the birds’ loss of resourcesrequired for foraging and breeding (Wiley and Wunderle, 1994). Winter
storms can also impact forest ecosystems, particularly in pre-alpine and
alpine areas (Faccio, 2003; Schelhaas et al., 2003; Fuhrer et al., 2006). Inaddition, saltmarshes, mangroves, and coral reefs can be vulnerable toclimate extremes (e.g., Bertness and Ewanchuk, 2002; Hughes et al.,2003; Fischlin et al., 2007).
4.3.4. Food Systems and Food Security
Food systems and food security can be affected by extreme events thatimpair food production and food storage and delivery systems (foodlogistics). Impacts transmitted through an increase in the price of foodcan be especially challenging for the urban poor in developing countries(FAO, 2008). Global food price increases are borne disproportionally bylow-income countries, where people spend more of their income onfood (OECD-FAO, 2008).
When agricultural production is not consumed where it is produced, it
must be transported and often processed and stored. This processinvolves complex interdependent supply chains exposed to multiplehazards. At every step of the process, transport and associatedinfrastructure such as roads, railways, bridges, warehouses, airports,ports, and tunnels can be at risk of direct damage from climateevents, making the processing and delivery chain as a whole at risk ofdisruption resulting from damage or blockages at any point in thechain. 
The economies of many developing countries rely heavily on agriculture,
dominated by small-scale and subsistence farming. People’s livelihoodsin this sector are especially exposed to weather extremes (Easterlingand Apps, 2005; Easterling et al., 2007). Subsistence farmers can beseverely impacted by climate and weather events. For example, themajority of households produce maize in many African countries, butonly a modest proportion sells it – the great majority eat all theyproduce. In Kenya for example, nearly all households grow maize, butonly 36% sell it, with 20% accounting for the majority of sales (FAO,2009). Both such famers and their governments have limited capacityfor recovery (Easterling and Apps, 2005). Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems247Evidence that the current warming trends around the world have
already begun to impact agriculture is reported by Lobell et al. (2011). Theyshow that crop yields have already declined due to warmer conditionscompared to the expected yields without warming. Both Schlenker andRoberts (2009) and Muller et al. (2011), after their evaluation of projectedtemperature effects on crops in the United States and Africa, concludedthat climate change would have negative impacts on crop yields. Theseeffects were based on temperature trends and an expected increase inthe probability of extremes during the growing season; however, thereis also the potential occurrence of extreme events after the crop isgrown, which could affect harvest and grain quality. Fallon and Betts(2010) stated that increasing flooding and drought risks could affectagricultural production and require the adoption of robust managementpractices to offset these negative impacts. Their analysis for Europeshowed a probable increase in crop productivity in northern regionsbut a decrease in the southern regions, leading to a greater disparity inproduction. 
In a recent evaluation of high temperature as a component of climate
trends, Battisti and Naylor (2009) concluded that future growing seasontemperatures are very likely to exceed the most extreme temperatures
observed from 1900 to 2006, for both tropical and subtropical regions,with substantial potential implications for food systems around the world. 
The effects of temperature extremes on a number of different crop
species have been summarized in Hatfield et al. (2011). Many crops areespecially sensitive to extreme temperatures that occur just prior to orduring the critical pollination phase of crop growth (Wheeler et al., 2000;Hatfield et al., 2008, 2011). Crop sensitivity and ability to compensateduring later improved weather will depend on the length of time foranthesis in each crop. 
Extreme temperatures can negatively impact grain yield (Kim et al.,
1996; Prasad et al., 2006). For example, Tian et al. (2010) observed in ricethat high temperatures (>35°C) coupled with high humidity and lowwind speed caused panicle temperatures to be as much as 4°C higherthan air temperature, inducing floret sterility. Impacts of temperatureextremes may not be limited to daytime events. Mohammed and Tarpley(2009) observed that rice yields were reduced by 90% when nighttemperatures were increased from 27 to 32°C. An additional impact of
extremes has been found in the quality of the grain. Kettlewell et al.(1999) found that wheat quality in the United Kingdom was related tothe North Atlantic Oscillation and probably caused by variation inrainfall during the grain-filling period. In a more recent study, Hurkman
et al. (2009) observed that high-temperature events during grain-filling
of wheat altered the protein content of the grain, and these responses
were dependent upon whether the exposure was imposed early ormidway through the grain-filling period. Skylas et al. (2002) observed thathigh temperature during grain-filling was one of the most significant
factors affecting both yield and flour quality in wheat.
Drought causes yield variation, and an example from Europe demonstrates
that historical yield records show that drought has been a primary causeof interannual yield variation (Hlavinka et al., 2009; Hatfield, 2010).
Water supply for agricultural production will be critical to sustainproduction and even more important to provide the increase in foodproduction required to sustain the world’s growing population. Withglaciers retreating due to global warming and El Niño episodes, theAndean region faces increasing threats to its water supply (Mark andSeltzer, 2003; Cadier et al., 2007). With precipitation limited to only a fewmonths of the year, melt from glaciers is the only significant source ofwater during the dry season (Mark and Seltzer, 2003). Glacier recessionreduces the buffering role of glaciers, hence inducing more floods duringthe rainy season and more water shortages during the dry season.Cadier et al. (2007) found that warm anomalies of the El Niño-SouthernOscillation (ENSO) corresponded to an increase in melting four monthslater.
Food security is linked to our ability to adapt agricultural systems to
extreme events using our understanding of the complex system ofproduction, logistics, utilization of the produce, and the socioeconomicstructure of the community. The spatial variability and context sensitivityof each of these factors points to the value of downscaled scenarios ofclimate change and extreme events.
4.3.5. Human Settlements, Infrastructure, and Tourism
4.3.5.1. Human Settlements
Settlements concentrate the exposure of humans, their assets, and their
activities. In the case of very large cities, these concentrations canrepresent a significant proportion of national wealth and may result inadditional forms of vulnerability (Mitchell, 1998). Flooding, landslides,storms, heat waves, and wildfires have produced historically importantdamages in human settlements, and the characteristics of these eventsand their underlying climate drivers are projected to change (seeChapter 3; Kovats and Akhtar, 2008; Satterthwaite, 2008). Theconcentration of economic assets and people creates the possibilityof large impacts, but also the capacity for recovery (Cutter et al.,2008). Coastal settlements are especially at risk with sea level riseand changes in coastal storm activity (see Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5and Case Study 9.2.8).
At very high risk of impacts are the urban poor in informal settlements
(Satterthwaite, 2008; Douglas, 2009). Worldwide, about one billionpeople live in informal settlements, and informal settlements aregrowing faster than formal settlements (UN-HABITAT, 2008; UNISDR,2011). Informal settlements are also found in developed countries; forexample, there are about 50 million people in such areas in Europe(UNECE, 2009). Occupants of informal settlements are typically moreexposed to climate events with no or limited hazard-reducinginfrastructure. The vulnerability is high due to very low-quality housingand limited capacity to cope due to a lack of assets, insurance, andmarginal livelihoods, with less state support and limited legal protection(Dodman and Satterthwaite, 2008). Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems248The number and size of coastal settlements and their associated
infrastructure have increased significantly over recent decades(McGranahan et al., 2007; Hanson et al., 2011; see also Case Study9.2.8). In many cases these settlements have affected the ability ofnatural coastal systems to respond effectively to extreme climate eventsby, for example, removing the protection provided by sand dunes andmangroves. Small island states, particularly small island developingstates (see Case Study 9.2.9), may face substantial impacts from climatechange-related extremes.
Urbanization exacerbates the negative effects of flooding through
greatly increased runoff concentration, peak, and volume, the increasedoccupation of flood plains, and often inadequate drainage planning(McGranahan et al., 2007; Douglas et al., 2008). These urbanizationissues are universal but often at their worst in informal settlements,which are generally the most exposed to flooding and usually do nothave the capacity to deal with the issues (Hardoy et al., 2001). Floodingregularly disrupts cities, and urban food production can be severelyaffected by flooding, undermining local food security in poor communities(Douglas, 2009; Aggarwal and Singh, 2010). A further concern for low-and middle-income cities as a result of flooding, particularly in developingcountries, is human waste, as most of these cities are not served byproper water services such as sewers, drains, or solid waste collectionservices (Hardoy et al., 2001). 
Slope failure can affect settlements in tropical mountainous areas,
particularly in deforested areas (e.g., Vanacker et al., 2003)and hillyareas (Loveridge et al., 2010), and especially following heavy prolongedrain (e.g., see Case Study 9.2.5). Informal settlements are often exposedto potential slope failure as they are often located on unstable land withno engineering or drainage works (Alexander, 2005; Anderson et al.,2007). Informal settlements have been disproportionately badly impactedby landslides in Colombia and Venezuela in the past (e.g., Takahashi etal., 2001; Ojeda and Donnelly, 2006) and were similarly affected in 2010during unusual heavy rains associated with the La Niña weatherphenomenon (NCDC, 2011). Densely settled regions in the Alps (Crostaet al., 2004) and Himalayas have been similarly impacted (Petley et al.,2007).
Cities can substantially increase local temperatures and reduce
temperature drop at night (e.g., see Case Study 9.2.1). This is the urban
heat island effect resulting from the large amount of heat-absorbing
material, building characteristics, and emissions of anthropogenic heat
from air conditioning units and vehicles (e.g., Rizwan et al., 2008; for acritical review of heat island research, see Stewart, 2011). Heat wavescombined with urban heat islands (Basara et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2010)can result in large death tolls with the elderly, the unwell, the socially
isolated, and outdoor workers (Maloney and Forbes, 2011) being
especially vulnerable, although acclimatization and heat health-warning
systems can substantially reduce excess deaths (Fouillet et al., 2008).
Heat waves thus pose a future challenge for major cities (e.g., Endlicher
et al., 2008; Bacciniet al., 2011; for London, Wilby, 2003). In urban areas,heat waves also have negative effects on air quality and the number ofdays with high pollutants, ground level ozone, and suspended particle
concentrations (Casimiro and Calheiros, 2002; Sanderson et al., 2003;Langner et al., 2005). 
The largest impacts from coastal inundation due to sea level rise (and/or
relative sea level rise) in low-elevation coastal zones (i.e., coastal areaswith an elevation less than 10 m above present mean sea level; seeMcGranahan et al., 2007) are thought to be associated with extremesea levels due to tropical and extratropical storms (e.g., Ebersole et al.,2010; Mozumder et al., 2011) that will be superimposed upon the long-term sea level rise (e.g., Frazier et al., 2010). An increase in the meanmaximum wind speed of tropical cyclones is likely over the 21st century,
but possibly not in all ocean basins (see Table 3-1). The destructivepotential of tropical cyclones may increase in some regions as a resultof this projected increase in intensity of mean maximum wind speedand tropical cyclone-related rainfall rates (see Section 3.4.4). Stormsgenerally result in considerable disruption and local destruction, butcyclones and their associated storm surges have in some cases causedvery substantial destruction in modern cities (e.g., New Orleans andDarwin; see also Case Study 9.2.5). The impacts are considered to bemore severe for large urban centers built on deltas and small islandstates (McGranahan et al., 2007; Love et al., 2010; Wardekker et al.,2010), particularly for those at the low end of the international incomedistribution (Dasgupta et al., 2009). The details of exposure will becontrolled by the natural or human-induced characteristics of the system,for example, the occurrence/distribution of protecting barrier islandsand/or coastal wetlands that may attenuate surges (see, e.g., Irish et al.,2010; Wamsley et al., 2010) or changes such as land reclamation (Guoet al., 2009). Recent studies (Nicholls et al., 2008; Hanson et al., 2011)have assessed the asset exposure of port cities with more than onemillion inhabitants (in 2005). They demonstrated that large populationsare already exposed to coastal inundation (~40 million people or 0.6%of the global population) by a 1-in-100-year extreme event, while thetotal value of exposed assets was estimated at US$ 3,000 billion (~ 5%of the global GDP in 2005). By the 2070s, population exposure wasestimated to triple, whereas asset exposure could grow tenfold to someUS$ 35,000 billion; these estimates, however, do not account for thepotential construction of effective coastal protection schemes (see alsoDawson et al., 2005), with the exposure growth rate being more rapid indeveloping countries (e.g., Adamo, 2010). Lenton et al. (2009) estimated asubstantial increase in the exposure of coastal populations to inundation(see Figure 4-5).
4.3.5.2. Infrastructure
Weather- and climate-related extremes are expected to produce largeimpacts on infrastructure, although detailed analyses of potential andprojected damages are limited to a few countries (e.g., Australia,Canada, the United States; Holper et al., 2007), infrastructure types(e.g., power lines), and sectors (e.g., transport, tourism). Inadequateinfrastructure design may increase the impacts of climate and weatherextremes, and some infrastructure may become inadequate where cli mateChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems249change alters the frequency and severity of extremes, for example, an
increase in heavy rainfalls may affect the capacity and maintenance ofstorm water, drainage, and sewerage infrastructure (Douglas et al., 2008).In some infrastructure, secondary risks in case of extreme weather maycause additional hazards (e.g., extreme rainfall can damage dams). Thesame is true for industrial and mining installations containing hazardoussubstances (e.g., heavy rainfall is the main cause of tailings dam failure,accounting for 25% of incidents worldwide and 35% in Europe; Rico etal., 2008).
In many parts of the world, including Central Asia and parts of Europe,
aging infrastructure, high operating costs, low responsiveness tocustomers, and poor access to capital markets may limit the operabilityof sewerage systems (Evans and Webster, 2008). Moreover, most urbancenters in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia have no sewers (Hardoy et al.,2001). Current problems of pollution and flooding will be exacerbatedby an increase in climatic and weather extremes (e.g., intense rainfall;
see Table 3-3 for projected regional changes). 
Major settlements are dependent on lengthy infrastructure networks for
water, power, telecommunications, transport, and trade, which are exposedto a wide range of extreme events (e.g., heavy precipitation and snow,
gale winds). Modern logistics systems are intended to minimize slack
and redundancies and as a result are particularly vulnerable to disruptionby extreme events (Love et al., 2010). 
Transport infrastructure is vulnerable to extremes in temperature,
precipitation/river floods, and storm surges, which can lead to damagein roads, rail, airports, and ports. Impacts on coastal infrastructure, onservices, and particularly on ports, key nodes of international supply
chains, are expected (e.g., Oh and Reuveny, 2010). This may have far-reaching implications for international trade, as more than 80% of globaltrade in goods (by volume) is carried by sea (UNCTAD, 2009). All coastalmodes of transportation are considered vulnerable, but exposure andimpacts will vary, for example, by region, mode of transportation, location/elevation, and condition of transport infrastructure (NRC, 2008; UNCTAD,2009). Coastal inundation due to storm surges and river floods can affectterminals, intermodal facilities, freight villages, storage areas, and cargoand disrupt intermodal supply chains and transport connectivity (seeFigure 4-6). These effects would be of particular concern to small islandstates, whose transportation facilities are mostly located in low-elevationcoastal zones (UNCTAD, 2009; for further examples, see Love et al., 2010).
Regarding road infrastructure, Meyer (2008) pointed to bridges and
culverts as vulnerable elements in areas with projected increases inheavy precipitation. Moreover, the lifetime of these rigid structures islonger than average road surfaces and they are costly to repair orreplace. Increased temperatures could reduce the lifetime of asphalt onroad surfaces (Meizhu et al., 2010). Extreme temperature may causeexpansion and increased movement of concrete joints, protectivecladding, coatings, and sealants on bridges and airport infrastructure,impose stresses in the steel in bridges, and disrupt rail travel (e.g., Arkelland Darch, 2006). Nevertheless, roads and railways are typically replacedevery 20 years and can accommodate climate change at the time ofreplacement (Meyer, 2008).
Electricity transmission infrastructure is also vulnerable to extreme
storm events, particularly wind and lightning, and in some cases heatChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems

storms across France in 1999 caused the greatest devastation to anelectricity supply network ever seen in a developed country, as 120high-voltage transmission pylons were toppled, and 36 high-tensiontransmission lines (one-quarter of the total lines in France) were lost(Abraham et al., 2000). Severe droughts may also affect the supply ofcooling water to power plants, disrupting the ongoing supply of power(see Box 4-4; Rübbelke and Vögele, 2011). 
Buildings and urban facilities may be vulnerable to increasing frequency
of heavy precipitation events (see Section 3.3.2). Those close to thecoast are particularly at risk when storm surges are combined with sealevel rise. In commercial buildings, vulnerable elements are lightweight
roofs commonly used for warehouses, causing water spoilage to stored
goods and equipment. During the Lothar and Martin storms, the mostvulnerable public facilities were schools, particularly those built in the
1960s and 1970s and during the 1990s with the use of lightweightarchitectural elements of metal, plastic, and glass in walls and roofs
(Abraham et al., 2000). 
4.3.5.3. Tourism
The tourism sector is highly sensitive to climate, since climate is the
principal driver of global seasonality in tourism demand (Lise and Tol,2002; Becken and Hay, 2007). Approximately 10% of global GDP isspent on recreation and tourism, constituting a major source of income
and foreign currency in many developing countries (Berrittella et al.,2006). Extreme events may play an important role in tourist decisions
(e.g., Hein et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009).
There are three broad categories of impacts of climate extremes that
can affect tourism destinations, competitiveness, and sustainability (Scottet al., 2008): (1) direct impacts on tourist infrastructure (hotels, accessroads, etc.), on operating costs (heating/cooling, snowmaking, irrigation,food and water supply, evacuation, and insurance costs), on emergencypreparedness requirements, and on business disruption (e.g., sun-and-seaor winter sports holidays); (2) indirect environmental change impactsof extreme events on biodiversity and landscape change (e.g., coastalerosion), which may negatively affect the quality and attractiveness oftourism destinations; and (3) tourism-adverse perception of particulartouristic regions after occurrence of the extreme event itself. For example,adverse weather conditions or the occurrence of an extreme event canreduce a touristic region’s popularity among tourists during the followingseason.
Apart from extreme events, large impacts on some tourist destinations
may be produced by medium-term projected climate change effects (e.g.,Bigano et al., 2008). Salinization of the groundwater resources due tosea level rise, land reclamation, and overexploitation of coastal aquifers(e.g., Alpa, 2009) as well as changing weather extreme patterns (Heinet al., 2009) will pose additional stresses for the industry. Nevertheless,the potential impacts on the tourist industry will depend also ontourists’ perceptions of the coastal destinations (e.g., of destinationsexperiencing beach erosion) that, however, cannot be easily predicted(Buzinde et al., 2009). Capacity to recover is related to the degree ofChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems

(Ehmer and Heymann, 2008). However, low-lying coastal areas and areascurrently on the edge of the snow limit may have limited alternatives.Some ski resorts will be able to adapt using snowmaking, which hasbecome an integral component of the ski industry in Europe (Elsasserand Bürki, 2002), although at the expense of high water and energyconsumption.
In some regions, the main impact of extreme events on tourism is decline
in revenue, with loss of livelihoods for those working in the sector(Hamilton et al., 2005; Scott et al., 2008; Hein et al., 2009). Quantitativeregional climate projections of the frequency or magnitude of certainweather and climate extremes (e.g., heat waves and droughts; see, forexample, Table 3-3) inform qualitative understanding of regional impactson tourism activities (see Box 4-3). The vulnerable hotspot regions interms of extreme impacts of climate change on tourism include theMediterranean, Caribbean, small islands of the Indian and Pacific
Oceans, and Australia and New Zealand (Scott et al., 2008). Direct andindirect effects of extremes in these regions will vary greatly withlocation (Gössling and Hall, 2006a,b; Wilbanks et al., 2007).
Box 4-3 points out a number of potential climate extreme impacts on
tourism regions and activities.
4.3.6. Human Health, Well-Being, and Security
Climate extremes, such as heat waves, floods, droughts, and cyclones,influence human health, well-being, and security. 
Heat waves have affected developed countries, as exemplified by the
2003 European heat wave (see Case Study 9.2.1 and Box 4-4). In muchChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems
Box 4-3 | Regional Examples of Potential Impacts of Climate Extremes on Tourism
Tropics
Projections indicate a likely increase in mean maximum wind speed (but not in all basins) and in tropical cyclone-related rainfall rates
(see Table 3-1). In the Caribbean, tourist activities may be reduced where beaches erode with sea level rise and where coral is  bleached,
impacting snorkelers and divers (Uyarra et al., 2005). 
Small island states are dependent on tourism, and the tourism infrastructure that lies on the coast is threatened by climate ch ange
(Berrittella et al., 2006). Sea level rise in the 20th century – with an average rate of 1.7 mm yr-1and a significantly higher rate
(3.1 mm yr-1) for the period 1993–2003 (Bindoff et al., 2007) – poses risks for many touristic resorts of small islands in the Pacific and
Indian Oceans (Becken and Hay, 2007; Scott et al., 2008).
Alpine Regions
Warming temperatures will raise the snowline elevation (Elsasser and Bürki, 2002; Scott et al., 2006). In Switzerland, only 44%  of ski
resorts are projected to be above the ‘snow-reliable’ altitude (snow for 100 days per season) by approximately 2030, as opposed  to 85%
today (Elsasser and Bürki, 2002). In Austria, 83% of ski resorts are currently snow-reliable but an increase in temperature of 1 and 2°C is
projected to reduce this number to 67 and 50%, respectively (Abegg et al., 2007). Ski season simulations show that snowmakingtechnology can maintain snow-reliable conditions in Austria until the 2040s (A1B) to the 2050s (B1), but by the end of the cent ury the
required production in snow volume is projected to increase by up to 330% (Steiger, 2010). This artificial snow production will  increase
vulnerability to water shortage and local water conflicts, in particular in the French Alps (EEA, 2009).
Mediterranean Countries
More frequent heat waves and tropical nights (>20°C) in summer (see Table 3-3) may lead to exceedance of comfortable temperatur e
levels and reduce the touristic flow by 2060 (Hein et al., 2009). Tourism occupancy may increase during spring and autumn and d ecrease
in summer (Perry, 2003; Esteban-Talaya et al., 2005). Northern European countries are expected to become relatively more attrac tive,
closing their gap with the currently popular southern European countries (Hamilton et al., 2005).
There are major regional gaps in understanding how climate change may affect the natural and cultural resources in Africa and S outh
America, preventing further insight on corresponding impacts for tourism activities (Scott et al., 2008).
In many regions, some types of tourism will benefit from, or be unaffected by, climate extremes (Scott et al., 2008). When an a rea is
impacted directly by an extreme event, tourists will often go to another destination with the result that one area’s loss becom es another’s
gain. The impacted area may also gain in the longer term through the provision of new infrastructure. City and cultural tourism  is
generally seen as relatively unaffected by climate and weather events (Scott et al., 2008).252of the developed world, societies are aging and hence can be more
sensitive to climate extremes, such as heat waves (Hennessy et al.,2007). Heat extremes can claim casualties even in tropical countries,where people are acclimatized to the hot climate; McMichael et al.(2008) evaluated the relation between daily temperature and mortalityin middle- and low-income countries, and reported that higher mortalitywas observed on very hot days in most of the cities, including tropicalcities, such as Bangkok, Thailand; Delhi, India; and Salvador, Brazil.
Floods can cause deaths and injuries and can be followed by infectious
diseases (such as diarrhea) and malnutrition due to crop damage (seeSection 4.4.2.3). In Dhaka, Bangladesh, the severe flood in 1998 wasassociated with an increase in diarrhea during and after the flood, andthe risk of non-cholera diarrhea was higher among those from a lowersocioeconomic group and not using tap water (Hashizume et al., 2008).Floods may also lead to a geographical shift of malaria epidemicregions by changing breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Outbreaks ofmalaria were associated with changes in habitat after the 1991 floods inCosta Rica’s Atlantic region (Saenz et al., 1995; for another example, seeCase Study 9.2.6). Malaria epidemics can also occur when people withlittle immunity move into endemic regions, although the displacementof large populations has rarely occurred as a result of acute naturaldisasters (Toole, 1997). 
Drought can affect water security, as well as food security through
reduction of agricultural production (MacDonald, 2010), and it can be afactor contributing to human-ignited forest fires, which can lead towidespread deforestation and carbon emissions (D’Almeida et al., 2007;van der Werf et al., 2008; Field et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2009; Costaand Pires, 2010). Also, drought can increase or decrease the prevalenceof mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as malaria, depending on thelocal conditions (Githeko et al., 2000), and is associated with meningitis(Molesworth et al., 2003). Studies indicate that there is a climate signalin forest fires throughout the American West and Canada and that thereis a projected increase in severe wildfires in many areas (Gillett et al.,2004; W esterling et al., 2006; Westerling and Bryant, 2008). As described
by McMichael et al. (2003a), the direct effects of fire on human healthcan include burns and smoke inhalation, with indirect health impacts
potentially resulting from loss of vegetation on slopes, increased soilerosion, and resulting increased risk of landslides.
Evaluation of how impacts of climate extremes affect human health tend
to focus on the direct, immediate effects of the event, using parameters
that are often easier to obtain and quantify like death statistics or
hospitalizations. These direct observable outcomes are used todemonstrate the extremity of an event and as a comparison metric to
measure against other extreme events. However, indirect health impacts
are not often reported, because they are one step removed from the
event. Because indirect impacts are hard to monitor and are often
temporally separated from the event, they are effectively removed from
the cause-and-effect linkage to that event. Examples of indirect health
impacts from extreme weather events include illnesses or injury resultingfrom disruption of human infrastructure built to deal with basic needs likemedical services; exposure to infectious or toxic agents after an extreme
event like cyclones or flooding (Schmid et al., 2005); stress, anxiety, andmental illness after evacuation or geographical displacement (Fritze etal., 2008) as well as increased susceptibility to infection (Yee et al.,2007); and disruption of socioeconomic structures and food productionthat leads to increases of malnutrition that might not manifest untilmonths after an extreme event (Haines et al., 2006; McMichael et al.,2006). Indirect health impacts are therefore a potentially large butunder-examined outcome of extreme weather events that lead to asubstantial underestimation of the total health burden.
There is a growing body of evidence that the mental health impact from
extreme events is substantial (Neria et al., 2008; Berry et al., 2010).Often overshadowed by the physical health outcomes of an event, thepsychological effects can be long lasting and can affect a large portion ofa population (Morrissey and Reser, 2007). An extreme event may affectmental health directly from acute traumatic stress from an event, withcommon outcomes of anxiety and depression. It can also have indirectimpacts during the recovery period associated with the stress andchallenges of loss, disruption, and displacement. Furthermore, indirectmental health impacts could even affect individuals not directly associatedwith an event, like grieving friends and family of those who die from anevent or the rescue and aid workers who suffer post-traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD) after their aid efforts. Long-term mental health impactsare not often adequately monitored, but the body of research conductedafter natural disasters in the past three decades suggests that the burdenof PTSD among persons exposed to disasters is substantial (Neria et al.,2008). A range of other stress-related problems such as grief, depression,anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse(Fritze et al., 2008) have lasting effects, long after the causative event.
There remain large limitations in evaluating health impacts of climate
change. The largest research gap is a lack of information on impactoutcomes themselves in developing countries in general. This includes themortality/morbidity data and information on other contributing factorssuch as nutritional status or access to safe water and medical facilities. 
4.4. Regionally Based Aspects of
Vulnerability, Exposure, and Impacts
4.4.1. Introduction
The regional subsections presented here discuss the impacts of extreme
weather and climate events within the context of other issues andtrends. Regional perspective, in social and economic dimensions, isimportant especially since decisionmaking often has a strong regionalcontext. For a comprehensive assessment of observed and projectedregional changes in climate extremes, see Sections 3.3 to 3.5 andTables 3-2 and 3-3.
For various climate extremes, the following aspects are considered on a
regional basis: exposure of humans and their activities to given climateChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems253extremes; the vulnerability of what is exposed to the climate extreme;
and the resulting impacts. The individual sections below are structuredas is most logical for the trends relevant to each region. 
4.4.2. Africa
4.4.2.1. Introduction
Climate extremes exert a significant control on the day-to-day economic
development of Africa, particularly in traditional rain-fed agricultureand pastoralism, and water resources, at all scales
. Floods and droughts
can cause major human and environmental impacts on and disruptions
to the economies of African countries, thus exacerbating vulnerability(AMCEN/UNEP , 2002; Scholes and Biggs, 2004; Washington et al., 2004;
Thornton et al., 2006). There is still limited scientific information availableon observed frequency and projections of many extreme events in Africa(e.g., see Tables 3-2 and 3-3), despite frequent reporting of such events,including their impacts. 
Agriculture as an economic sector is most vulnerable and most exposed
to climate extremes in Africa. It contributes approximately 50% toAfrica’s total export value and approximately 21% of its total GDP(Mendelsohn et al., 2000; PACJA, 2009). In particular, with an inefficientagriculture industry, sub-Saharan Africa is extremely vulnerable to climateextremes. This vulnerability is exacerbated by poor health, education, andgovernance standards (Brooks et al., 2005). Reid et al. (2007) projectclimate impacts on Namibia’s natural resources that would cause annuallosses of 1 to 6% of GDP , of which livestock production, traditionalagriculture, and fishing are expected to be hardest hit, with a combinedloss of US$ 461 to 2,045 million per year by 2050.
4.4.2.2. Droughts and Heat Waves
An overall increase in dryness in Africa has been observed ( medium
confidence ), with prolonged Sahel drought, but regional variability is
observed (see Table 3-2). Droughts have affected the Sahel, the Horn of
Africa, and Southern Africa particularly since the end of the 1960s
(Richard et al., 2001; L’Hôte et al., 2002; Brooks, 2004; Christensen et al.,
2007; Trenberth et al., 2007). One of the main consequences of multi-
year drought periods is severe famine, such as the one associated withthe drought in the Sahel in the 1980s, causing many casualties and
important socioeconomic losses. The people in Africa who live in
drought-prone areas are vulnerable to the direct impacts of droughts(e.g., famine, death of cattle, soil salinization), as well as indirect
impacts (e.g., illnesses such as cholera and malaria) (Few et al., 2004).
The water sector is strongly influenced by, and sensitive to, periods of
prolonged drought conditions in a continent with limited water storage
infrastructure. Natural water reservoirs such as lakes  experiencea marked interannual water level fluctuation related to rainfall interannualvariability (Nicholson et al., 2000; Verschuren et al., 2000). Large changes in hydrology and water resources linked to climate
variability have led to water stress conditions in human and ecologicalsystems in a number of African countries (Schulze et al., 2001; New, 2002;Legesse et al., 2003; Eriksen et al., 2005; de Wit and Stankiewicz, 2006;Nkomo and Bernard, 2006). Twenty-five percent of the contemporaryAfrican population has limited water availability and thus constitutes adrought-sensitive population, whereas 69% of the population experiencesrelative water abundance (Vörösmarty et al., 2005). Even for this latterpart of the population, however, relative abundance does not necessarilycorrespond to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and thiseffective reduction of the quantity of freshwater available for human usenegatively affects vulnerability. Despite the considerable improvementsin access to freshwater in the 1990s, only about 62% of the Africanpopulation had access to improved water supplies in 2000 (WHO/UNICEF , 2000). As water demand increases, the population exposed todifferent drought conditions (agricultural, climate, urban) is expected toincrease as well.
Increasing drought risk may cause a decline in tourism, fisheries, and
cropping (UNWTO, 2003). This could reduce the revenue available togovernments, enterprises, and individuals, and hence further deterioratethe capacity for adaptation investment. For example, the 2003-2004drought cost the Namibian Government N$ 275 million (US$ 43-48million) in provision of emergency relief (Reid et al., 2007). Cameroon’seconomy is highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture; a 14% reduction inrainfall is projected to cause significant losses, of up to US$ 4.56 billion(Molua and Lambi, 2006).
4.4.2.3. Extreme Rainfall Events and Floods
There are inconsistent patterns of change in heavy precipitation inAfrica and partial lack of data; hence there is low confidence in
observed precipitation trends (see Table 3-2). Heavy precipitation mayinduce landslides and debris flows in tropical mountain regions (Thomas
and Thorp, 2003) with potential impacts for human settlements. In thearid and semi-arid areas of countries of the Horn of Africa, extremerainfall events are often associated with a higher risk of the vector andepidemic diseases of malaria, dengue fever, cholera, Rift Valley fever,and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (Anyamba et al., 2006; McMichaelet al., 2006). 
The periods of extreme rainfall and recurrent floods seem to correlate
with the El Niño phase (Reason and Kiebel, 2004; Reason et al., 2005;Washington and Preston, 2006; Christensen et al., 2007) of ENSO events(e.g., 1982-1983, 1997-1998, 2006-2007). When such events occur,important economic and human losses result. In 2000, floods inMozambique (see Case Study 9.2.6), particularly along the valleys of therivers Limpopo, Save, and Zambezi, resulted in 700 reported deaths andabout half a million homeless. The floods had a devastating effect onlivelihoods, destroying agricultural crops, disrupting electricity supplies,and demolishing basic infrastructure (Osman-Elasha et al., 2006).However, floods can be highly beneficial in African drylands (e.g.,Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems254Sahara and Namib Deserts) since the floodwaters infiltrate and recharge
alluvial aquifers along ephemeral river pathways, extending wateravailability to dry seasons and drought years (Morin et al., 2009; Benitoet al., 2010), and supporting riparian systems and human communities(e.g., Walvis Bay in Namibia). 
Damage to African port cities from flooding, storm surge, and high winds
might increase due to climate change. F or instance, it is indicated that in
Alexandria, US$ 563.28 billion worth of assets could suffer damageor be lost because of coastal flooding alone by 2070 (Nicholls et al.,2008).
4.4.2.4. Dust Storms
Atmospheric dust is a major element of the Saharan and Sahelianenvironments. The Sahara Desert is the world’s largest source ofairborne mineral dust, which is transported over large distances,traversing northern Africa and adjacent regions and depositing dust onother continents (Osman-Elasha et al., 2006; Moulin et al., 1997). Duststorms have negative impacts on agriculture, health, and structures.They erode fertile soil; uproot young plants; bury water canals, homes,and properties; and cause respiratory problems. Meningitis transmissionis associated with dust in semi-arid conditions and overcrowded livingconditions. The frequency of dust events has increased in the Sahelzone, but studies of observations and in particular studies of projectionsof dust activity are limited (see Section 3.5.8).
4.4.3. Asia
Asia includes mega-deltas, which are susceptible to extreme impacts dueto a combination of the following factors: high-hazard rivers, coastalflooding, and increased population exposure from expanding urbanareas with large proportions of high vulnerability groups (Nicholls et al.,2007). Asia can also expect changes in the frequency and magnitude ofextreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves and heavyprecipitation (see, e.g., Table 3-3). Such changes may have ramifications
not only for physical and natural systems but also for human systems. 
4.4.3.1. Tropical Cyclones (Typhoons or Hurricanes)
Damage due to storm surge is sensitive to any changes in the magnitude
of tropical cyclones (Xiao and Xiao, 2010). For example, changes in
storm surge and associated damage were projected for the inner parts
of three major bays (Tokyo, Ise, and Osaka) in Japan (Suzuki, 2009). The
projections were based on calculations of inundations for different sea
levels and different strengths of typhoons, using a spatial model withinformation on topography and levees. The research indicated that atyphoon that is 1.3 times as strong as the design standard with a sealevel rise of 60 cm would cause damage costs of about US$ 3, 40, and27 billion, respectively, in the investigated bays.Awareness, improved governance, and development are essential in
coping with extreme tropical cyclone and typhoon events in developingAsian countries (Cruz et al., 2007). For example, two cyclones in theIndian Ocean (Sidr and Nargis) of similar magnitude and strengthcaused a significantly different number of fatalities. A comparison ispresented in Case Study 9.2.5.
For the period from 1983 to 2006, the direct economic losses in China
increased, but there is no trend if the losses are normalized by annualtotal GDP and GDP per capita, suggesting Chinese economic developmentcontributed to the upward trend. This hypothesis is consistent with dataon tropical cyclone casualties, which showed no significant trend overthe 24 years (Zhang et al., 2009). Similarly, normalized losses fromtyphoons on the Indian southeast coast since 1977 show no increases(Raghavan and Rajesh, 2003).
4.4.3.2. Flooding
The geographical distribution of flood risk is heavily concentrated inIndia, Bangladesh, and China, causing high human and material losses(Brouwer et al., 2007; Dash et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2008). Regardingthe occurrence of the extreme events themselves, different floodingtrends have been detected and projected in various catchments, but theevidence for broader regional trends is limited (see Section 3.5.2). 
In July 2005, severe flooding occurred in Mumbai, India, after 944 mm
of rain fell in a 24-hour period (Kshirsagar et al., 2006). The consequentflooding affected households, even in more affluent neighborhoods.Poor urban drainage systems in many parts of India can be easilyblocked. Ranger et al. (2011) analyzed risk from heavy rainfall in the city ofMumbai, concluding that total losses (direct plus indirect) for a 1-in-100year event could triple by the 2080s compared with the present(increasing from US$ 700 to 2,305 million), and that adaptation couldhelp reduce future damages.
As noted in the final report for the Ministry of Environment and Forest
(2005) of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, flooding in Bangladeshis a normal, frequently recurrent, phenomenon. Bangladesh experiencesfour types of floods: flash floods from the overflowing of hilly rivers; rainfloods due to poor drainage; monsoon floods in the flood plains ofmajor rivers; and coastal floods following storm surge. In a normal year,river spills and drainage congestions cause inundation of 20 to 25% ofthe country’s area. Inundation areas for 10-, 50-, and 100-year floodsconstitute 37, 52, and 60% of the country’s area, respectively. In 1987,1988, and 1998, floods inundated more than 60% of the country.The 1998 flood alone led to 1,100 deaths, caused inundation of nearly100,000 km
2, left 30 million people homeless, and substantially
damaged infrastructure. 
There have been increases in flood impacts associated with changes in
surrounding environments. Flooding has increased over the past fewdecades in the Poyang La ke, South China, due to levee constructionChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems255protecting a large rural population (Shankman et al., 2006). Such levees
reduce the area for floodwater storage, leading to higher lake stagesduring the summer flood season and then levee failures. The mostextreme floods occurred during or immediately following El Niño events(Shankman et al., 2006). Fengqing et al. (2005) analyzed losses fromflooding in the Xinjiang autonomous region of China, and found anincrease that seems to be linked to changes in rainfall and flash floodssince 1987.
Heavy rainfall and flooding also affect environmental health in urban
areas because surface water can be quickly contaminated. Urban poorpopulations in low- and middle-income countries can experience higherrates of infectious disease after floods, such as cholera, cryptosporidiosis,and typhoid fever (Kovats and Akhtar, 2008). 
4.4.3.3. Temperature Extremes
Increases in warm days/nights and heat wave duration, frequency,and/or intensity are observed and projected in Asia (see Tables 3-2 and3-3), with adverse impacts on both human and natural system s. In 2002,
a heat wave was reported to have killed 622 people in the southernIndian state of Andhra Pradesh. Persons living in informal settlementsand structures are more exposed to high temperatures (Kovats andAkhtar, 2008). 
Agriculture is also affected directly by temperature extremes. For example,
rice, the staple food in many parts of Asia, is adversely affected byextremely high temperature, especially prior to or during critical pollinationphases (see Section 4.3.4).
4.4.3.4. Droughts
Asia has a long history of drought, which has been linked with otherclimate extremes. Spatially varying trends have been observed duringthe second half of the 20th century, with increasing dryness noted insome areas, particularly in East Asia (see Table 3-2), adversely affectingsocioeconomic, agricultural, and environmental conditions. Drought
causes water shortages, crop failures, starvation, and wildfire. 
In Southeast Asia, El Niño is associated with comparatively dry
conditions: 93% of droughts in Indonesia between 1830 and 1953occurred during El Niño years (Quinn et al., 1978). In four El Niño years
between 1973 and 1992, the average annual rainfall amounted to onlyaround 67% of the 20-year average in two major rice growing areas in
Java, Indonesia, causing a yield decline of approximately 50% (Amienet al., 1996).
During drought, severe water scarcity results from one of, or a
combination of, the following mechanisms: insufficient precipitation;
high evapotranspiration; and over-exploitation of water resources
(Bhuiyan et al., 2006). About 15% (23 million ha) of Asian rice areas experience frequent yield
loss due to drought (Widawsky and O’Toole, 1990). The problem isparticularly pertinent to eastern India, where the area of drought-pronefields exceeds more than 10 million ha (Pandey et al., 2000). Even whenthe total rainfall is adequate, shortages during critical periods reduce
yield (Kumar et al., 2007). Lowland rice production in the Mekong
region is generally reduced because crops are cultivated under rain-fedconditions, rather than irrigated, and often exposed to drought. InCambodia, severe drought that affects grain yield mostly occurs late inthe growing season, and longer-duration genotypes are more likely toencounter drought during grain filling (Tsubo et al., 2009).
Asian wetlands provide resources to people in inundation areas, who
are susceptible to droughts. For achieving the benefits from fertilizationfor inundation agriculture in Cambodia, wide areas along the riversneed to be flooded (Kazama et al., 2009). Flood protection in this areaneeds to consider this benefit of inundation.
4.4.3.5. Wildfires
Grassland fire disaster is a critical problem in China (Su and Liu, 2004;Zhang et al., 2006), especially in northwestern and northeastern Chinadue to expansive territory and complex physiognomy. Statistical analysisof historical grassland fire disaster data has suggested a gradualincrease in grassland fire disasters with economic development andpopulation growth in 12 northern provinces of China between 1991 and2006 (Liu et al., 2006).
In tropical Asia, although humans are igniting the fires, droughts are
predisposing factors for fire occurrence (Field et al., 2009). Droughtepisodes, forest fires, drainage of rice fields, and oil palm plantations aredrying peatlands, which are then more susceptible to fires (van der Werfet al., 2008). Peatland fires are an important issue given the difficultiesof extinguishing them and their potential effects on climate. 
4.4.4. Central and South America
4.4.4.1. Extreme Rainfalls in South America
Extreme rainfall episodes have caused disasters in parts of South
America, with hundreds to thousands of fatalities in mudslides andlandslides, as typified, for example, by the December 1999 incident inVenezuela (Lyon, 2003). However, there is lowto medium confidence in
observed (Table 3-2) and in projected (Table 3-3) changes in heavyprecipitation in the region.
4.4.4.2. Wildfires
There is a lowto medium confidence in projections of trends in dryness
in South America (see Table 3-3). Magrin et al. (2007) indicated thatChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems256more frequent wildfires are probable (an increase in frequency of 60%
for a temperature increase of 3°C) in much of South America. In most ofcentral and northern Mexico, the semi-arid vegetation could be replacedby the vegetation of arid regions (Villers and Trejo, 2004). Due to theinterrelated nature of forest fires, deforestation, drought, and climatechange, isolating one of the processes fails to describe the complexityof the interconnected whole. 
4.4.4.3. Regional Costs
Climatic disasters account for the majority of natural disasters in CentralAmerica, with most of its territory located in tropical and equatorial areas.Low-lying states are especially vulnerable to hurricanes and tropicalstorms. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch, one of the most powerful
hurricanes of the tropical Atlantic Basin of the 20th century, caused
direct and indirect damages to Honduras of US$ 5 billion, equivalent to95% of Honduras’ 1998 GDP (Cardemil et al., 2000). Some literatureindicates that hurricane losses, when corrected for population andwealth in Latin America and the Caribbean, have not increased since the1940s (Pielke Jr. et al., 2003); and that increasing population and assetsat risk are the main reason for increasing impacts. 
4.4.5. Europe
4.4.5.1. Introduction
This section assesses vulnerability and exposure to climate extremes in
Europe, evaluating observed and projected impacts, disasters, and risks.Europe has a higher population density and lower birth rate than anyother continent. It currently has an aging population; life expectancyis high and increasing, and child mortality is low and decreasing(Eurostat, 2010). European exposure to climate- and weather-relatedhazards has increased whereas vulnerability has decreased as a resultof implementation of policy, regulations, and risk prevention andmanagement (EEA, 2008; UNISDR, 2009). 
4.4.5.2. Heat Waves
Summer heat waves have increased in frequency and duration in most
of Europe (Section 3.3.1 and Table 3-2) and have affected vulnerablesegments of European society. During the 2003 heat wave, several tensof thousands of additional heat-related deaths were recorded (see Case
Study 9.2.1 and Box 4-4). Urban heat islands pose an additional risk tourban inhabitants. Those most affected are the elderly, ill, and socially
isolated (Kunst et al., 1993; Laschewski and Jendritzky, 2002; seeCase Study 9.2.1). There are mounting concerns about increasing heatintensity in major European cities (Wilby, 2003) because of the large
population that inhabits urban areas. Building characteristics, emissions
of anthropogenic heat from air conditioning units and vehicles, as well
as lack of green open areas in some parts of the cities, may exacerbateheat load during heat waves (e.g., Stedman, 2004; Wilby, 2007).
However, as high summer temperatures and urban heat waves becomemore common, populations are able to adapt to such ‘expected’temperature conditions, decreasing mortality during subsequent heatwaves (Fouillet et al., 2008). 
4.4.5.3. Droughts and Wildfires
Drought risk is a function of the frequency, severity, and spatial andtemporal extent of dry spells and of the vulnerability and exposure of apopulation and its economic activity (Lehner et al., 2006). InMediterranean countries, droughts can lead to economic damageslarger than floods or earthquakes (e.g., the drought in Spain in 1990affected 6 million people and caused material losses of US$ 4.5 billion;after CRED, 2010). The most severe human consequences of droughtsare often found in semiarid regions where water availability is alreadylow under normal conditions, water demand is close to, or exceeds,natural availability, and/or society lacks the capacity to mitigate oradapt to drought (Iglesias et al., 2009). Direct drought impacts affectall forms of water supply (municipal, industrial, and agricultural).Other sectors and systems affected by drought occurrence arehydropower generation, tourism, forestry, and terrestrial and aquaticecosystems. 
Forest fire danger (length of season, frequency, and severity) depends
on the occurrence of drought. There is medium confidence in observed
changes in drought in Europe (Table 3-2). Projections indicate increasingdryness in central Europe and the Mediterranean, with no major changein Northern Europe ( medium confidence ) (see Table 3-3). In the
Mediterranean, an increase in dryness may lead to increased dominanceof shrubs over trees (Mouillot et al., 2002); however, it does not translatedirectly into increased fire occurrence or changes in vegetation (Thonickeand Cramer, 2006). Analysis of post-fire forest resilience contributes toidentifying ‘risk hotspots’ where post-fire management measuresshould be applied as a priority (Arianoutsou et al., 2011). 
4.4.5.4. Coastal Flooding
Coastal flooding is an important natural disaster, since many Europeanslive near the coasts. Storm surges can be activated as a result of wind-driven waves and winter storms (Smith et al., 2000), whereas long-termprocesses are linked to global mean sea level rise (Woodworth et al.,2005). Locations currently experiencing adverse impacts such as coastalerosion and inundation will continue to do so in the future (see Section3.5.5). Expected sea level rise is projected to have impacts on Europe’scoastal areas including land loss, groundwater and soil salinization, anddamage to property and infrastructure (Devoy, 2008). Hinkel et al.(2010) found that the total monetary damage in coastal areas of theMember Countries of the European Union caused by flooding, salinityintrusion, land erosion, and migration is projected to rise withoutadaptation by 2100 to roughly € 17 billion per year under the A2 andChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems257B1 emission scenarios. The Netherlands is an example of a country that
is highly susceptible to both sea level rise and coastal flooding, withdamage costs relative to GDP of up to 0.3% of GDP under the A2scenario (Hinkel et al., 2010). By 2100, adaptation can reduce thenumber of people flooded by two orders of magnitude and the totaldamage costs by a factor of seven to nine (Hinkel et al., 2010). 
4.4.5.5. Gale Winds
Storms have been one of the most important climate hazards for the
insurance industry in Europe (Munich Re NatCatSERVICE data cited in
EEA, 2008). In the most severe extratropical windstorm month,December 1999, when three events struck Europe (Anatol – December 3,
Denmark; Lothar – December 26, France, Germany, and Switzerland;and Martin – December 28, France, Spain, and Italy), insured damage
was in excess of US$ 12 billion (Schwierz et al., 2010). Typical economiclosses were generated by gale winds via effects on electrical distribution
systems, transportation, and communication lines; by damage tovulnerable elements of buildings (e.g., lightweight roofs); and by treesfalling on houses. Some researchers have found no contribution from
climate change to trends in the economic losses from floods in Europesince the 1970s (Barredo, 2009). Some studies have found evidence ofincreasing damages to forests in Sweden and Switzerland (Nilsson etal., 2004; Usbeck et al., 2010). Still other studies assert that increases inforest disturbances in Europe are mostly due to changes in forestmanagement (e.g., Schelhaas et al., 2003).
There is medium confidence in projected poleward shifts of mid-latitude
storm tracks but low confidence in detailed regional projections (see
Section 3.4.5). According to a study by Swiss Re (2009), if by the end ofthis century once-in-a-millennium storm surge events strike northernEurope every 30 years, this could potentially result in a disproportionateincrease in annual expected losses from a current € 0.6 to 2.6 billion byend of the century. Similar results are obtained from global and regionalclimate models run under the IPCC SRES A1B emission scenario (Donatet al., 2010). Adaptation to the changing wind climate may reduce byhalf the estimated losses (Leckebusch et al., 2007; Donat et al., 2010),indicating that adaptation through adequate sea defenses and themanagement of residual risk is beneficial.Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems
Box 4-4 | Extraordinary Heat Wave in Europe, Summer 2003
The extraordinarily severe heat wave over large parts of the European continent in the summer of 2003 produced record-breakingtemperatures particularly during June and August (Beniston, 2004; Schär et al., 2004). Average summer (June to August) temperat ures
were by up to five standard deviations above the long-term mean, implying that this was an extremely unusual event (Schär andJendritzky, 2004). Regional climate model simulations suggest the 2003 heat wave bears resemblance to summer temperatures in th e
late 21st century under the A2 scenario (Beniston, 2004). 
Electricity demand increased with the high heat levels. Additionally, drought conditions created stress on health, water suppli es, food
storage, and energy systems; for example, reduced river flows reduced the cooling efficiency of thermal power plants (conventio nal and
nuclear), and six power plants were shut down completely (Létard et al., 2004). Many major rivers (e.g., the Po, Rhine, Loir e, and Danube)
were at record low levels, resulting in disruption of inland navigation and irrigation, as well as power plant cooling (Benisto n and Díaz,
2004; Zebisch et al., 2005). In France, electricity became scarce, construction productivity fell, and the cold storage systems  of approxi mately
20 to 30% of all food-related establishments were found to be inadequate (Létard et al., 2004). The (uninsured) economic losses  for the
agriculture sector in the European Union were estimated at € 13 billion (Sénat, 2004). A record drop in crop yield of 36% occur red in
Italy for maize grown in the Po valley, where extremely high temperatures prevailed (Ciais et al., 2005). The hot and dry condi tions led to
many very large wildfires. Glacier melting in the Alps prevented even lower river flows in the Danube and Rhine (Fink et al., 2 004). 
Health and health service-related impacts of the heat wave were dramatic, with excess deaths of about 35,000 (Kosatsky, 2005). Elderly
people were among those most affected (WHO, 2003; Borrell et al., 2006; Kovats and Ebi, 2006), but deaths were also associated with
housing and social conditions, for example, being socially isolated or living on the top floor (Vandentorren et al., 2006). The  high mortality
during the 2003 heat wave marked an inflexion point in public awareness of the dangers of high temperatures, conducive to incre asing
the preventive measures set up by health institutions and authorities (Koppe et al., 2004; Pascal et al., 2006).
During the July 2006 heat wave, about 2,000 excess deaths occurred in France (Rey et al., 2007). The excess mortality during th e 2006
heat wave was markedly lower than that predicted by Fouillet et al. (2008) based on the quantitative association between temper ature
and mortality observed during 1975-2003. Fouillet et al. (2008) interpreted this mortality reduction (~4,400 deaths) as a decre ase in the
population’s vulnerability to heat, together with increased awareness of the risk related to extreme temperatures, preventive m easures,
and the warning system established after the 2003 heat wave. 2584.4.5.6. Flooding
Flooding is the most frequent natural disaster in Europe (EEA, 2008).
Economic losses from flood hazards in Europe have increased considerablyover previous decades (Lugeri et al., 2010), and increasing exposure ofpeople and economic assets is probably the major cause of the long-
term changes in economic disaster losses (Barredo, 2009). Exposure is
influenced by socioeconomic development, urbanization, and infrastructureconstruction on flood-prone areas. Large flood impacts have been causedby a few individual flood events (e.g., the 1997 floods in Poland andCzech Republic, the 2002 floods in much of Europe, and the 2007 summerfloods in the United Kingdom). The projected increase in frequency andintensity of heavy precipitation over large parts of Europe (Table 3-3) mayincrease the probability of flash floods, which pose the highest risk offatality (EEA, 2004). Particularly vulnerable are new urban developmentsand tourist facilities, such as camping and recreation areas (e.g., a largeflash flood in 1996 in the Spanish Pyrenees, conveying a large amountof water and debris to a camping site, resulted in 86 fatalities; Benito etal., 1998). Apart from new developed urban areas, linear infrastructure,such as roads, railroads, and underground rails with inadequate drainage,will probably suffer flood damage (DEFRA, 2004; Arkell and Darch, 2006).Increased runoff volumes may increase risk of dam failure (small waterreservoirs and tailings dams) with high environmental and socioeconomicdamages as evidenced by historical records (Rico et al., 2008).
In glaciated areas of Europe, glacial lake outburst floods, although
infrequent, have the potential to produce immense socioeconomic andenvironmental impacts. Glacial lakes dammed by young, unstable, andunconsolidated moraines, and lakes in contact with the active ice bodyof a glacier, increase the potential of triggering an event (e.g., Huggel etal., 2004). Intense lake level and dam stability monitoring on most glaciallakes in Europe helps prevent major breach catastrophes. In case offlooding, major impacts are expected on infrastructure and settlementseven at long distances downstream from the hazard source area(Haeberli et al., 2001; Huggel et al., 2004). 
4.4.5.7. Landslides
There is a general lack of information on trends in landslide activity, and
for regions with reasonably well-established databases (e.g., Switzerland),significant trends have not been found in the number of events andimpacts (Hilker et al., 2009). Reactivation of large movements usually
occurs in areas with groundwater flow and river erosion. In southernEurope the risk is reduced through revegetation on scree slopes, which
enhances cohesion and slope stability coupled with improved hazard
mitigation (Corominas, 2005; Clarke and Rendell, 2006). 
4.4.5.8. Snow
Snow avalanches are an ever-present hazard with the potential for loss
of life, property damage, and disruption of transportation. Due to anincreased use of mountainous areas for recreation and tourism, there is
increased exposure for the population leading to an increased rate ofmortality due to snow avalanches. During the period 1983 to 2003,avalanche fatalities have averaged about 25 per year in Switzerland(McClung and Schaerer, 2006). In economic terms, direct losses related toavalanches are small (Voigt et al., 2010), although short-term reactions bytourists may result in a reduction in overnight stays one year after adisaster (Nöthiger and Elsasser, 2004). Increased winter precipitationmay result in higher than average snow depth or duration of snowcover, which could contribute to avalanche formation (Schneebeli et al.,1997). Climate change impacts on snow cover also include decreases inits duration, depth, and extent and a possible altitudinal shift of thesnow/rain limit (Beniston et al., 2003), with adverse consequences towinter tourism. Increased avalanche occurrence would have a negativeimpact on humans (loss of life and infrastructure) but could have apositive result in mountain forests due to higher biodiversity within theaffected areas (Bebi et al., 2009). 
4.4.6. North America
4.4.6.1. Introduction
North America (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) is relatively well
developed, although differentiation in living standards exists across andwithin countries. This differentiation in adaptive capacity, combinedwith a decentralized and essentially reactive response capability,underlies the region’s vulnerability (Field et al., 2007). Furthermore,population trends within the region have increased vulnerability byheightening exposure of people and property in areas that are affectedby extreme events. For example, population in coastline regions of theGulf of Mexico region in the United States increased by 150% from1960 to 2008, while total US population increased by 70% (U.S. CensusBureau, 2010).
4.4.6.2. Heat Waves
For North America, there is medium confidenc e in observations (Table 3-2)
and high confidence in projections (Table 3-3) of increasing trends in
heat wave frequency and duration.
Heat waves have impacts on many sectors, most notably on human health,
agriculture, forestry and natural ecosystems, and energy infrastructure.One of the most significant concerns is human health, in particularmortality and morbidity. In 2006 in California, at least 140 deaths andmore than 1,000 hospitalizations were recorded during a severe heatwave (CDHS, 2007; Knowlton et al., 2008). In 1995 in Chicago, morethan 700 people died during a severe heat wave. Following that 1995event, the city  developed a series of response measures through anextreme heat program. In 1999, the city experienced another extremeheat event but far fewer lives were lost. While conditions in the 1999event were somewhat less severe, the city’s response measures wereChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems259also credited with contributing to the lower mortality (Palecki et al.,
2001). 
While heat waves are projected to increase in intensity and duration
(Table 3-3), their net effect on human health is uncertain, largely becauseof uncertainties about the structure of cities in the future, adaptationmeasures, and access to cooling (Ebi and Meehl, 2007). Many citieshave installed heat watch warning systems. Several studies show thatthe sensitivity of the population of large US cities to extreme heatevents has been declining over time (e.g., Davis et al., 2003; Kalksteinet al., 2011).
Heat waves have other effects. There is increased likelihood of disruption
of electricity supplies during heat waves (Wilbanks et al., 2008). Airquality can be reduced, particularly if stagnant high-pressure systemsincrease in frequency and intensity (Wang and Angell, 1999).Additionally, extreme heat can reduce yields of grain crops such as cornand increase stress on livestock (Karl et al., 2009).
4.4.6.3. Drought and Wildfire
There is medium confidence in an overall slight decrease in dryness
since 1950 across the continent, with regional variability (Table 3-2).For some regions of North America, there is medium confidence in
projections of increasing dryness (Table 3-3).
Droughts are currently the third most costly category of natural disaster
in the United States (Carter et al., 2008). The effects of drought includereduced water quantity and quality, lower streamflows, decreased cropproduction, ecosystem shifts, and increased wildfire risk. The severity ofimpacts of drought is related to the exposure and vulnerability ofaffected regions.
From 2000 to 2010, excluding 2003, crop losses accounted for nearly all
direct damages resulting from US droughts (NWS, 2011). Similarly,drought has had regular recurring impacts on agricultural activities inNorthern Mexico (Endfield and Tejedo, 2006). In addition to impacts oncrops and pastures, droughts have been identified as causes of regional-scale ecosystem shifts throughout southwestern North America (Allen
and Breshears, 1998; Breshears et al., 2005; Rehfeldt et al., 2006). 
Drought also has multiple indirect impacts in North America, although
they are more difficult to quantify. Droughts pose a risk to North
American power supplies due to associated reliance on sufficient watersupplies for hydropower generation and cooling of nuclear, coal, and
natural gas generation facilities (Goldstein, 2003; Wilbanks et al., 2008).Studies of water availability in heavily contested reservoir systems such
as the Colorado River Basin indicate that climate change is projected toreduce states’ abilities to meet existing agreements (Christensen et al.,2004). The effects of climate change on the reliability of the water
supply have been thoroughly explored by Barnett and Pierce (2008,
2009). Additionally, droughts and dry conditions more generally have been
linked to increases in wildfire activity in North America. Westerling et al.(2006) found that wildfire activity in the western United States increasedsubstantially in the late 20th century and that the increase is caused byhigher temperatures and earlier snowmelt. Similarly, increases in wildfireactivity in Alaska from 1950 to 2003 have been linked to increasedtemperatures (Karl et al., 2009). Anthropogenic warming was identifiedas a contributor to increases in Canadian wildfires (Gillett et al., 2004).
In Canada, forest fires are responsible for one-third of all particulate
emissions, leading to heightened incidence of respiratory and cardiac
illnesses as well as mortality (Rittmaster et al., 2006). Wildfires not onlycause direct mortality, but the air pollution produces increases in eyeand respiratory illnesses (Ebi et al., 2008). The principal economic costsof wildfires include timber losses, property destruction, fire suppression,and reductions in the tourism sector (Butry et al., 2001; Morton et al., 2003).
4.4.6.4. Inland Flooding
There has been a likely increase in heavy precipitation in many areas of
North America since 1950 (Table 3-2), with projections suggestingfurther increases in heavy precipitation in some regions (Table 3-3).Flooding and heavy precipitation events have a variety of significantdirect and indirect human health impacts (Ebi et al., 2008). Heavyprecipitation events are strongly correlated with the outbreak ofwaterborne illnesses in the United States – 51% of waterborne diseaseoutbreaks were preceded by precipitation events in the top decile(Curriero et al., 2001). In addition, heavy precipitation events have beenlinked to North American outbreaks of vector-borne diseases such asHantavirus and plague (Engelthaler et al., 1999; Parmenter et al., 1999;Hjelle and Glass, 2000).
Beyond direct destruction of property, flooding has important negative
impacts on a variety of economic sectors including transportation andagriculture. Heavy precipitation and field flooding in agricultural systemsdelays spring planting, increases soil compaction, and causes crop lossesthrough anoxia and root diseases; variation in precipitation is responsiblefor the majority of the crop losses (Mendelsohn, 2007). In 1993, heavyprecipitation flooded 8.2 million acres (~3.3 million ha) of AmericanMidwest soybean and corn fields, leading to a 50% decrease in corn yieldsin Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri, and a 20 to 30% decrease in Illinois,Indiana, and Wisconsin (Changnon, 1996). Furthermore, flood impactsinclude temporary damage or permanent destruction of infrastructurefor most modes of transportation (Zimmerman and Faris, 2010). Forexample, heavy precipitation events are a very costly weather conditionfacing US rail transportation (Changnon, 2006).
4.4.6.5. Coastal Storms and Flooding
Global observed and projected changes in coastal storms and floodingare complex. Since 1950, there has been a likely increase in extreme seaChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems260level, related to trends in mean sea level. With upward trends in sea
level very likely to continue (Section 3.5.3), there is high confidence that
locations currently experiencing coastal erosion and inundation willcontinue to do so in the future (Section 3.5.5).
North America is exposed to coastal storms, and in particular, hurricanes.
2005 was a particularly severe year with 14 hurricanes (out of 27 namedstorms) in the Atlantic (NCDC, 2005). There were more than 2,000 deathsduring 2005 (Karl et al., 2009) and widespread destruction on the GulfCoast and in New Orleans in particular. Property damages exceededUS$ 100 billion (Beven et al., 2008; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008). HurricanesKatrina and Rita destroyed more than 100 oil and gas platforms in theGulf and damaged 558 pipelines, halted all oil and gas production in theGulf, and disrupted 20% of US refining capacity (Karl et al., 2009). It isreported that the direct overall losses of Hurricane Katrina were aboutUS$ 138 billion in 2007 dollars (Spranger, 2008). However, 2005 may bean outlier for a variety of reasons – the year saw storms of higher thanaverage frequency, with greater than average intensity, which mademore frequent landfall, including in the most vulnerable region of thecountry (Nordhaus, 2010). The major factor increasing the vulnerabilityand exposure of North America to hurricanes is the growth in population(see, e.g., Pielke Jr. et al., 2008) and increase in property values, particularlyalong the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States. While some ofthis increase has been offset by adaptation and improved buildingcodes, Nordhaus (2010) suggests the ratio of hurricane damages tonational GDP has increased by 1.5% per year over the past half-century.However, the choice of start and end dates influences this figure.
Future sea level rise and potential increases in storm surge could
increase inundation and property damage in coastal areas. Hoffman etal. (2010) assumed no acceleration in the current rate of sea level risethrough 2030 and found that property damage from hurricanes wouldincrease by 20%. Frey et al. (2010) simulated the combined effects ofsea level rise and more powerful hurricanes on storm surge in southernTexas in the 2080s. They found that the area inundated by storm surgecould increase from 6-25% to 60-230% across scenarios evaluated. Noadaptation measures were assumed in either study. Globally, uncertaintiesassociated with changes in tropical and extratropical cyclones mean
that a general assessment of the projected effects of storminess onfuture storm surge is not currently possible (Section 3.5.3).
4.4.7. Oceania
The region of Oceania consists of Australia, New Zealand, and several
small island states that are considered separately in Section 4.4.10.
4.4.7.1. Introduction
Extreme events have severe impacts in both Australia and New Zealand.
In Australia, weather- and climate-related events cause around 87% of
economic damage due to natural disasters (storms, floods, cyclones,earthquakes, fires, and landslides; BTE, 2001). In New Zealand, floods
and droughts are the most costly climate disasters (Hennessy et al.,2007). Economic damage from extreme weather is projected to increaseand provide challenges for adaptation (Hennessy et al., 2007).
Observed and projected trends in temperature and precipitation
extremes for the region are extensively covered in Chapter 3 (e.g.,Tables 3-2 and 3-3). ENSO is a strong driver of climate variability in thisregion (see Section 3.4.2).
4.4.7.2. Temperature Extremes
During the Eastern Australian heat wave, in February 2004, temperaturesreached 48.5°C in western New South Wales. About two-thirds ofcontinental Australia recorded maximum temperatures over 39°C. Dueto heat-related stresses, the Queensland ambulance service recorded a53% increase in ambulance call-outs (Steffen et al., 2006). A week-longheat wave in Victoria in 2009 corresponded with a sharp increase indeaths in the state. For the week of the heat wave a total of 606 deathswere expected and there were a total of 980 deaths, representing a62% increase (DHS, 2009).
An increase in heat-related deaths is projected given a warming climate
(Hennessy et al., 2007). In Australian temperate cities, the number ofdeaths is projected to more than double in 2020 from 1,115 per year atpresent and to increase to between 4,300 and 6,300 per year by 2050for all emission scenarios, including demographic change (McMichael etal., 2003b). In Auckland and Christchurch, a total of 14 heat-related deathsoccur per year in people aged over 65, but this number is projected torise approximately two-, three-, and six-fold for warming of 1, 2, and 3°C,respectively (McMichael et al., 2003b). An aging society in Australia andNew Zealand would amplify these figures. For example, it has beenprojected that, by 2100, the Australian annual death rate in people agedover 65 would increase from a 1999 baseline of 82 per 100,000 to arange of between 131 and 246 per 100,000 in 2100 for the scenariosexamined (SRES B2 and A2, with stabilization of atmospheric CO
2at
450 ppm; Woodruff et al., 2005). In Australia, cities with a temperateclimate are expected to experience more heat-related deaths than thosewith a tropical climate (McMichael et al., 2003b).
4.4.7.3. Droughts
There is a complex pattern of observed and projected changes in drynessover the region, with increasing dryness in some areas, and decreasingdryness or inconsistent signals in others (Tables 3-2 and 3-3). However,several high-impact drought events have been recorded (OCDESC,2007).
In Australia, the damages due to the droughts of 1982-1983, 1991-1995,
and 2002-2003 were US$ 2.3, 3.8, and 7.6 billion, respectively (Hennessyet al., 2007). Droughts have a negative impact on water security in theChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems261Murray-Darling Basin in Australia, as it accounts for most of the water
for irrigated crops and pastures in the country.
New Zealand has a high level of economic dependence on agriculture,
and drought can cause significant disruption for this industry. The1997-1998 El Niño resulted in severe drought conditions across large areasof New Zealand with losses estimated at NZ$ 750 million (2006 values)or 0.9% of GDP (OCDESC, 2007). Severe drought in two consecutivesummers, 2007-2009, affected a large area of New Zealand and causedon-farm net income to drop by NZ$ 1.9 billion (Butcher and Ford, 2009).Drought conditions also have a serious impact on electricity production inNew Zealand where around two-thirds of supply is from hydroelectricityand low precipitation periods result in increased use of fossil fuel forelectricity generation, a maladaptation to climate change. Auckland,New Zealand’s largest city, suffered from significant water shortages inthe early 1990s, but has since established a pipeline to the WaikatoRiver to guarantee supply (OCDESC, 2007).
Climate change may cause land use change in southern Australia.
Cropping could become non-viable at the dry margins if rainfallsubstantially decreases, even though yield increases from elevated CO
2
partly offset this effect (Luo et al., 2003).
4.4.7.4. Wildfire
Wildfires around Canberra in January 2003 caused AUS$ 400 milliondamage (Lavorel and Steffen, 2004), with about 500 houses destroyed,four people killed, and hundreds injured. Three of the city’s four waterstorage reservoirs were contaminated for several months by sediment-laden runoff (Hennessy et al., 2007). The 2009 fire in the state of Victoriacaused immense damage (see Box 4-1 and Case Study 9.2.2).
An increase in fire danger in Australia is associated with a reduced
interval between fire events, increased fire intensity, a decrease in fireextinguishments, and faster fire spread (Hennessy et al., 2007). Insoutheast Australia, the frequency of very high and extreme fire dangerdays is expected to rise 15 to 70% by 2050 (Hennessy et al., 2006). Bythe 2080s, the number of days with very high and extreme fire dangerare projected to increase by 10 to 50% in eastern areas of New Zealand,the Bay of Plenty, Wellington, and Nelson regions (Pearce et al., 2005),
with even higher increases (up to 60%) in some western areas. In both
Australia and New Zealand, the fire season length is expected to be
extended, with the window of opportunity for fuel reduction burning
shifting toward winter (Hennessy et al., 2007).
4.4.7.5. Intense Precipitation and Floods
There has been a likely decrease in heavy precipitation in many parts of
southern Australia and New Zealand (Table 3-2), while there is generallylow tomedium confidence in projections due to a lack of consistency
between models (Table 3-3).Floods are New Zealand’s most frequently experienced hazard (OCDESC,
2007) affecting both agricultural and urban areas. Being long and narrow,New Zealand is characterized by small river catchments and accordinglyshorter time-to-peak and shorter flood warning times, posing a difficultpreparedness challenge. Projected increases in heavy precipitationevents across most parts of New Zealand (Table 3-3) is expected to
cause greater erosion of land surfaces, more landslides, and a decreasein the protection afforded by levees (Hennessy et al., 2007). 
4.4.7.6. Storm Surges
Over 80% of the Australian population lives in the coastal zone, andoutside of the major capital cities is also where the largest population
growth occurs (Harvey and Caton, 2003; ABS, 2010). Over 500,000addresses are within 3 km of the coast and less than 5 m above sea
level (Chen and McAneney, 2006). As a result of being so close to sealevel, the risk of inundation from sea level rise and large storm surges
increases with climate change (Hennessy et al., 2007). The risk of a1-in-100 year storm surge in Cairns is expected to more than double by2050 (McInnes et al., 2003). Projected changes in coastal hazards fromsea level rise and storm surge are also an issue for New Zealand (e.g.,Ministry for the Environment, 2008). 
4.4.8. Open Oceans
The ocean’s huge mass in comparison to the atmosphere gives it a crucialrole in global heat budgets and chemical budgets. Possible extremeimpacts can be triggered by (1) warming of the surface ocean, with amajor cascade of physical effects, (2) ocean acidification induced byincreases in atmospheric CO
2, and (3) reduction in oxygen concentration
in the ocean due to a temperature-driven change in gas solubility andphysical impacts from (1). All have potentially nonlinear multiplicativeimpacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function, and each may increasethe vulnerability of ocean systems, triggering an extreme impact(Kaplan et al., 2010; Griffith et al., 2011). Surface warming of the oceanscan itself directly impact biodiversity by slowing or preventing growth intemperature-sensitive species. One of the most well-known biologicalimpacts of warming is coral bleaching, but ocean acidification can alsoaffect coral growth rates (Bongaerts et al., 2010). The seasonal sea icecycle affects biological habitats. Such species of Arctic mammals aspolar bears, seals, and walruses depend on sea ice for habitat, hunting,feeding, and breeding. Declining sea ice can decrease polar bear numbers(Stirling and Parkinson, 2006). 
4.4.9. Polar Regions
4.4.9.1. Introduction
The polar regions consist of the Arctic and the Antarctic, including
associated water bodies. The Arctic region consists of a vast treelessChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems262permafrost territory (parts of northern Europe, northern Asia, and North
America, and several islands including Greenland). Delimitation of theArctic may differ according to different disciplinary and political definitions(ACIA, 2004). Population density in the polar regions is low, so thatimpacts of climate change and extremes on humans may not be asnoticeable as elsewhere throughout the world. The territory of theRussian Arctic is more populated than other polar regions, henceimpacts of climate change are most noticeable there as they affecthuman activities. Specific impacts of climate extremes on the naturalphysical environment in polar regions are discussed in Section 3.5.7.
4.4.9.2. Warming Cryosphere
Polar regions have experienced significant warming in recent decades.Warming has been most pronounced across the Arctic Ocean Basin andalong the Antarctic Peninsula, with significant decreases in the extentand seasonal duration of sea ice, while in contrast, temperatures overmainland Antarctica have not warmed over recent decades (Lemke etal., 2007; Trenberth et al., 2007). Sea ice serves as primary habitat formarine organisms central to the food webs of these regions. Changesin the timing and extent of sea ice can impose temporal and spatialmismatches between energy requirements and food availability formany higher trophic levels, leading to decreased reproductive success,lower abundances, and changes in distribution (Moline et al., 2008). 
Warming in the Arctic may be leading to a shift of vegetation zones
(e.g., Sturm et al., 2001; Tape et al., 2006; Truong et al., 2006), bringingwide-ranging impacts and changes in species diversity and distribution.
In the Russian North, the seasonal soil thawing depth has increased
overall over the past four decades (Sherstyukov, 2009). As frozenground thaws, many existing buildings, roads, pipelines, airports, andindustrial facilities are destabilized. In the 1990s, the number ofdamaged buildings increased by 42 to 90% in comparison with the1980s in the north of western Siberia (Anisimov and Belolutskaya,2002; Anisimov and Lavrov, 2004). Arctic infrastructure faces increasedrisks of damage due to changes in the cryosphere, particularly the loss
of permafrost and land-fast sea ice (SWIPA, 2011).
An apartment building collapsed in the upper part of the Kolyma River
Basin, and over 300 buildings were severely damaged in Yakutsk as aresult of retreating permafrost (Anisimov and Belolutskaya, 2002;
Anisimov and Lavrov, 2004). Changes in permafrost damage thefoundations of buildings and disrupt the operation of vital infrastructure
in human settlements (Anisimov et al., 2004; see also Case Study 9.2.10).
Transport options and access to resources are altered by differences in
the distribution and seasonal occurrence of snow, water, ice, andpermafrost in the Arctic. This affects both daily living and commercial
activities (SWIPA, 2011).
In conditions of land impassability, frozen rivers are often used as
transport ways. In the conditions of climate warming, rivers freeze laterand melt earlier than before, and the duration of operation of transport
routes to the far north of Russia decreases with the increase in airtemperature in winter and spring (Mirvis, 1999).
Ice cover does not allow ship navigation. Navigation in the Arctic Ocean
is only possible during the ice-free period off the northern coasts ofEurasia and North America. During periods of low ice concentration,ships navigate toward ice-free passages, away from multi-year ice that hasaccumulated over several years. Regional warming provides favorableconditions for sea transport going through the Northern Sea Routealong the Eurasian coasts and through the Northwest Passage in thenorth of Canada and Alaska (ACIA, 2004).
In September 2007, when the Arctic Sea ice area was extremely low, the
Northwest Passage was opened up. In Russia, this enabled service toports of the Arctic region and remote northern regions (import of fuel,equipment, food, timber, and export of timber, oil, and gas). However,owing to deglaciation in Greenland, New Land, and Northern Land, thenumber of icebergs may increase, creating navigation hazards(Roshydromet, 2005, 2008; Rignot et al., 2010, Straneo et al., 2010). 
4.4.9.3. Floods
From the mid-1960s to the beginning of the 1990s, winter runoff in thethree largest rivers of Siberia (Yenisei, Lena, and Ob; jointly contributingapproximately 70% of the global river runoff to the Arctic Ocean)increased by 165 km
3(Savelieva et al., 2004).
Rivers in Arctic Russia experience floods, but their frequency, stage, and
incidence are different across the region, depending on flood formationconditions. Floods on the Siberian rivers can be produced by a highpeak of the spring flood, by rare heavy rain, or by a combination ofsnow and rain, as well as by ice jams, hanging dams, and combinationsof factors (Semyonov and Korshunov, 2006). 
Maximum river discharge was found to decrease from the mid-20th
century through 1980 in Western Siberia and the Far East (except forthe Yenisei and the Lena rivers). However, since 1980, maximumstreamflow values began to increase over much of Russia (Semyonovand Korshunov, 2006).
Snowmelt and rain continue to be the most frequent cause of hazardous
floods on the rivers in the Russian Arctic (85% of all hazardous floodsin the past 15 years). Hazardous floods produced by ice jams and windtides make up 10 and 5% of the total number of hazardous floods,respectively. For the early 21st century, Pomeranets (2005) suggeststhat the probability of catastrophic wind tide-related floods and icejam-related floods increased. The damage from floods depends not onlyon their level, but also on the duration of exposure. On average, a floodlasts 5 to 10 days, but sometimes high water marks have been recordedto persist longer, for example, for 20 days or more (Semyonov andKorshunov, 2006). Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems2634.4.9.4. Coastal Erosion
Coastal erosion is a significant problem in the Arctic, where coastlines
are highly variable due to environmental forcing (wind, waves, sea levelchanges, sea ice, etc.), geology, permafrost, and other elements(Rachold et al., 2005). For example, the amount of coastal erosion along
a 60 km stretch of Alaska’s Beaufort Sea doubled between 2002 and
2007. Jones et al. (2009) considered contributing factors to be meltingsea ice, increasing summer sea surface temperature, sea level rise, andincreases in storm power and associated stronger ocean waves.
Increasing coastal retreat will have further ramifications for Arctic
landscapes, including losses in freshwater and terrestrial wildlife habitats,in subsistence grounds for local communities, and in disappearingcultural sites, as well as adverse impacts on coastal villages and towns.In addition, oil test wells may be impacted (Jones et al., 2009). Coastalerosion has also become a problem for residents of Inupiat and on theisland of Sarichev (Russian Federation) (Revich, 2008). 
Permafrost degradation along the coast of the Kara Sea may lead to
intensified coastal erosion, driving the coastline back by up to 2 to 4 mper year (Anisimov and Belolutskaya, 2002; Anisimov and Lavrov, 2004).Coastline retreat poses considerable risks for coastal population centersin Yamal and Taymyr and other littoral lowland areas.
4.4.10. Small Island States
Small Island States (SIS) in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans havebeen identified as being among the most vulnerable to climate changeand climate extremes (e.g., UNFCCC, 1992; DSD, 1994; UNISDR, 2005).In the light of current experience and model-based projections, SIS, withhigh vulnerability and low adaptive capacity, have substantial futurerisks (Mimura et al., 2007). Smallness renders island countries at risk ofhigh proportionate losses when impacted by a climate extreme (Pellingand Uitto, 2001; see also Case Study 9.2.9 and Box 3-4).
Sea level rise could lead to a reduction in island size (FitzGerald et al.,
2008). Island infrastructure, including international airports, roads, and
capital cities, tends to predominate in coastal locations (Hess et al.,2008). Sea level rise exacerbates inundation, erosion, and other coastal
hazards; threatens vital infrastructure, settlements, and facilities; andthus compromises the socioeconomic well-being of island communities
and states (Hess et al., 2008). 
In 2005, regionally averaged temperatures were the warmest in the
western Caribbean for more than 150 years (Eakin et al., 2010). Theseextreme temperatures caused the most severe coral bleaching everrecorded in the Caribbean: more than 80% of the corals surveyed werebleached, and at many sites more than 40% died. Recovery from suchlarge-scale coral mortality is influenced by the extent to which coral
reef health has been compromised and the frequency and severity of
subsequent stresses to the system.Since the early 1950s, when the quality of disaster monitoring and
reporting improved in the Pacific Islands region, there has been ageneral increasing trend in the number of disasters reported annually(Hay and Mimura, 2010).
Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICs) exhibit a variety of
characteristics rendering generalization difficult (see Table 4-2;Campbell, 2006). One form of PICs is large inter-plate boundary islandsformed by subduction and found in the southwest Pacific Ocean. These
may be compared to the Oceanic (or intra-plate) islands which were, orare being, formed over ‘hot spots’ in the Earth’s mantle into volcanic
high islands. Some of these are still being formed and some are heavilyeroded with steep slopes and barrier reefs. Another form of PICs isatolls that consist of coral built on submerging former volcanic highislands, through raised limestone islands (former atolls stranded abovecontemporary sea levels). Each island type has specific characteristics inrelation to disaster risk reduction, with atolls being particularly vulnerableto tropical cyclones, where storm surges can completely inundate themand there is no high ground to which people may escape. In contrast,the inter-plate islands are characterized by large river systems and fertileflood plains in addition to deltas, both of which tend to be heavilypopulated. Fatalities in many of the worst weather- and climate-relateddisasters in the region have been mostly from river flooding (AusAID,2005). Raised atolls are often saved from the storm surge effects of

•Orographic rainfall These islands are located in the western 
Paciﬁc. River ﬂooding is more likely to be a

settlements are on the coast and exposed to 
storm damage.

Freshwater problems may lead to health 
problems.   Table 4-2 | Pacific Island type and exposure to climate extremes. Adapted from
Campbell, 2006.264tropical cyclones, but during Cyclone Heta that struck Niue in 2004, the
cliffs were unable to provide protection.
Drought is a hazard of considerable importance in SIS. In particular,
atolls have very limited water resources, being dependent on theirfreshwater lens, whose thickness decreases with sea level rise (e.g.,Kundzewicz et al., 2007), floating above sea water in the pervious coral,and is replenished by convectional rainfall. During drought events,water shortages in SIS become acute on atolls in particular, resulting inrationing in some cases (Campbell, 2006).
The main impacts from climatic extremes in PICs are damage to
structures, infrastructure, and crops during tropical cyclones and cropdamage and water supply shortages during drought events. On atolls,salinization of the freshwater lens and garden areas is a serious problemfollowing storm surges, high wave events, and ‘king’ tides (Campbell,2006). 
4.5. Costs of Climate Extremes and Disasters
The following section focuses on the economic costs imposed by climateextremes and disasters on humans, societies, and ecosystems and the costsof adapting to the impacts. Cost estimates are composed of observedand projected economic impacts, including economic losses, futuretrends in extreme events and disasters in key regions, and the costs ofadaptation. The section stands at the interface between chapters, usingthe conceptual framework of Chapters 1 and 2 and the scientificfoundation of Chapter 3 and earlier subsections in this chapter, andleading into the following Chapters 5 through 9.
4.5.1. Framing the Costs of Extremes and Disasters
The economic costs associated with climate extremes and disasters can besubdivided into impact or damage costs (or simply losses) and adaptationcosts. Costs arise due to economic, social, and environmental impacts ofa climate extreme or disaster and adaptation to those impacts in key
sectors. Residual damage costs are the impact and damage costs afterall desirable and practical adaptation actions have been implemented.Conceptually, comparing costs of adaptation with damages beforeadaptation and residual damages can help in assessing the economicefficiency of adaptation (Parry et al., 2009).
The impact of climate extremes and disasters on economies, societies,
and ecosystems can be measured as the damage costs and losses of
economic assets or stocks, as well as consequential indirect effects on
economic flows, such as on GDP or consumption. In line with generaldefinitions in Chapters 1 and 2, economic disaster riskmay be defined
as a probability distribution indicating potential economic damage costs
and associated return periods. The cost categories of direct, indirect, andintangible are rarely fully exclusive, and items or activities can have
elements in all categories.Direct damage costs or losses are often defined as those that are a
direct consequence of the weather or climate event (e.g., floods,windstorms, or droughts). They 
refer to the costing of the physical
impacts of climate extremes and disasters – on the lives and health of
directly affected persons; on all types of tangible assets, including
private dwellings, and agricultural, commercial, and industrial stocks andfacilities; on infrastructure (e.g., transport facilities such as roads, bridges,and ports, energy and water supply lines, and telecommunications); onpublic facilities (e.g., hospitals, schools); and on natural resources(ECLAC, 2003; World Bank, 2010). 
Indirect impact costs generally arise due to the disruption of the flows
of goods and services (and therefore economic activity) because of adisaster, and are sometimes termed consequential or secondary impactsas the losses typically flow from the direct impact of a climate event(
ECLAC, 2003; World Bank, 2010). Indirect damages may be caused by
the direct damages to physical infrastructure or sources of livelihoods,or because reconstruction pulls resources away from production.Indirect damages include additional costs incurred from the need to usealternative and potentially inferior means of production and/or distributionof normal goods and services (
Cavallo and Noy, 2010). For example,
electricity transmission lines may be destroyed by wind, a direct impact,causing a key source of employment to cease operation, putting manypeople out of work, and in turn creating other problems that can beclassified as indirect impacts. These impacts can emerge later in theaffected location, as well as outside the directly affected location (Pellinget al., 2002; ECLAC, 2003; Cavallo and Noy, 2010). Indirect impactsinclude both negative and positive factors – for example, transportdisruption, mental illness or bereavement resulting from disaster shock,rehabilitation, health costs, and reconstruction and disaster-proofinvestment, which can include changes in employment in a disaster-hitarea (due to reconstruction and other recovery activity) or additionaldemand for goods produced outside of a disaster-affected area (ECLAC,2003; World Bank, 2010). As another example, long-running droughtscan induce indirect losses such as local economic decline, out-migration,famine, the partial collapse of irrigation areas, or loss of livelihoodsdependent on hydroelectricity or rain-fed agriculture. It is important tonote that impacts on the informal or undocumented economy may bevery important in some areas and sectors, but are generally not countedin reported estimates of losses. 
Many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and
ecosystem services, are difficult to measure as they are not normallygiven monetary values or bought and sold, and thus they are also poorlyreflected in estimates of losses. These items are often referred to asintangibles in contrast to tangibles such as tradable assets, structures,
and infrastructure (
Handmer et al., 2002; Pelling et al., 2002 ; Benson and
Clay, 2003; ECLAC, 2003; Cavallo and Noy, 2010; World Bank, 2010 ). 
Adaptation costs are those associated with adaptation and facilitation
in terms of planning (e.g., developing appropriate processes includingkey stakeholders), actual adaptation (e.g., risk prevention, preparedness,and risk financing), reactive adaptation (e.g., emergency disaster responses,Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems265rehabilitation, and reconstruction), and finally the implementation of
adaptation measures (including transition costs) (Smit et al., 2001; alsosee the Glossary). The benefits of adaptation can generally be assessedas the value of avoided impacts and damages as well as the co-benefitsgenerated by the implementation of adaptation measures (Smit et al.,2001). The value of all avoidable damage can be taken as the gross (ortheoretically maximum) benefit of adaptation and risk management,which may be feasible to adapt to but not necessarily economically efficient(Pearce et al., 1996; Tol, 2001; Parry et al., 2009). The adaptation deficit
is identified as the gap between current and optimal levels of adaptationto climate change (Burton and May, 2004). However, it is difficult toassess the optimal adaptation level due to the uncertainties inherent inclimate scenarios, the future patterns of exposure and vulnerability toclimate events, and debates over methodological issues such as discountrates. In addition, as social values and technologies change, what isconsidered avoidable also changes, adding additional uncertainty tofuture projections.
4.5.2 Extreme Events, Impacts, and Development
The relationship between socioeconomic development and disasters,including those triggered by climatic events, has been explored by anumber of researchers over the last few years using statisticaltechniques and numerical modeling approaches. It has been suggestedthat natural disasters exert adverse impacts on the pace and nature ofeconomic development (Benson and Clay, 1998, 2003; Kellenberg andMobarak, 2008). (The ‘poverty trap’ created by disasters is discussed inChapter 8.) A growing literature has emerged that identifies theseimportant adverse macroeconomic and developmental impacts of naturaldisasters (Cuny, 1983; Otero and Marti, 1995; Benson and Clay, 1998,2000, 2003, 2004; Charveriat, 2000; Crowards, 2000; ECLAC, 2003;Mechler, 2004; Raddatz, 2009; Noy, 2009; Okuyama and Sahin, 2009;Cavallo and Noy, 2010). Yet, confidence in the adverse economicimpacts of natural disasters is only medium , as, although the bulk of
studies identify negative effects of disasters on shorter-term economicgrowth (up to three years after an event), others find positive effects(Albala-Bertrand, 1993; Skidmore and Toya, 2002; Caselli and Malhotra,2004; see Section 4.2). Differences can be partly explained by the lackof a robust counterfactual in some studies (e.g., what would GDP have
been if a disaster had not occurred?), failure to account for the informal
sector, varying ways of accounting for insurance and aid flows, different
patterns of impacts resulting from, for example, earthquakes versus
floods, and the fact that national accounting does not record thedestruction of assets, but reports relief and reconstruction as additionsto GDP (World Bank and UN, 2010). In terms of longer-run economic
growth (beyond three years after events), there are mixed findings with
the exception of very severe disasters, which have been found to setback development (World Bank and UN, 2010).
In terms of the nexus between development and disaster vulnerability,
researchers argue that poorer developing countries and smallereconomies are more likely to suffer more from future disasters thandeveloped countries, especially in relation to extreme impacts
(Hallegatte et al., 2007; Heger et al., 2008; Hallegatte and Dumas, 2009;Loayza et al., 2009; Raddatz, 2009). In general, the observed or modeledrelationship between development and disaster impacts indicates thata wealthier country is better equipped to manage the consequences ofextreme events by reducing the risk of impacts and by managing theimpacts when they occur. This is due ( inter alia ) to higher income levels,
more governance capacity, higher levels of expertise, amassed climate-proof investments, and improved insurance systems that can act totransfer costs in space and time (Wildavsky, 1988; Albala-Bertrand,1993; Burton et al., 1993; Tol and Leek, 1999; Mechler, 2004;Rasmussen, 2004; Brooks et al., 2005; Kahn, 2005; Toya and Skidmore,2007; Raschky, 2008; Noy, 2009). While the countries with highestincome account for most of the total economic and insured losses fromdisasters (Swiss Re, 2010), in developing countries there are higherfatality rates and the impacts consume a greater proportion of GDP . Thisin turn imposes a greater burden on governments and individuals indeveloping countries. For example, during the period from 1970 to 2008over 95% of deaths from natural disasters occurred in developingcountries (Cavallo and Noy, 2010; CRED, 2010). From 1975 to 2007,Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)countries accounted for 71.2% of global total economic losses fromtropical cyclones, but only suffered 0.13% of estimated annual loss ofGDP (UNISDR, 2009).
There is general consensus that, as compared to developed countries,
developing countries are more economically vulnerable to climateextremes largely because: (i) developing countries have less resilienteconomies that depend more on natural capital and climate-sensitiveactivities (cropping, fishing, etc.; Parry et al., 2007); (ii) they are oftenpoorly prepared to deal with the climate variability and physical hazardsthey currently face (World Bank, 2000); (iii) more damages are causedby maladaptation due to the absence of financing, information, andtechniques in risk management, as well as weak governance systems;(iv) there is generally little consideration of climate-proof investment inregions with a fast-growing population and asset stocks (such as in coastalareas) (IPCC, 2001; Nicholls et al., 2008); (v) there is an adaptation deficit
resulting from the low level of economic development (World Bank,2007) and a lack of ability to transfer costs through insurance and fiscalmechanisms; and vi) they have large informal sectors. However, in somecases like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, United States, developedcountries also suffer severe disasters because of social vulnerability andinadequate disaster protection (Birch and Wachter, 2006; Cutter andFinch, 2008).
While some literature has found that the relationship between income
and some natural disaster consequences is nonlinear (Kellenberg andMobarak, 2008; Patt et al., 2010), much empirical evidence supports anegative relationship between the relative share of GDP and fatalities,with fatalities from hydrometeorological extreme events falling withrising level of income (Kahn, 2005; Toya and Skidmore, 2007; WorldBank and UN, 2010). Some emerging developing countries, such as China,India, and Thailand, are projected to face increased future exposure to
Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems266extremes, especially in highly urbanized areas, as a result of the rapid
urbanization and economic growth in those countries (Bouwer et al.,2007; Nicholls et al., 2008).
It should also be noted that in a small country, a disaster can directly
affect much of the country and therefore the magnitude of losses andrecovery demands can be extremely high relative to GDP and publicfinancial resources (Mechler, 2004). This is particularly the case in theevent of multiple and/or consecutive disasters in short periods. Forexample, in Fiji, consecutive natural disasters have resulted in reducednational GDP as well as decreased socioeconomic development ascaptured by the Human Development Index (HDI) (Lal, 2010). In Mexico,natural disasters resulted in the HDI regressing by approximately twoyears and in an increase in poverty levels (Rodriguez-Oreggia et al., 2010).Patt et al. (2010) indicated that vulnerability in the least-developedcountries will rise most quickly, which implies an urgent need forinternational assistance. 
Costs and impacts not only vary among developing and developed
countries, but also between and within countries, regions, local areas,sectors, systems, and individuals due to the heterogeneity of vulnerabilityand resilience (see Chapter 2). Some individuals, sectors, and systemswould be less affected, or may even benefit, while other individuals,sectors, and systems may suffer significant losses in the same event.In general, the poorest and those who are socially or economicallymarginalized will be the most at risk in terms of being exposed andvulnerable (Wisner et al., 2004). For example, women and children arefound to be more vulnerable to disasters in many countries, with largerdisasters having an especially unequal impact (Neumayer and Plümper,2007).
4.5.3. Methodologies for Evaluating Impact and
Adaptation Costs of Extreme Events and Disasters
4.5.3.1. Methods and Tools for Costing Impacts
Direct, tangible impacts are comparatively easy to measure, but costing
approaches are not necessarily standardized and assessments are often
incomplete, which can make aggregation and comparability across theliterature difficult. In some countries, flood impact assessment has long
been standardized, for example, in Britain and parts of the United States(e.g., Handmer et al., 2002). Intangible losses can generally be estimatedusing valuation techniques such as loss of life/morbidity (usually
estimated using value of statistical life benchmarks), replacement value,
benefits transfer, contingent evaluation, travel cost, hedonic pricing
methods, and so on (there is a vast literature on this subject, e.g.,
Handmer et al., 2002; Carson et al., 2003; Pagiola et al., 2004; Readyand Navrud, 2006; TEEB, 2009). Yet, assessing the intangible impacts ofextremes and disasters in the social, cultural, and environmental fields
is more difficult, and there is little agreement on methodologies (Albala-
Bertrand, 1993; Tol, 1995; Hall et al., 2003; Huigen and Jens, 2006;Schmidt et al., 2009). Studies and reports on the economic impacts of extremes, such as
insurance or post-disaster reports, have mostly focused on direct andtangible losses, such as on impacts on produced capital and economicactivity. Intangibles such as loss of life and impacts on the naturalenvironment are generally not considered using monetary metrics (Parryet al., 2009). Loss of life due to natural disasters, including futurechanges, is accounted for in some studies (e.g., BTE, 2001; Jonkman,2007; Jonkman et al., 2008; Maaskant et al., 2009). Estimates of impactsthat account for tangibles and intangibles are expected to be muchlarger than those that consider tangible impacts only (Handmer et al.,2002; Parry et al., 2009). Potential impacts include all direct, indirect,and intangible costs, including the losses from public goods and naturalcapital (in particular ecosystem services), as well as the longer-termeconomic impact of disasters. Indirect impacts and intangible impactscan outweigh those of direct impacts. There will therefore often be alarge gap between potential impacts and the estimates from studiesthat consider only direct impacts.
Indirect economic loss assessment methodologies exist but produce
uncertain and method-dependent results. Such assessments atnational, regional, and global levels fall into two categories: a ‘topdown’ approach that uses models of the whole economy understudy, and a bottom-up or partial equilibrium approach that identifiesand values changes in specific parts of an economy (van der Veen,2004). 
The top-down approach is grounded in macroeconomics under which the
economy is described as an ensemble of interacting economic sectors.Most studies have focused on impact assessment remodeling actualevents in the past and aim to estimate the various, often hidden follow-on impacts of disasters (e.g., Ellson et al., 1984; Yezer and Rubin, 1987;Guimaraes et al., 1993; West and Lenze, 1994; Brookshire et al., 1997;Hallegatte et al., 2007; Rose 2007). Existing macroeconomic or top-down approaches utilize a range of models such as the Input-Output,Social Accounting Matrix multiplier, Computable General Equilibriummodels, economic growth frameworks, and simultaneous-equationeconometric models. These models attempt to capture the impact of theextreme event as it is felt throughout the whole economy. Only a fewmodels have aimed at representing extremes in a risk-based frameworkin order to assess the potential impacts of events and their probabilitiesusing a stochastic approach, which is desirable given the fact that extremeevents are non-normally distributed and the tails of the distributionmatter (Freeman et al., 2002; Mechler, 2004; Hallegatte and Ghil, 2007;Hallegatte, 2008). 
The bottom-up approach, derived from microeconomics, scales up data
from sectors at the regional or local level to aggregate an assessmentof disaster costs and impacts (see van der Veen, 2004). The bottom-upapproach to disaster impact assessment attempts to evaluate the impactof an actual or potential disaster on consumers’ willingness to pay (orwillingness to accept). This approach values direct loss of or damage toproperty, as well as that of the interruption to the economy, impacts onhealth and well-being, and impacts on environmental amenity andChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems267ecosystem services. In short, it attempts to value the impact of the
disaster on society. 
Overall, measuring the many effects of disasters is problematic, prone to
both overestimation (for example, double counting) and underestimation(because it is difficult to value loss of life or damage to the environment).Both over- and underestimation can be issues in different parts of the sameimpact assessment, for example, ecological and quality of life impacts maybe ignored, while double counting occurs in the measurement of indirect
impacts. As discussed earlier in this section, most large-scale estimatesleave out significant areas of cost and are therefore underestimates.Biases also affect the accuracy of estimates; for example, the prospectof aid may create incentives to inflate losses. How disaster impacts areevaluated depends on numerous factors, such as the types of impactsbeing evaluated, the objective of the evaluation, the spatial and temporalscale under consideration, and importantly, the information, expertise,and data available. In practice, the great majority of post-disasterimpact assessments are undertaken pragmatically using whatever dataand expertise are available. Many studies utilize both partial and generalequilibrium analysis in an ‘integrated assessment’ that attempts to captureboth the bottom-up and the economy-wide impacts of disasters (Ciscar,2009; World Bank, 2010). 
4.5.3.2. Methods and Tools for Evaluating the Costs of Adaptation
Over the last few years, a wide range of methodologies using differentmetrics, time periods, and assumptions has been developed and appliedfor assessing adaptation costs and benefits. However, much of theliterature remains focused on gradual changes such as sea level rise andeffects on agriculture (IPCC, 2007). Extreme events are generallyrepresented in an ad hoc manner using add-on damage functions basedon averages of past impacts and contingent on gradual temperatureincrease (see comment in Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000). In a review ofexisting literature, Markandya and Watkiss (2009) identify the followingtypes of analyses: investment and financial flows; impact assessments(scenario-based assessments); vulnerability assessments; adaptationassessments; risk management assessments; economic integrated
assessment models; multi-criteria analysis; computable general
equilibrium models; cost-benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis;and portfolio/real options analysis.
Global and regional assessments of adaptation costs, the focus of this
section, have essentially used two approaches: (1) determining thepure financial costs , that is, outlays necessary for specific adaptation
interventions (known as investment and financial flow analyses ); and
(2) economic costs involving estimating the wider overall costs and
benefits to society and comparing this to mitigation, often using
Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). The IAM approach leads to a
broader estimate of costs (and benefits) over long time scales, butrequires detailed models of the economies under study (UNFCCC,2007). One way of measuring the costs of adaptation involves first
establishing a baseline development path (for a country or all countries)with no climate change, and then altering the baseline to take into
account the impacts of climate change (World Bank, 2010). Then thepotential effects of various adaptation strategies on development orgrowth can be examined. Adaptation cost estimates are based onvarious assumptions about the baseline scenario and the effectivenessof adaptation measures. The difference between these assumptionsmakes it very difficult to compare or aggregate results (Yohe et al.,1995, 1996; West et al., 2001).
An example illustrating methodological challenges comes from agriculture,
where estimates have been made using various assumptions about
adaptation behavior (Schneider et al., 2000). These assumptions aboutbehavior range from the farmers who do not react to observed changes inclimate conditions (especially in studies that use crop yield sensitivity toweather variability) (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007; Lobell et al., 2008;Schlenker and Lobell, 2010), to the introduction of selected adaptationmeasures within crop yield models (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994), to theassumption of ‘perfect’ adaptation – that is, farmers have complete or‘perfect’ knowledge and apply that knowledge in ways that ensureoutcomes align exactly with theoretical predictions (Kurukulasuriya andMendelsohn, 2008a,b; Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008). Realistic assessmentsfall between these extremes, and a realistic representation of futureadaptation patterns depends on the in-due-time detection of the climatechange signal (Schneider et al., 2000; Hallegatte, 2009); the inertia inadoption of new technologies (Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000); theexistence of price signals (Fankhauser et al., 1999); and assessments ofplausible behavior by farmers. 
Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is an established tool for determining the
economic efficiency of development interventions. CBA compares thecosts of conducting such projects with their benefits and calculates thenet benefits or economic efficiency (Benson and Twigg, 2004). Ideally CBAaccounts for all costs and benefits to society including environmentalimpacts, not just financial impacts on individual businesses. All costsand benefits are monetized so that tradeoffs can be compared with acommon measure. The fact that intangibles and other items that aredifficult to value are often left out is one of the major criticisms of theapproach (Gowdy, 2007). In the case of disaster risk reduction (DRR)and adaptation interventions, CBA weighs the costs of the DRR projectagainst the disaster damage costs avoided. While the benefits createdby development interventions are the additional benefits due to, forexample, improvements in physical or social infrastructure, in DRR thebenefits are mostly the avoided or reduced potential damages and losses(Smyth et al., 2004). The net benefit can be calculated in terms of netpresent value, the rate of return, or the benefit-cost ratio. OECDcountries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, as well asinternational financial institutions such as the World Bank, AsianDevelopment Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank, have usedCBA for evaluating disaster risk management (DRM) in the context ofdevelopment assistance (Venton and Venton, 2004; Ghesquiere et al.,2006) and use it routinely for assessing engineering DRM strategiesdomestically. CBA can be, and has been, applied at any level from theglobal to local (see Kramer, 1995; Benson and Twigg, 2004; Venton andChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems268Venton, 2004; UNFCCC, 2007; Mechler, 2008). Because the chance of
occurrence of a disaster event can be expressed as a probability, itfollows that the benefits of reducing the impact of that event can beexpressed in probabilistic terms. Costs and benefits should be calculatedby multiplying probability by consequences; this leads to risk estimatesthat account for hazard intensity and frequency, vulnerability, andexposure (Smyth et al., 2004; Ghesquiere et al., 2006).
National-level studies of adaptation effectiveness in the European
Union, the United Kingdom, Finland, and The Netherlands, as well as ina larger number of developing countries using the National AdaptationProgramme of Action approach, have been conducted or are underway(Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2005; DEFRA, 2006; Lemmen et al.,2008; de Bruin et al., 2009; Parry et al., 2009). Yet the evidence base onthe economic aspects including economic efficiency of adaptationremains limited and fragmented (Adger et al., 2007; Moench et al.,2007; Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008; Parry et al., 2009). As noted atthe start of Section 4.5.3.2, many adaptation studies focus on gradualchange, especially for agriculture. Those studies considering extremeevents, and finding or reporting net benefits over a number of keyoptions (Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008; Parry et al., 2009), do so bytreating extreme events similarly to gradual onset phenomena andusing deterministic impact metrics, which is problematic for disasterrisk. A recent, risk-focused study (ECA, 2009) concentrating on nationaland sub-national levels went so far as to suggest an adaptation costcurve, which organizes relevant adaptation options around their cost-benefit ratios. However, given available data including future projectionsof risk and the effectiveness of options, this is probably at most heuristicrather than a basis for policy.
There are several complexities and uncertainties inherent in the estimates
required for a CBA of DRR. As these are compounded by climate change,CBA’s utility in evaluating adaptation may be reduced. These includedifficulties in handling intangibles and, as is particularly important forextremes, in the discounting of future impacts; CBA does not accountfor the distribution of costs and benefits or the associated equity issues.Moench et al. (2007) argue that CBA is most useful as a decision supporttool that helps the policymaker categorize, organize, assess, and presentinformation on the costs and benefits of a potential project, rather than
give a definite answer. Overall, the applicability of rigorous CBAs for
evaluations of adaptation is thus limited based on limited evidence and
medium agreement . 
4.5.3.3. Attribution of Impacts to Climate Change:
Observations and Limitations
Attribution of the impacts of climate change can be defined and used in a
way that parallels the well-developed applications for the physical climatesystem (IPCC, 2010). Detection is the process of demonstrating that a
system affected by climate has changed in some defined statisticalsense, without providing a reason for that change. Attribution is
the process of establishing the most probable causes, natural oranthropogenic, for the detected change with some defined level of
confidence. 
The IPCC Working Group II Fourth Assessment Report found, with very
high confidence , that observational evidence shows that biological
systems on all continents and in most oceans are already being affectedby recent climate changes, particularly regional temperature increases(Rosenzweig et al., 2007).
Attribution of changes in individual weather and climate events to
anthropogenic forcing is complicated because any such event mighthave occurred by chance in an unmodified climate as a result of natural
climate variability (see FAQ 3.2). An approach that addresses this problem
is to look at the likelihood of such an event occurring, rather than theoccurrence of the event itself (Stone and Allen, 2005). For example,human-induced changes in mean temperature have been shown toincrease the likelihood of extreme heat waves (Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004;Stott et al., 2004). For a large region of continental Europe, Stott et al.(2004) showed that anthropogenic climate change very likely doubled
the probability of surpassing a mean summer temperature not exceededsince advent of the instrumental record in 1851, but which was by the2003 event in Europe. More recent work provides further support for
such a linkage (Barriopedro et al., 2011; see Section 3.3.1). 
Most published studies on the attribution of impacts of extremes to
natural and anthropogenic climate change have focused on long-termrecords of disaster losses, or examine the likelihood of the event occurring.Most published effort has gone into the analysis of long-term disasterloss records.
There is high confidence , based on high agreement and medium
evidence , that economic losses from weather- and climate-related
disasters have increased (Cutter and Emrich, 2005; Peduzzi et al., 2009,2011; UNISDR, 2009; Mechler and Kundzewicz, 2010; Swiss Re 2010;Munich Re, 2011). A key question concerns whether trends in suchlosses, or losses from specific events, can be attributed to climatechange. In this context, changes in losses over time need to becontrolled for exposure and vulnerability. Most studies of long-termdisaster loss records attribute these increases in losses to increasingexposure of people and assets in at-risk areas (Miller et al., 2008;Bouwer, 2011), and to underlying societal trends – demographic,economic, political, and social – that shape vulnerability to impacts(Pielke Jr. et al., 2005; Bouwer et al., 2007). Some authors suggest thata (natural or anthropogenic) climate change signal can be found in therecords of disaster losses (e.g., Mills, 2005; Höppe and Grimm, 2009),but their work is in the nature of reviews and commentary rather thanempirical research. Attempts have been made to normalize loss recordsfor changes in exposure and wealth. There is medium evidence and high
agreement that long-term trends in normalized losses have not been
attributed to natural or anthropogenic climate change (Choi and Fisher,2003; Crompton and McAneney, 2008; Miller et al., 2008; Neumayerand Barthel, 2011). The evidence is medium because of the issues set
out toward the end of this section.Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems269The statement about the absence of trends in impacts attributable
to natural or anthropogenic climate change holds for tropical andextratropical storms and tornados (Boruff et al., 2003; Pielke Jr. et al.,2003, 2008; Raghavan and Rajesh, 2003; Miller et al 2008; Schmidt et al.,2009; Zhang et al., 2009;  see also Box 4-2) . Most stud ies related increases
found in normalized hurricane losses in the United States since the
1970s (Miller et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2009; Nordhaus, 2010) to thenatural variability observed since that time (Miller et al ., 2008;  Pielke Jr. et
al., 2008). Bouwer and Botzen (2011) demonstrated that other normalized
records of total economic and insured losses for the same series ofhurricanes exhibit no significant trends in losses since 1900. 
The absence of an attributable climate change signal in losses also holds
for flood losses (Pielke Jr. and Downton, 2000; Downton et al., 2005;Barredo, 2009; Hilker et al., 2009), although some studies did find recentincreases in flood losses related in part to changes in intense rainfallevents (Fengqing et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2009). For precipitation-related events (intense rainfall, hail, and flash floods), the picture ismore diverse. Some studies suggest an increase in damages related toa changing incidence in extreme precipitation (Changnon, 2001, 2009),although no trends were found for normalized losses from flash floodsand landslides in Switzerland (Hilker et al., 2009). Similarly, a study ofnormalized damages from bushfires in Australia also shows that increasesare due to increasing exposure and wealth (Crompton et al., 2010). 
Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major
cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather- andclimate-related disasters ( high confidence ). The attribution of economic
disaster losses is subject to a number of limitations in studies to date:data availability (most data are available for standard economic sectorsin developed countries); type of hazards studied (most studies focus oncyclones, where confidence in observed trends and attribution ofchanges to human influence is low; Section 3.4.4); and the processes
used to normalize loss data over time. Different studies use differentapproaches to normalization, and most normalization approaches takeaccount of changes in exposure of people and assets, but use only limited,if any, measures of vulnerability trends, which is questionable. Differentapproaches are also used to handle variations in the quality andcompleteness of data on impacts over time. Finding a trend or ‘signal’
in a system characterized by large variability or ‘noise’ is difficult andrequires lengthy records. These are all areas of potential weakness in
the methods and conclusions of longitudinal loss studies and more
empirical and conceptual efforts are needed. Nevertheless, the results of
the studies mentioned above are strengthened as they show similarresults, although they have applied different data sets and methodologies.
A general area of uncertainty in the studies concerns the impacts of
weather and climate events on the livelihoods and people of informal
settlements and economic sectors, especially in developing countries.
Some one billion people live in informal settlements (UNISDR, 2011),
and over half the economy in some developing countries is informal
(Schneider et al., 2010). These impacts have not been systematicallydocumented, with the result that they are largely excluded from bothlongitudinal impact analysis and attribution to defined weather
episodes. 
Another general area of uncertainty comes from confounding factors
that can be identified but are difficult to quantify, and relates to theusual assumption of constant vulnerability in studies of loss trends.These include factors that would be expected to increase resilience(Chapters 2 and 5 of this report) and thereby mask the influence ofclimate change, and those that could act to increase the impact ofclimate change. Those that could mask the effects of change includegradual improvements in warnings and emergency management (Adgeret al., 2005), building regulations (Crichton, 2007), and changinglifestyles (such as the use of air conditioning), and the almost instantmedia coverage of any major weather extreme that may help reducelosses. In the other direction are changes that may be increasing risk,such as the movement of people in many countries to coastal areasprone to cyclones (Pompe and Rinehart, 2008) and sea level rise. 
4.5.4. Assessment of Impact Costs
Much work has been conducted on the analysis of direct economic lossesfrom natural disasters. The examples mentioned below mainly focus onnational and regional economic losses from particular climate extremesand disasters, and also discuss uncertainty issues related to the assessmentof economic impacts. 
4.5.4.1. Estimates of Global and Regional Costs of Disasters
Observed trends in extreme impacts: Data on global weather- and
climate-related disaster losses reported since the 1960s reflect mainlymonetized direct damages to assets, and are unequally distributed.Estimates of annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few US$billion to above 200 billion (in 2010 dollars) for 2005 (the year ofHurricane Katrina) (UNISDR, 2009; Swiss Re 2010; Munich Re, 2011).These estimates do not include indirect and intangible losses. 
On a global scale, annual material damage from large weather and
climate events has been found to have increased eight-fold between the1960s and the 1990s, while the insured damage has been found to haveincreased by 17-fold in the same interval, in inflation-adjusted monetaryunits (Mechler and Kundzewicz, 2010). Between 1980 and 2004, thetotal costs of extreme weather events totaled US$ 1.4 trillion, of whichonly one-quarter was insured (Mills, 2005). Material damages caused bynatural disasters, mostly weather- and water-related, have increasedmore rapidly than population or economic growth, so that these factorsalone may not fully explain the observed increase in damage. The lossof life has been brought down considerably (Mills, 2005; UNISDR, 2011). 
Developing regions are vulnerable both because of exposure to
weather- and climate-related extremes and their status as developingeconomies. However, disaster impacts are unevenly distributed by type ofChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems270disaster, region, country, and the exposure and vulnerability of different
communities and sectors.
Percentage of direct economic losses by regions : The concentration of
information on disaster risk generally is skewed toward developedcountries and the Northern Hemisphere (World Bank and UN, 2010).Some global databases, however, do allow a regional breakdown ofdisaster impacts. The unequal distribution of the human impact of naturaldisasters is reflected in the number of disasters and losses across regions(Figure 4-7). In the period 2000 to 2008, Asia experienced the highestnumber of weather- and climate-related disasters. The Americas sufferedthe most economic loss, accounting for the highest proportion (54.6%)of total loss, followed by Asia (27.5%) and Europe (15.9%). Africaaccounted for only 0.6% of global economic losses, but economic damagesfrom natural disasters are underreported in these data compared toother regions (Vos et al., 2010). Although reporting biases exist, they arejudged to provide robust evidence of the regional distribution of the
number of disasters and of direct economic losses for this recent period2000 to 2008, and there is high agreement regarding this distribution
among different databases collected by independent organizations(Guha-Sapir et al., 2011; Munich Re, 2011; Swiss Re, 2011).
Damage losses in percentage of GDP by regions : The relative economic
burden in terms of direct loss expressed as a percentage of GDP has beensubstantially higher for developing states. Middle-income countrieswith rapidly expanding asset bases have borne the largest burden,
where during the period from 2001 to 2006 losses amounted to about1% of GDP , while this ratio has been about 0.3% of GDP for low-incomecountries and less than 0.1% of GDP for high-income countries, basedon limited evidence (Cummins and Mahul, 2009). In small exposed
countries, particularly small island developing states, these wealth lossesexpressed as a percentage of GDP and averaged over both disaster andnon-disaster years can be considerably higher, exceeding 1% in manycases and 8% in the most extreme cases over the period from 1970 to2010 (World Bank and UN, 2010), and individual events may consumemore than the annual GDP (McKenzie et al., 2005). This indicates a farhigher vulnerability of the economic infrastructure in developingcountries (Cavallo and Noy 2009; UNISDR, 2009). 
Increasing weather- and climate-related disasters: The number of reported
weather- and climate-related disasters and their direct financial costshave increased over the past decades. Figure 4-8 illustrates an increasingtrend (coupled with large interannual variability) in losses based ondata for large weather-and climate-related disasters over the period1980 to 2010, for which data have been gathered consistently andsystematically (see Neumayer and Barthel, 2011).
This increase in affected population and direct economic losses is also
coupled with the increasing numbers of reported weather- and climate-related disasters (UNISDR, 2009; Munich Re, 2011; Swiss Re 2011).

wildfire), meteorological (e.g., storm), and hydrological (e.g., flood, landslides) disasters is given for each region, along w ith damages (2009 US$ billion). Data from Vos et al., 2010.271These statistics imply the increasing cost of such disasters to society,
regardless of cause. It is also important to note that the number ofweather- and climate-related disasters has increased more rapidly thanlosses from non-weather disasters (Mills, 2005; Munich Re, 2011; SwissRe, 2011). This could indicate a change in climate extremes, but thereare other possible explanations (Bouwer, 2011). Drought and floodlosses may have grown due to a number of non-climatic factors, such asincreasing water withdrawals effectively exacerbating the impact ofdroughts, decrease in storage capacity in catchments (urbanization,deforestation, sealing surfaces, channelization) adversely affecting bothflood and drought preparedness, increase in runoff coefficients, andgrowing settlements in floodplains around urban areas (see Section4.2.2; Field et al., 2009). 
4.5.4.2. Potential Trends in Key Extreme Impacts
As indicated in Sections 3.3 to 3.5 and Tables 3-1 and 3-3, climateextremes may have different trends in the future; some such as heatwaves are projected to increase over most areas in length, frequency,and intensity, while projected changes in some other extremes are givenwith less confidence. However, uncertainty is a key aspect of disaster/climate change trend analysis due to attribution issues discussed above,incomparability of methods, changes in exposure and vulnerability over
time, and other non-climatic factors such as mitigation and adaptation.A challenge is ensuring that the projections of losses from futurechanges in extreme events are examined not for current populationsand economies, but for scenarios of possible future socioeconomicdevelopment. See Box 4-2 for a discussion of this with respect tocyclones.
It is more likely than not that the frequency of the most intense tropical
cyclones will increase substantially in some ocean basins (Section 3.4.4).Many studies have investigated impacts from tropical cyclones (e.g.,ABI, 2005a, 2009; Hallegatte, 2007; Pielke Jr., 2007; Narita et al., 2009;Bender et al., 2010; Nordhaus, 2010; Crompton et al., 2011). Table 4-3presents the projected percentage increase in direct economic losses fromtropical cyclones from a number of these studies, scaled to the year 2040
relative to a common baseline (year 2000). There is high confidence that
increases in exposure will result in higher direct economic losses fromtropical cyclones and that losses will also depend on future changes intropical cyclone frequency and intensity. One study, building on globalclimate model results from Bender et al. (2010), found that to attributeincreased losses to increased tropical cyclone activity in the UnitedStates with a high degree of certainty would take another 260 years ofrecords, due to the high natural variability of storms and their impactsChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems

Figure 4-8 | The overall losses and insured losses from weather- and climate-related disasters worldwide (in 2010 US$). These data for weath er- and climate-related ‘great’ and
‘devastating’ natural catastrophes are plotted without inclusion of losses from geophysical events. A catastrophe in this data set is considered ‘great’ if the number of fatalities
exceeds 2,000, the number of homeless exceeds 200,000, the country’s GDP is severely hit, and/or the country is dependent on in ternational aid. A catastrophe is considered
‘devastating’ if the number of fatalities exceeds 500 and/or the overall loss exceeds US$ 650 million (in 2010 values). Data fr om Munich Re, 2011.272(Crompton et al., 2011). See Section 4.5.3.3 on attribution and the use
of a risk-based approach to cope with this issue. Other studies haveinvestigated impacts from increases in the frequency and intensity ofextratropical cyclones at high latitudes (Dorland et al., 1999; ABI,2005a, 2009; Narita et al., 2010; Schwierz et al., 2010; Donat et al.,2011). In general there is medium confidence that increases in losses
due to extratropical cyclones will occur with climate change, withpossible decreases or no change in some areas. Projected increases
generally are slightly lower than increases in tropical cyclone losses (see
Table 4-3). Patt et al. (2010) projected future losses due to weather- andclimate-related extremes in least-developed countries.
Many studies have addressed future economic losses from river floods,
most of which are focused on Europe, including the United Kingdom
(Hall et al., 2003, 2005; ABI, 2009), Spain (Feyen et al., 2009), and TheNetherlands (Bouwer et al., 2010) (see Table 4-3). Maaskant et al.
(2009) is one of the few studies that addresses future loss of life from
flooding, and projects up to a four-fold increase in potential flood
victims in The Netherlands by the year 2040, when population growthis accounted for. Some studies are available on future coastal flood risks
(Hall et al., 2005; Mokrech et al., 2008; Nicholls et al., 2008; Dawson etal., 2009; Hallegatte et al., 2010). Although future flood losses in manylocations will increase in the absence of additional protection measures(high agreement, medium evidence ), the size of the estimated change is
highly variable, depending on location, climate scenarios used, andmethods used to assess impacts on river flow and flood occurrence (seeTable 4-3 for a comparison of some regional studies) (Bouwer, 2010).
Some studies have addressed economic losses from other types of
weather extremes, often smaller-scale compared to river floods andcyclones. These include hail damage, for which mixed results are found:McMaster (1999) and Niall and Walsh (2005) found no significanteffect on hailstorm losses for Australia, while Botzen et al. (2010) find asignificant increase (up to 200% by 2050) for damages in the agriculturalsector in The Netherlands, although the approaches used varyconsiderably. Rosenzweig et al. (2002) report on a possible doublingof losses to crops due to excess soil moisture caused by more intenserainfall.

Netherlands by mid-century.
It is well known that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather
and climate events are only one factor that affects risks, as changes inpopulation, exposure of people and assets, and vulnerability determineloss potentials (see Sections 4.2 to 4.4). Few studies have specificallyquantified these factors. However, the ones that do generally underlinethe important role of projected changes (increases) in population andcapital at risk. Some studies indicate that the expected changes inexposure are much larger than the effects of climate change (see Table4-3), which is particularly true for tropical and extratropical storms(Pielke Jr., 2007; Feyen et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2009). Other studiesshow that the effect of increasing exposure is about as large as the effectof climate change (Hall et al., 2003; Maaskant et al., 2009; Bouwer et al.,2010), or estimate that these are generally smaller (Dorland et al., 1999;Hoes, 2007). There is therefore medium confidence that, for some climate
extremes in many regions, the main driver for future increasing lossesin many regions will be socioeconomic in nature (based on medium
agreement and limited evidence ).Finally, many studies underline that
both factors need to be taken into account, as the factors do in factamplify each other, and therefore need to be studied jointly whenexpected losses from climate change are concerned (Hall et al., 2003;Bouwer et al., 2007, 2010; Pielke Jr., 2007; Feyen et al., 2009). 
4.5.5. Assessment of Adaptation Costs
The World Bank (2006) estimated the cost of climate-proofing foreigndirect investments, gross domestic investments, and Official DevelopmentAssistance, which was taken up and modified by Stern (2007), Oxfam(2007), and UNDP (2007). The second source of adaptation cost estimatesis UNFCCC (2007), which calculated the value of existing and plannedinvestment and financial flows required for the international communityto effectively and appropriately respond to climate change impacts. The
third source is World Bank (2010), which also conducted a number ofcountry-level studies to complement the global assessment, followingUNFCCC (2007), but aimed at improving upon this by assessing the
climate-proofing of existing and new infrastructure, using more precise
unit cost estimates and including the costs of maintenance as well as
those of port upgrading and the risks from sea level rise and storm
surges. Also, the investment in education necessary to neutralizeimpacts of extreme weather is calculated. Estimates of costs to adapt toclimate change (rather than simply to extremes and disasters), whichhave mostly been made for developing countries, exhibit a large rangeand relate to different assessment periods (such as today, 2015, or 2030).For 2030, the estimated global cost from UNFCCC (2007) ranges fromUS$ 48 to 171 billion per year for developed and developing countries,and US$ 28 to 67 billion per year for developing countries (in 2005dollars). Recent estimates from World Bank (2010) for developingcountries lead to higher projected costs and broadly amount to theaverage of this range with annual costs of up to US$ 100 billion (in2005 US$) (see Table 4-4). Confidence in individual global estimates islowbecause, as mentioned above and discussed by Parry et al. (2009),
the estimates are derived from only three relatively independent studies,which explains the seeming convergence of the estimates in latterstudies. As well, Parry et al. (2009) consider the estimates a significantunderestimation by at least a factor of two to three and possibly moreif the costs incurred by other sectors were included, such as ecosystemservices, energy, manufacturing, retailing, and tourism. The adaptationcost estimates are also based mostly on low levels of investment due toan existing adaptation deficit in many regions. Unavoidable residualdamages remain absent from these analyses.
In terms of regional costs and as reported in the World Bank (2010)
study, the largest absolute adaptation costs would arise in East Asia andthe Pacific, followed by the Latin American and Caribbean region as wellas sub-Saharan Africa. This pattern held for the two scenarios assessedChapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems

and one with the least precipitation (‘dry’) among all scenarios chosenfor the study, which employ socioeconomic driver information fromIPCC’s SRES A2 scenario (see Table 4-5).
Taking Africa as an example, based on various estimates the potential
additional costs of adaptation investment range from US$ 3 to 10 billionper year by 2030 (UNFCCC, 2007; PACJA, 2009). However, this could bealso an underestimate considering the desirability of improving Africa’sresilience to climate extremes as well as the flows of internationalhumanitarian aid in the aftermath of disasters. 
4.5.6. Uncertainty in Assessing the
Economic Costs of Extremes and Disasters
Upon reviewing the estimates to date, the costing of weather- and
climate-related disasters and estimating adaptation costs is stillpreliminary, incomplete, and subject to a number of assumptions withthe result that there is considerable uncertainty (Agrawala andFankhauser, 2008; Parry et al., 2009). This is largely due to modelinguncertainties in climate change and damage estimates, limited dataavailability, and methodological shortcomings in analyzing disasterdamage statistics. Such costing is further limited by the interactionbetween numerous adaptation options and assumptions about futureexposure and vulnerabilities, social preferences, and technology, as wellas levels of resilience in specific societies. Additionally the followingchallenges can be identified.
Risk assessment methods: Technical challenges remain in developing
robust risk assessment and damage costing methods. Study results canvary significantly between top-down and bottom-up approaches. Risk-based approaches are utilized for assessing and projecting disaster risk(Jones, 2004; Carter et al., 2007), for which input from both climate and
social scenarios is required. All climatic phenomena are subject to thelimitation that historically based relationships between damages and
disasters cannot be used with confidence to deduce future risk of
extreme events under changing characteristics of frequency and inten sity
(UNDP , 2004). Yet climate models are today challenged when reproducingspatially explicit climate extremes, due to coarse resolution and physicalunderstanding of the relevant process, as well as challenges in modelinglow-probability, high-impact events (see Section 3.2.3). Therefore,projections of future extreme event risk involve uncertainties that can
limit understanding of sudden onset risk, such as flood risk. Futuresocioeconomic development is also inherently uncertain. A uniform setof assumptions can help to provide a coherent global picture andcomparison and extrapolation between regions.
Data availability and consistency: Lack of data and robust information
increases the uncertainty of costing when scaling up to global levels froma very limited (and often very local) evidence base. There are double-counting problems and issues of incompatibility between types ofimpacts in the process of multi-sectoral and cross-scale analyses,especially for the efforts to add both market and non-market values (e.g.,ecosystem services) (Downton and Pielke Jr., 2005; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008;Parry et al., 2009). Moreover the full impacts of weather- and climate-related extremes in developing countries are not fully understood, anda lack of comprehensive studies on damage, adaptation, and residualcosts indicates that the full costs are underestimated. 
Information on future vulnerability: Apart from climate change,
vulnerability and exposure will also change over time, and theinteraction of these aspects should be considered (see, e.g., Hallegatte,2008; Hochrainer and Mechler, 2011). This has been recognized andassessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and risk arechanging in focus, leading to more integration across questions. Whileinitial studies focused on an analysis of the problem, the field proceededto assess potential impacts and risks, and now more recently started tocombine such assessments with the consideration of specific riskmanagement methods (Carter et al., 2007).
Some studies have suggested incorporating an analysis of the ongoing
or chronic economic impact of disasters into the adaptation planningprocess (Freeman, 2000). A fuller assessment of disaster cost at varyingspatial and temporal scales and costs related to impacts on human,social, built, and natural capital, and their associated services at differentlevels can set the stage for comparisons of post-disaster developmentstrategies. This would make disaster risk reduction planning andpreparedness investment more cost-effective (Gaddis et al., 2007). Forexample, there is consensus on the important role of ecosystems in riskreduction and well-being, which would make the value of ecosystemservices an integral part of key policy decisions associated with adaptation(Tallis and Kareiva, 2006; Costanza and Farley, 2007).Chapter 4 Changes in Impacts of Climate Extremes: Human Systems and Ecosystems

Table of Contents293Disasters are most acutely experienced at the local level ( high agreement, robust evidence ).The reality of
disasters in terms of loss of life and property occurs in local places and to local people. These localized impacts canthen cascade to have national and international consequences. In this chapter, local refers to a range of places, socialgroupings, experience, management, institutions, conditions, and sets of knowledge that exist at a sub-national scale.
[5.1]
Developing strategies for disaster risk management in the context of climate change requires a range of
approaches, informed by and customized to specific local circumstances ( high agreement, robust evidence ).
These differences and the context (national to global, urban to rural) in which they are situated shape localvulnerability and local impacts. [5.1]
The impacts of climate extremes and weather events may threaten human security at the local level ( high
agreement, medium evidence ). Vulnerability at the local level is attributed to social, political, and economic
conditions and drivers including localized environmental degradation and climate change. Addressing disaster risk andclimate extremes at the local level requires attention to much wider issues relating to sustainable development. [5.1]
While structural measures provide some protection from disasters, they may also create a false sense of
safety ( high agreement, robust evidence ). Such measures result in increased property development, heightened
population density, and more disaster exposure. Current regulations and design levels for structural measures may beinadequate under conditions of climate change. [5.3.2]
Sustainable land management is an effective disaster risk reduction tool ( high agreement, robust evidence ).
Land management includes land use, planning, zoning, conservation zones, buffer zones, or land acquisition. Often itis difficult for local jurisdictions to implement such measures as a result of political and economic pressures fordevelopment. However, such measures are often less disruptive to the environment and more sustainable at the locallevel than structural measures. [5.3.3]
Humanitarian relief is often required when disaster risk reduction measures are absent or inadequate
(high agreement, robust evidence ).Such assistance is more effective when it takes local social, cultural, and
economic conditions into account, acknowledges local agency in disaster response, and recognizes that the initialassistance during and immediately after disasters is nearly always locally generated. [5.2.1]
Post-disaster recovery and reconstruction provide an opportunity for reducing weather- and climate-related
disaster risk and for improving adaptive capacity ( high agreement, robust evidence ). An emphasis on rapidly
rebuilding houses, reconstructing infrastructure, and rehabilitating livelihoods often leads to recovering in ways that
recreate or even increase existing vulnerabilities, and that preclude longer-term planning and policy changes for
enhancing resilience and sustainable development. Including local actors benefits the recovery process. [5.2.3]
Disasters associated with climate extremes influence population mobility and relocation affecting host and
origin communities ( medium agreement, medium evidence ). Most people return and participate in the post-
disaster recovery in their local areas. If disasters occur more frequently and/or with greater magnitude, some local
areas will become increasingly marginal as places to live or in which to maintain livelihoods. In such cases, migration
and displacement could become permanent and could introduce new pressures in areas of relocation. For locations
such as atolls, in some cases it is possible that many residents will have to relocate. In other cases, migration is an
adaptation to climate change, with remittances supporting community members who remain at home. [5.2.2]
Integration of local knowledge with additional scientific and technical knowledge can improve disaster
risk reduction and climate change adaptation ( high agreement, robust evidence ). Local populations document
their experiences with the changing climate, particularly extreme weather events, in many different ways, and this typeChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Executive Summary294of self-generated knowledge induces discussions of proactive adaptation strategies and can uncover existing capacity
within the community and important current shortcomings. [5.4.4]
Effectively communicating risk involves multiple pathway exchanges between decisionmakers and local
citizens ( high agreement, medium evidence ). Viewing risk communication as a social process allows for effective
participatory approaches, relationship building, and the production of visual, compelling, and engaging information foruse by local stakeholders. [5.3.1]
Inequalities influence local coping and adaptive capacity and pose disaster risk management and adaptation
challenges ( high agreement, robust evidence ). These inequalities reflect differences in gender, age, wealth, class,
ethnicity, health, and disability. They may also be reflected in differences in access to livelihoods and entitlements.Understanding and increasing the awareness of coping mechanisms in the context of local-level livelihood is importantto climate change adaptation planning and risk management. This signifies the need for the identification andaccommodation of these differences to enhance opportunities arising from their incorporation into adaptation planningand disaster response. [5.5.1]
Ecosystem management and restoration activities that focus on addressing deteriorating environmental
conditions are essential to protecting and sustaining people’s livelihoods in the face of climate extremes(high agreement, robust evidence ). Such activities include, among others, watershed rehabilitation, agro-ecology,
and forest landscape restoration. Moreover, provision of better access to and control of resources will improve people’slivelihoods, and build long-term adaptive capacity. Such approaches have been recommended in the past, but havenot been incorporated into capacity building to date. [5.3.3]
Local-level institutions and self-organization are critical for social learning, innovations, and action; all are
essential elements for local risk management and adaptation ( high agreement, medium evidence ).Adaptive
capacities are not created in a vacuum – local institutions provide the enabling environment for community-basedadaptation planning and implementation. Local participation (community-based organizations, development committees)contributes to empowering the most vulnerable and strengthening innovations. Addressing political and cultural issuesat the local levels are fundamental to the development of any strategy aiming at sustained disaster risk managementand adaptation. [5.4]
The rapid urbanization of the sub-national populations and the growth of megacities, especially in
developing countries, have led to the emergence of highly vulnerable urban communities, particularlythrough informal settlements and inadequate land management, presenting challenges to disastermanagement ( high agreement, robust evidence ). Addressing these critical vulnerabilities means consideration of
the social, political, and economic driving forces, including rural-to-urban migration, changing livelihoods, and wealthinequalities as key inputs into decisionmaking. [5.5.1]
Effective local adaptation strategy requires addressing a number of factors that limit the ability of local
people to undertake necessary measures to protect themselves against climate extremes and disasters(high agreement, robust evidence ). Closing the information gap is critical to reducing vulnerability of natural-
resource dependent communities. Maintaining the ability of a community to ensure equitable access and entitlement
to key resources and assets is essential to building local adaptive capacity in a changing climate. Moreover, capacity
building and development of new skills for diversifying local livelihoods are key to flexibility in disaster reduction,
improving local adaptation, and managing disasters. [5.5]
Comprehensive assessments of local disaster risk are lacking in many places ( high agreement, medium
evidence ). As a foundation for management options, the methodology for locally based vulnerability assessments
(exposure and sensitivity) and potential costs needs more development and testing for applications to the local
context. [5.6]
Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism used at the local level ( medium agreement, medium evidence ). Risk
sharing (formal insurance, micro-insurance, crop insurance) can be a tool for risk reduction and for recovering livelihoodsChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level295after a disaster. Under certain conditions such tools can provide disincentives for reducing disaster risk at the local
level through the transfer of the risk spatially (to other places) or temporally (to the future). [5.6.3]
Local participation supports community-based adaptation to benefit management of disaster risk and
climate extremes ( medium agreement, medium evidence ).However, improvements in the availability of human
and financial capital and of disaster risk and climate information customized for local stakeholders can enhancecommunity-based adaptation. [5.6]
Data on natural disasters and disaster risk reduction are lacking at the local level, which can constrain
improvements in local vulnerability reduction ( high agreement, medium evidence ).This is the case in all areas
but especially so in developing countries. Local knowledge systems are often neglected in disaster risk management.There is considerable potential for adapting geographic information systems to include local-level knowledge to supportdisaster management activities. [5.7]
Disaster loss estimates are inconsistent and highly dependent on the scale of the analysis, and result in
wide variations among community, state, province, and sub-national regions ( high agreement, robust
evidence ). Indirect losses are increasingly taken into account as significant factors in precipitating negative economic
impacts. Adaptation costs, though hard to estimate, can be reduced if climate change adaptation is integrated intoexisting disaster risk management and disaster risk management is in turn embedded in development strategies anddecisionmaking. [5.5]
Mainstreaming disaster risk management into policies and practices provides key lessons that apply to
climate change adaptation at the local level ( high agreement, medium evidence ). Addressing social welfare,
quality of life, infrastructure, and livelihoods, and incorporating a multi-hazards approach into planning and action fordisasters in the short term, facilitates adaptation to climate extremes in the longer term. [5.4, 5.5, 5.6]
The main challenge for local adaptation to climate extremes is to apply a balanced portfolio of approaches
as a one-size-fits-all strategy may prove limiting for some places and stakeholders ( high confidence,
medium evidence ). Successful measures simultaneously address fundamental issues related to the enhancement of
local collective actions, and the creation of approaches at national and international scales that complement, support,and legitimize such local actions. [5.4, 5.6]Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level2965.1. Introduction: Why the Local is Important
Disasters occur first at the local level and affect local people. These
localized impacts can then cascade to have national and internationalramifications. As a result, the responsibility for managing such risksrequires the linkage of local, national, and global scales (Figure 5-1).
Some disaster risk management options are bottom-up strategies,
designed by and for local places, while other management options areproducts of global negotiations (Chapter 7) that are then implementedthrough national institutions (Chapter 6) to local levels. Institutions,actors, governance, and geographic units of analysis are not uniformacross these scales. Even within each scale there are differences. Whilesome communities are able to cope with disaster risks, others havelimited disaster resilience and capacity to cope with present disaster risklet alone adapt to climate variability and extremes. This is the topic ofthis chapter: to present evidence on where disasters are experienced,how disaster risks are managed at present, and the variability in copingmechanisms and capacity in the face of climate variability and change,all from the perspective of local places and local actors. The chapterexplores three themes: how disaster risks are managed at present; how theimpact of climate extremes threatens human security at the local level; andthe role of scale and context in shaping variability in vulnerability,coping, adaptive capacity, and the management of disaster risks andclimate extremes at the local level.The idea of local has many connotations. For the purposes of this report,
local refers to a range of places, management structures, institutions,social groupings, conditions, and sets of experiences and knowledgethat exist at a scale below the national level. As administrative units,local can range from villages, districts, suburbs, cities, and metropolitanareas, through to regions, states, and provinces. The conception of localincludes the set of institutions (public and private) that maintain andprotect local people as well as those that have some administrativecontrol over space and resources. In these places, choices and actionsfor disaster risk management and adaptation to climate extremes canbe initially independent of national interventions. At the local level thereis traditional knowledge about disaster risk and grassroots actions tomanage it. Functional or physical units such as watersheds, ecologicalzones, or economic regions operate at the local level, including theprivate and public institutions that govern their use and management.Each of the differing connotations of local means that there are differingapproaches to and contents of disaster risk management practice,differing stakeholders and interest groups, and more significantly,differing relations with the national and international levels (Adgeret al., 2005). We recognize that states and provinces in many countriesare large complex entities with similar powers as smaller nations.Where we discuss states and provinces and similar administrativestructures in this chapter, we refer to them as sub-national for clarificationpurposes.

Figure 5-1 | Linking local to global actors and responsibilities.297Local places vary in their disaster experience, who and what is at risk, the
potential geographical extent of the potential impact and responses,and in stakeholders and decisionmakers. Local places have considerableexperience with short-term coping responses and adjustments to disasterrisk (UNISDR, 2004), as well as with longer-term adjustments such asthe establishment of local flood defenses, the selection of droughtresistant crops, or seasonal or longer migration by one or more familymembers. For example, the use of remittances is a substantial source ofpost-disaster income and is regularly used as a means for diversifyinglivelihoods to enhance resilience and to proactively cope with extremes(Adger et al., 2002).
Climate-sensitive hazards such as flooding, tropical cyclones, drought,
heat, and wildfires regularly affect many localities with frequent, yetlow-level, losses (UNISDR, 2009). Because of their frequent occurrence,localities have developed extensive reactive disaster risk managementpractices. However, disaster risk management also entails the day-to-daystruggle to improve livelihoods, social services, and environmentalservices. Local response and long-term adaptation to climate extremes
will require disaster risk management that acknowledges the role of
climate variability. This can mean a modification and expansion of local
disaster risk management principles and experience through innovative
organizational, institutional, and governmental measures at all
jurisdictional levels (local, national, international). Institutionally-driven
arrangements may constrain or impede local actions and ultimatelylimit the coping capacity and adaptation of local places. 
Local communities routinely experience hazard impacts, with many
resulting from extreme weather and climate events (see Chapter 3). The
significance of discussing these from the local perspective is that extreme
weather and climate events will vary from place to place and not all
places have the same experience with that particular initiating event.
Research demonstrates that disaster experience influences proactivebehaviors in preparing for and responding to subsequent events (seeSection 5.4.1). In the context of climate change, some localities could be
experiencing certain types of hazards for the first time and not have theexisting capacities for preparedness and response. For example,Hurricane Catarina, the first South Atlantic hurricane that made landfallas a category 1 storm just north of Porto Alegre, Brazil, in March 2004(McTaggart-Cowan et al., 2006), was the region’s first local experiencewith a hurricane. However, there is low confidence in attribution of any
long-term increases in hurricane formation in this ocean region wheretropical cyclones had not been previously recorded (Table 3-2). Finally,not all of the extreme events become severe enough to cause a disasterof national or international magnitude, yet they will create ongoingproblems for local disaster risk management. 
The second theme of the chapter examines how climate extremes could
threaten the human security of local populations. Because these risksoften affect the basic functioning of society, it is increasingly recognizedthat climate change adaptation and disaster risk management shouldbe integral components of development planning and implementationto increase sustainability (Thomalla et al., 2006; see Box 5-1). In otherwords, both have to be mainstreamed into national development plans,poverty reduction strategies, sectoral policies, and other developmenttools and techniques (UNDP , 2007). For example, rural communities inmany world regions face greater risks of livelihood loss resulting fromflooding of low-lying coastal areas, water scarcity and drought, declinein agricultural yields and fisheries resources, and loss of biologicalresources (Osman-Elasha and Downing, 2007).  In some African countries
where recurrent floods are closely linked with El Niño-SouthernOscillation (ENSO) events (Ward et al., 2010), the result is majoreconomic and human loss seen in places such as Mozambique (Mirza,2003; Obasi, 2005) and Somalia. For such communities, with lessdeveloped infrastructure and health services, the impacts of floods areoften further exacerbated by health problems associated with waterscarcity and quality, such as malnutrition, diarrhea, cholera, and malaria(Kabat et al., 2002).Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Box 5-1 | Climate Change and Violent Conflict
Linking climate change and violent conflict is controversial. The conceptual debate links climate change to resource scarcity ( or those
essential resources to support livelihoods), which in turn leads to human insecurity. At the local scale, there are two distinc t outcomes:
armed conflict or migration, with the latter potentially leading to increased conflict in the receiving locality (Barnett and A dger, 2007;
Nordås and Gleditsch, 2007). For example, some research suggests that environmental stresses feed the tensions between localiti es as
they compete for land to support their livelihoods (Kates, 2000; Barnett, 2003; Osman-Elasha and El Sanjak, 2009). Extreme even ts such
as droughts and heat waves could increase these tensions in areas already facing situations of water scarcity and environmentaldegradation, giving rise to conflicts resulting in the dislocation of large numbers of refugees and people within and across bo rders.
However, there is limited agreement and evidence to support the link between climate change and violent conflict, especially in  Africa
(Burke et al., 2009; Buhaug, 2010). While the causal chain suggested in the literature (climate change increases the risk of vio lent conflict)
has found currency within the policy community, it has not been adequately substantiated in the scientific literature ( low agreement and
limited evidence ). Where empirical studies exist, they are methodologically flawed in a number of ways: not controlling for population
size; focusing only on conflict cases and not all migration instances; using aggregated, not disaggregated climate data at sub- national
scales; and having inherent inconsistencies in the time frames used (short-term variability in violent conflict; longer-term va riability in
climate). More research on the local climate-conflict nexus is warranted in order to determine if a causal linkage exists.298In order to develop preparedness measures for disaster risk management
and climate adaptation, the vast contextual differences of localitieswill have to be considered. They include differences in populationcharacteristics that influence vulnerability, differences in settlementpatterns ranging from urban to rural, differences in administrative unitsfrom municipalities to provincial governments, and differences withindeveloping and developed country contexts. Given the wide disparities,it is clear that single solutions for disaster risk management are notpossible. For example, there are differences between urban and ruralcommunities in terms of disaster and climate change vulnerability anddisaster risk and adaptation options. Given the rapid pace of urbanizationand diffusion of communication and transportation networks into distantareas, the sharp distinction between urban and rural is less visible inmany areas. In its place is a continuum with local places exhibitingboth rural and urban characteristics with a mix of vulnerabilities andjurisdictional issues that are neither totally urban nor rural (McGregoret al., 2006; Aragon-Durand, 2007).
Scalar considerations must also be emphasized in planning. Efforts to
forge greater and more equitable capacity at the local scale have to besupported by policies at the national level to increase the ability of localinstitutions and communities to cope with present and future risks fromclimate-sensitive hazards. To effectively reduce vulnerabilities to hazardsassociated with climate change, coordination across different levels andsectors is required, in addition to the involvement of a broad range ofstakeholders beginning at the local level (UNISDR, 2004; DFID, 2006;Tearfund., 2006; Devereux and Coll-Black, 2007; Davies, 2009). The largerglobal context within which a locality is situated affects outcomes. It ispossible that the history of resource exploitation, globalization, and theprocesses of development as currently practiced may be increasing, ratherthan reducing disaster vulnerability at the local level (see Chapter 2).Those choosing strategies for reducing disaster risk and adapting toclimate change, especially in developing countries, need to take theseprocesses into account (UNISDR, 2009).
These contextual factors are critical to planning for climate extremes.
They suggest the need for strengthening coordination between climatechange adaptation and disaster risk management locally that will in turnimprove the implementation of plans (Mitchell and van Aalst, 2008).Such coordination is also needed in order to avoid any negative impacts
across different sectors or scales that could potentially result from
fragmented adaptation and development plans. This is evident in theimplementation of some of the adaptation strategies, such as large-
scale agriculture, irrigation, and hydroelectric development, that maybenefit large groups or the national interests but may also harm local,indigenous, and poor populations (Kates, 2000; Rojas Blanco, 2006).Some sources believe that it is essential that any new disaster risk
reduction or climate change adaptation strategies must be built onstrengthening local actors and enhancing their livelihoods (Osman-Elasha,2006a). Moreover, a key aspect of planning for adaptation at the local
level is the identification of the differentiated social impacts of climate
change based on gender, age, disability, ethnicity, geographical location,livelihood, and migrant status (Tanner and Mitchell, 2008). Emphasisneeds to be given to identifying the adaptation measures that serve the
most vulnerable groups, address their urgent needs, and increase theirresilience. This often means using a more coordinated and integratedmanagement approach with the involvement of diverse stakeholdergroups (Sperling and Szekely, 2005), which may assist in avoidingmaladaptation across sectors or scales and provide for win-win solutions. 
5.2. How Local Places Currently Cope
with Disaster Risk
Local people everywhere have developed skills, knowledge, and
management systems that enable them to interact with their environment.Often these interactions are beneficial and provide the livelihoods thatpeople living in local places depend on. At the same time communitieshave developed ways of responding to disruptive environmental events.These coping mechanisms include measures that seek to modifythe impacts of disruptive events, modify some of the attributes orenvironmental aspects of the events themselves, and/or actions to shareor reduce the disaster risk burdens (Burton et al., 1993). By the sametoken, some actions taken at local levels (e.g., deforestation and coralmining) may also increase disaster risks. It is important to acknowledgethat while climate change may alter the magnitude and/or frequency ofsome climatic extremes (see Chapter 3), other environmental, social,political, or economic processes (many of them also global in scale) areaffecting the abilities of communities to cope with disaster risks andclimate-sensitive hazards (Wisner et al., 2004; Adger and Brown, 2009).Accordingly, disaster losses have increased significantly in recent decades(UNDP , 2004; UNISDR, 2004). These social, economic, and politicalprocesses are complex and deep seated and present major obstacles toreducing disaster risk, and may constrain efforts to reduce communityChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
FAQ 5.1 | Why is the local context important
in climate change adaptation anddisaster risk management?
In the context of this report, the local refers to a range of
places (community, city, province, region, state), managementstructures, institutions, social groupings, conditions, and setsof experiences and knowledge that exist at a scale below thenational level. It also includes the set of institutions (publicand private) that maintain and protect social relations as wellas those that have some administrative control over spaceand resources. The definition of the local influences the contextfor disaster risk management, the experience of disasters, andconditions, actions, and adaptation to climate changes. Localis important because locals respond and experience disastersat first hand, they retain local and traditional knowledgevaluable for disaster reduction and adaptation plans, andlastly they implement adaptation plans. 299vulnerabilities to extreme events under conditions of climate change. In
Section 5.2 we outline three common local-level coping strategies:emergency assistance and disaster relief, population movements, andrecovery and reconstruction. 
5.2.1. Emergency Assistance and Disaster Relief
Humanitarian assistance is often required when other measures toreduce disasters have been unsuccessful, and plays a critical role inhelping local people cope with the effects of disasters. Such relief oftenhelps to offset distress and suffering at the local level and to assist in
recovery and rehabilitation. Sometimes external relief is unnecessary or
inappropriate because the local people affected by disasters often are notcompletely helpless or passive and are capable of helping themselves(Cuny, 1983; De Ville de Groyet, 2000). This view is sustained bycommonplace definitions of disasters as situations where communitiesor even countries cannot cope without external assistance (Cuny, 1983;Quarantelli, 1998).
It is important to realize that the first actors providing assistance during
and after disasters are members of the affected community (De Ville deGroyet, 2000) who provide relief through local charities, kinship net works,
or local governments. In isolated communities such as those in the outerislands of small-island developing states, external assistance may besubject to considerable delay and self-help is an essential element ofresponse, especially in the period before assistance arrives. Typically,emergency assistance and disaster relief in developed countries comesin the form of assistance from national and state/provincial levelgovernments to local communities. The provision of international reliefis usually from members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operationand Development to developing countries (Development Initiatives,2009). The international provision of disaster relief to local places hasbecome highly sophisticated and much broader in scope over the past twodecades, involving both development and humanitarian organizations,with the increasing recognition that external relief providers make useof local knowledge in planning their relief efforts (Morgan, 1994; Darcyand Hofmann, 2003; Méheux et al., 2010). The relief itself includes such
things as assistance in post-disaster assessment, food provision, waterand sanitation, medical assistance and health services, household goods,temporary shelter, transport, tools and equipment, security, logistics,
communications, and community services (Bynander et al., 2005; Cahill,
2007). Many of these activities are organized into clusters of specialists
from multilateral organizations and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), among others, coordinated by the United Nations.
While much of the relief tends to be organized at more of a national and
international scale than local scale, the distribution and use of relief
occur at the local level. From this perspective it is vital to understandwhat is locally appropriate in terms of the type of relief provided, andhow it is distributed (Darcy and Hofmann, 2003; Kovác and Spens,2007). Similarly, local resources and capacities should be utilized asmuch as possible (Beamon and Balcik, 2008). There has also been atrend towards international humanitarian organizations working with
local partners, although on occasion this can result in the imposition ofexternal cultural values resulting in resentment or resistance (Hillhorst,2002). 
Relief, nevertheless, is often a critically important strategy for coping.
Relief organizations have built capacity based on experience in recentyears, have become increasingly accountable, and are obliged to followhumanitarian principles. Despite these improvements, some problemsremain. Relief cannot cover all losses, most of which are borne locally.Relief can undermine local coping capacities and reduce resilience andsustainability (Susman et al., 1983; Waddell, 1989), reinforce the statusquo that was characterized by vulnerability (O’Keefe et al., 1976), and insome cases, serve to remove independence or autonomy from disaster‘victims’ so that ownership of the event and control over the recoveryphase is lost at the local level (Hillhorst, 2002). Relief is ofteninequitably distributed and in some disasters there is insufficient relief.Corruption is also a factor in some disaster relief operations with localelites often benefiting more than others (Pelling and Dill, 2010).Humanitarian organizations are increasingly aware of these concernsand many are addressing them through coordination of activities,addressing gendered inequalities, and working in partnership with localorganizations in disaster relief. There is also a growing recognition ofthe need for accountability in humanitarian work (HumanitarianAccountability Partnership International, 2011).
Not all disasters engender the same response, as local communities
receive different levels of assistance. For example, those people mostaffected by a small event can suffer just as much as a globally publicizedbig event but are sometimes overlooked by relief agencies. Fast onsetand unusual disasters such as tsunamis generate considerably morepublic interest and contributions from governments, NGOs, and thepublic, sometimes referred to as the CNN factor (Olsen et al., 2003).Disasters that are overshadowed by other newsworthy or media events,such as coverage of major sporting events, are often characterized bylower levels of relief support (Eisensee and Stromberg, 2007). Wherethere is widespread media coverage, NGOs and governments are oftenpressured to respond quickly with the possibility of an oversupply ofrelief and personnel. This has worsened in recent times when reportersare ‘parachuted’ into disaster sites often in advance of relief teams butthey have little understanding of the contextual factors that oftenunderlie vulnerability to disasters (Silk, 2000). Such media coverageoften perpetrates disaster myths such as the prevalence of looting,helplessness, and social collapse, putting pressure on interveners toselect military options for relief when humanitarian assistance would bemore helpful (Tierney et al., 2006). 
Relief is politically more appealing than disaster risk management (Seck,
2007) and it often gains much greater political support and funding thanmeasures that would help offset the need for it in the first place.Providing relief reflects well on politicians (both in donor and recipientcountries) who are seen to be caring, taking action, and responding topublic demand (Eisensee and Stromberg, 2007). 
Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level300Major shares of the costs of disaster relief and recovery still fall on the
governments of disaster-affected countries. Bilateral relief is limited tomaterials from donor countries and most relief is subject to relativelystrict criteria to reduce perceived levels of corruption. In both cases,flexibility is heavily restricted. Relief can also produce local economicdistortions such as causing shops to lose business as the marketbecomes flooded with relief supplies. These problems can be overcomeby directly transferring cash to local people to buy building materials,seed, and the li ke. Such programs have performed well where local
supplies are available (Farrington and Slater, 2009). At the same time,there is the view that disaster relief can create a culture of dependencyand expectation at the local level (Burby, 2006), where disaster reliefbecomes viewed as an entitlement program as local communities arenot forced to bear the responsibility for their own locational choices,land use, and lack of mitigation practices.
5.2.2. Population Movements
A second coping strategy is population movements. Natural disasters
are linked with population movements in a number of ways (Hunter,
2005; Perch-Nielson et al., 2008; Warner et al., 2010). Evacuations occurbefore, during, and after some disaster events. Longer-term relocation of
affected communities sometimes occurs. Relocations can be temporary orpermanent. These different forms of population movements have variablesocial, psychological, health, and financial implications for the communities
concerned. Population movements may also be differentiated on the
basis of whether the mobility is voluntary or forced (displacement) andwhether or not international borders are crossed. Most contemporaryresearch views population mobility as a continuum from completely
voluntary movements to completely forced migrations (Laczko and
Aghazarm, 2009). The United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre
estimated that at least 36 million people were displaced by naturaldisasters in 2008. While these displaced people would come from andarrive at local origins and destinations there is little information on the
local implications and time frames of the displacement (UNOCHA andIDMC, 2009).
Where climate change increases the marginality of livelihoods and
settlements beyond a sustainable level, communities may be forced tomigrate or be displaced (McLeman and Smit, 2006). While migrationtypically has many causes, of which the environment (including climate)is just one factor, extremes often serve as precipitating events (Hugo,1996). Furthermore, a number of researchers consider that climate-related migration, other than forced displacement, may not necessarilybe a problem and indeed may be a positive adaptive response, withpeople who remain at the place of origin benefitting from remittances(Barnett and Webber, 2009; Tacoli, 2009). Nomadic pastoralists migrateas part of their livelihoods but often respond to disruptive events bymodifying their patterns of mobility (Anderson et al., 2010). Migrationis highly gendered in terms of both drivers and impacts, which differbetween men and women, although it is not clear how these differencesmight be played out in the context of climate change (Hugo, 2010).
Global estimations provide little insight into the local implications of such
large-scale migratory patterns. Migration will have local effect s, not only
for the communities generating the migrants, but those communitieswhere they may settle. Barnett and Webber (2009) also note that the lessvoluntary the migration choice is, the more disruptive it will become. Inthe context of dam construction, for example Hwang et al. (2007) foundthat communities anticipating forced migration experienced stress.Hwang et al. (2010) also found that forced migration directly led toincreased levels of depression and the weakening of social safeguardsin the relocation process. Much post-disaster relocation is temporary,which is also associated with psychological and social effects such asdisruption of social networks and trauma (Neria et al., 2009).
One outcome of climate change is that entire communities could be
required to relocate and in some cases, such as those living in atollChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
FAQ 5.2 | What lessons have been learned about effective disaster management and climate
change adaptation at the local scales?
In fostering sustainable and disaster-resilient areas, local response to climate extremes will require disaster risk management  that
acknowledges the role of climate variability and change and the associated uncertainties and that will contribute to long-term adaptation.
In order to anticipate the risks and uncertainties associated with climate change there are a number of emerging approaches andresponses at the local level. One set of responses focus on integrating information about changing climate risks into disaster planning
and scenario assessments of the future. Setting up plans in advance, for example, enabled communication systems to be strengthe ned
before the extreme event struck. Another is community-based adaptation (CBA), which helps to define solutions for managing risk s
while considering climate change. CBA responses provide increased participation by locals and recognition of the local context and the
access to adaptation resources and promote adaptive capacity within communities. A critical factor in community-based actions i s that
community members are empowered to take control of the processes involved. Scaling up community-based approaches poses achallenge as well as integrating climate information and other interventions such as ecosystem management and restoration, wate rshed
rehabilitation, agroecology, and forest landscape restoration . These types of interventions protect and enhance natural resources at the
local scale, improve local capacities to adapt to future climate, and may also address immediate development needs.301countries, the relocation will be international. Such relocation can have
significant social, cultural, and psychological impacts (Campbell, 2010b).Community relocation schemes are those in which whole communitiesare relocated to a new non-exposed site. Perry and Lindell (1997)examined one such instance in Allenville, Arizona. They developed a setof five principles for achieving positive outcomes in relocation projects:1) the community to be relocated should be organized; 2) all potentialrelocatees should be involved in the relocation decisionmaking process;3) citizens must understand the multi-organizational context in whichthe relocation is to be conducted; 4) special attention should begiven to the social and personal needs of the relocatees; and 5) socialnetworks need to be preserved. For many communities relocation isdifficult, especially in those communities with communal land ownership.In the Pacific Islands, for example, relocation within one’s own lands isleast disruptive but leaving it completely is much more difficult, as ismaking land available for people who have been relocated (Campbell,2010b). 
5.2.3. Recovery and Reconstruction
Recovery and reconstruction include actions that seek to establish orre-establish the everyday life of the locality affected by disaster (Hewitt,1997). Often reconstruction enables communities and businesses toreturn to the same conditions that existed prior to the disaster, and inso doing create the potential for further similar losses, thus reproducingthe same exposure that resulted in disaster in the first place (Jha et al.,2010). Recovery and reconstruction (especially housing rehabilitationand rebuilding) are among the more contentious elements of disasterresponse. One of the major issues surrounding recovery is the lackof clarity between recovery as a process and recovery as an outcome.The former emphasizes betterment processes where pre-existingvulnerability issues are addressed. The latter focuses on the materialmanifestation of recovery such as building houses or infrastructure.Often following large disasters, top-down programs result in rebuildinghouses but fail to provide homes (Petal et al., 2008). Moreover, hastein reconstruction, while achieving short-term objectives, often resultsin unsustainable outcomes and increasing vulnerability (Ingram et
al., 2006). As seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, there are
measureable local disparities in recovery, leading to questions of
recovery for whom and recovery to what (Curtis et al., 2010; Finch et
al., 2010; Stevenson et al., 2010). There are a number of obstacles to
effective and timely reconstruction including lack of labor, lack of
capacity among local construction companies, material shortages,
resolution of land tenure considerations, and insufficiency of funds
(Keraminiyage et al., 2008). While there is urgency to have people
re-housed and livelihoods re-established, long-term benefits may begained through carefully implemented reconstruction (Hallegatte, 2008;
Hallegatte and Dumas, 2009) in order to achieve greater disasterresilience. 
Most research on recovery and reconstruction has tended to focus on
housing and the so-called lifelines of infrastructure: electricity, watersupply, and transport links. Less is published on the equally important,
if indeed not more so, rehabilitation of livelihoods, and addressing theproblems of power inequities that often include land and resourcegrabbing by the economic and politically powerful after disaster in bothdeveloped and developing countries. Agricultural rehabilitation (e.g.,the provision of seeds, planting material, fertilizers, and stock, and theremediation of land) is particularly important where local livelihoodsare directly affected such as in subsistence or semi-subsistence societies(Dorosh et al., 2010). In addition, some climate-related disaster events,such as droughts, do not always directly destroy the built environmentinfrastructure (like flooding or tropical cyclones) so the rehabilitation oflivelihoods, in particular sustainable livelihoods, becomes an importantaspect of disaster risk reduction and development (Nakagawa andShaw, 2004).
As with relief, major problems can occur where planning and
implementation of recovery and reconstruction is taken out of thehands of the local communities concerned. In addition, the use ofinappropriate (culturally, socially, or environmentally) materials andtechniques may render rebuilt houses unsuitable for their occupants(Jha et al., 2010). As Davidson et al. (2007) found, this is often thecase and results in local community members having little involvementin decisionmaking for the recovery process; instead they are used toprovide labor. It is also important to acknowledge that post-disasterrecovery often does not reach all community members and in manyrecovery programs, the most vulnerable, those who have suffered thegreatest losses, often do not recover from disasters and endure long-term hardship (Wisner et al., 2004). In this context, it is important totake into account the diversity of livelihoods in many local areas and towork with local residents and stakeholders to develop strategies thatare potentially more resilient in the face of future events (Pomeroy etal., 2006).
During the post-recovery phase, reconstruction requires weighing,
prioritizing, and sequencing of policy programming, given the multiple,and sometimes competing agendas for most decisionmakers andoperational actors. Often there are opportunities for change in policydirections and agenda setting at local to national levels at this time(Birkland, 1997). The post-event lobbying for action and resourcesrequires a balance between short-term needs and long-term goals.The most significant is the pressure to quickly return to conditions priorto the event rather than incorporate longer-term and more sustainabledevelopment policies (Christoplos, 2006; Kates et al., 2006). How longsuch a window will stay open or precisely what factors will make itclose under a given set of conditions is not well known even thoughthree to six months has been recognized in specific cases (Kates et al.,2006). 
The most often used strategies for coping with present disaster risk at
the local level are emergency assistance (including disaster relief),population movements, and recovery and reconstruction. As illustratedabove, there is considerable variability among and between local placesin how these actions are implemented and the impacts of their use. Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level3025.3. Anticipating and Responding
to Future Disaster Risk
This section examines how local places anticipate future risks and how
they respond to them. In addition to enhanced communication, otherapproaches to anticipating and responding to future risks includestructural interventions such as dikes or dams, natural resources planning
and ecosystem protection, and storage and rationing of resources. 
5.3.1. Communicating Risk
Effective communication is necessary across the full cycle of disastermanagement: reduction, preparedness, response, and recovery, especially
at the local level where communications face particular constraints andpossibilities. A burgeoning field of research explores the barriers to
communicating the impacts of climate change to motivate constructivebehaviors and policy choices (Frumkin and McMichael, 2008).
Communicating the likelihood of extreme impacts of climate changealso presents an important and difficult challenge (Moser and Dilling,2007). Research on climate communications addresses how informationcan be designed, and the mechanisms and timing of its distribution. 
5.3.1.1. Message Design
As used here, the term risk communication refers to intentional efforts
on the part of one or more sources (e.g., international agencies, nationalgovernments, local government) to provide information about hazardsand hazard adjustments through a variety of channels to different audiencesegments (e.g., the general public, specific at-risk communities). Thecharacteristics of messages that have a significant impact on local adoptionof adjustments involve information quality (specificity, consistency, andsource certainty), information reinforcement (number of warnings andrepetition) (Mileti and O’Brien, 1992; O’Brien and Mileti, 1992; Miletiand Fitzpatrick, 1993), and the ways in which information is designed.Messages targeted to specific audiences are more readily received(Maibach et al., 2008) than those which are not. Targeting threats tofuture generations may generate more concern than overt actions to
reduce contemporary climate change impacts (Maibach et al., 2008). In
addition, communication is more effective when the informationregarding risk does not exceed the capacity for coping and therefore
galvanizes resilience (Fritze et al., 2008). Some research suggests that afocus on personal risk of specific damages of climate change can be a
central element in motivating interest and behavior change (Leiserowitz,
2007). Risk messages vary in threat specificity, guidance specificity,repetition, consistency, certainty, clarity, accuracy, and sufficiency (Miletiand Sorensen, 1990; Mileti and Peek, 2002). 
Communications that include social, 
interpersonal, physical, environmental,
and policy factors can foster civic engagement and social change
fundamental to reducing risk (Brulle, 2010). A participatory approachhighlights the need for multiple pathways of communication thatengenders credibility, trust, and cooperation (NRC, 1989; Frumkin
and McMichael, 2008), which are especially important in high-stresssituations such as those associated with climate extremes. For example,participatory video production is effective in communicating theextreme impacts of climate change (Suarez et al., 2008; Baumhardt etal., 2009). Participatory video involves a community or group creating
their own videos through storyboarding and production (Lunch and
Lunch, 2006). Such projects are traditionally used in contexts, such aspoor communities, where there are constraints to accessing accurateclimate information (Patt and Gwata, 2002; Patt and Schröter, 2008).Engaging with community leaders or opinion leaders in accessing socialnetworks through which to distribute information is another approach,traditionally used by health educators but also applicable to thetranslation of climate risks in a community context (Maibach et al.,2008). Another approach used in health communications that is relevantto climate education is the ‘community drama’ in which communitymembers engage in plays to communicate health risks (Middlekoop et al.,2006). These types of communication projects can motivate communityaction necessary to promote preparedness (Semenza, 2005; Jacobs etal., 2009).
Visualizing methods such as mapping, cartographic animations, and
graphic representations are also used to engage with stakeholders whomay be impacted by extreme events (McCall, 2008; A. Shaw et al.,2009). Many programs are developing ways to use visualizations tohelp decisionmakers adapt to a changing environment, suggesting thatsuch tools can increase climate literacy (Niepold et al., 2008).Visualizations can be powerful tools, but issues of validity, subjectivity,and interpretation must be seriously considered in such work(Nicholson-Cole, 2004). These communications are most effective whenthey take local experiences or points of view and locally relevant placesinto account (O’Neill and Ebi, 2009). Little evaluation has been done ofvisualization projects, therefore leaving a gap in understanding of howto most effectively communicate future risks of extreme events. 
5.3.1.2. Modes and Timing of Risk Communication
The generation and receipt of risk information occurs through a diversearray of channels. They include: interpersonal contact with particularresearchers; planning and conceptual foresight; outside consultation onthe planning process; user-oriented transformation of information; andindividual and organizational leadership (NRC, 2006). Researchers havelong recognized a variety of informal information source vehicles includingpeers (friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers) and news media(Drabek, 1986). These sources systematically differ in terms of suchcharacteristics as perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and protectionresponsibility (Lindell and Perry, 1992; Lindell and Whitney, 2000; Pulwarty,2007). Risk-area residents use information channels for different purposes:the internet, radio, and television are useful for immediate updates;meetings are useful for clarifying questions; and newspapers andbrochures are useful for retaining information that might be neededlater. In addition, within-community discussions on risks to livelihoods,Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level303such as during droughts, act as mechanisms for risk communication and
response actions (Dekens, 2007).
Policies and actions affecting communications and advanced warning
have a major impact on the adaptive capacity and resilience oflivelihoods. The collection and transmittal of weather- (and climate-)related information is often a governmental function and timelyissuance remains a key weakness in climate information systems,especially for communication passed on to communities from thenational early warning units (UNISDR, 2006). There are other localizedforms of communication that can be used rapidly, such as neighborhoodwatch systems (Lichterman, 2000). Some private communication methods,
such as text messaging, Facebook, and Twitter, may reach affected
populations before government directives (Palen et al., 2007). However,
some research shows that there has been too much reliance on one-way
devices for communication (such as the radio), which were felt to be
inadequate for agricultural applications (for example, farmers are not
able to ask further questions regarding the information provided)
(Ziervogel, 2004). Within many rural communities, low bandwidth and
poor computing infrastructure pose serious constraints to risk-message
receipt. Such gaps are evident in developed as well as lesser-developed
regions.
The degree of acceptability of information and trust in the providers
dictates the context of communicating disaster and climate information
(see Box 5-2). Pre-decisional processes (reception, attention, andcomprehension) influence the disaster message’s effectiveness (Lindell
and Perry, 2004). Several studies have identified the characteristics of
pre-decisional practices that lead to effective communication over thelong-term (Fischhoff, 1992; Cutter, 2001; Pulwarty, 2007). These include:
1) understanding the goals, objectives, and constraints of communitiesin the target system; 2) mapping practical pathways to different outcomescarried out as joint problem definition and fact-finding strategiesamong research, extension, and farmer communities; 3) bringing thedelivery persons (e.g., extension personnel, research community, etc.) toan understanding of what has to be done to translate current informationinto usable information; 4) interacting with actual and potential usersto better understand informational needs, desired formats of information,and timeliness of delivery; 5) assessing impediments and opportunitiesto the flow of information including issues of credibility, legitimacy,compatibility (appropriate scale, content, match with existing practice),and acceptability; and 6) relying on existing stakeholders’ networks andorganizations to disseminate and assess climate information andforecasts.
Much research has yet to be done regarding risk communication on
climate change. There has been little systematic investigation, forexample, on message effectiveness in prompting local action based ondiffering characteristics such as the precision of message dissemination,penetration into normal activities, message specificity, messagedistortion, rate of dissemination over time, receiver characteristics,sender requirements, and feedback (Lindell and Perry, 1992; NRC, 2006).Little research attention has been devoted to how information can bedistributed within a family, although the existing research does showthere are emotional, social, and structural barriers to such distribution(Norgaard, 2009). 
5.3.1.3. Warnings and Warning Systems
The disaster research community has shown that warnings of impendinghazards need to be complemented by information on the risks actuallyposed by the hazards as well as the potential strategies and pathwaysto mitigate the damage in the particular context in which they arise(Drabek, 1999; UNISDR, 2006). Local-level early warnings based ontraditional knowledge (e.g., water turning a different color, windsshifting) are frequently used. The use of radios, megaphones, and cellphones are also used at the local level to warn.
Effective early warning implies information interventions into an
environment where vulnerability is assumed (Olson, 2000). This backdropis reinforced through significant lessons that have been identified fromthe use of seasonal climate forecasts over the past 15 years (Podestá etal., 2002; Pulwarty, 2007). It is now widely accepted that the existenceof predictable climate variability and impacts are necessary but notsufficient to achieve effective use of climate information, includingseasonal forecasts. The practical obstacles to using information aboutfuture conditions at the local scale are diverse. They include: limitationsin modeling the climate system’s complexities (e.g., projections havingcoarse spatial and temporal resolution; limited predictability of somerelevant variables; and forecast skill characterization; see Chapter 3);procedural, institutional, and cognitive barriers in receiving orChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Box 5-2 | Successful Communication of Local
Risk-Based Climate Information
The following questions have been identified as shaping the
successful communication of risk-based climate information(Ascher, 1978; Fischhoff, 1992; Pulwarty, 2003):
•What do people know and believe about the risks being
posed?
•What is the past experience /outcomes of information
use?
•Is the new information relevant for decisions in the
particular community? 
•Are the sources/providers of information credible to the
intended user? 
•Are practitioners (e.g., farmers) receptive to the
information and to research? 
•Is the information accessible to the decisionmaker? 
•Is the information compatible with existing decision
models (e.g., for farming practice)? 
•Does the community (or individuals in the community)have the capacity to use information? 304understanding climatic information; and the capacity and willingness of
decisionmakers to modify actions (Kasperson et al., 1988; Stern andEasterling, 1999; Roncoli et al., 2001; Patt and Gwata, 2002; Marx et al.,2007). In addition, functional, structural, and social factors inhibit jointproblem identification and collaborative knowledge productionbetween providers and users. These include divergent objectives, needs,scope, and priorities; different institutional settings and standards; aswell as differing cultural values, understanding, and mistrust (Pulwartyet al., 2004; Rayner et al., 2005; Weichselgartner and Kasperson, 2010). 
Significant advances in warning systems in terms of improved monitoring,
instrumentation, and data collection have occurred (Case Study 9.2.11),but the management of the information and its dissemination to at-riskpopulations is still problematic (Sorensen, 2000). Researchers haveidentified several aspects of information communication, such as
stakeholder awareness, key relationships, and language and terminology,that are socially contingent in addition to the nature of the predictions
themselves. More is known about the effects of these message
characteristics on warning recipients than is known about the degree towhich generators and providers of information including hazards
researchers address them in their risk communication messages. Forexample, warnings may be activated (such as the tsunami early warningsystem), yet fail to reach potentially affected communities (Oloruntoba,
2005). Similarly, many communities do not have access to climate-
sensitive hazard warning systems such as tone alert radio, emergencyalert system, emergency phone numbers (reverse 911 in the United States,but in other parts of the world you call 110, 112, or other numbers), andthus never hear the warning message, let alone act upon the information(Sorensen, 2000). On the other hand, Valdes (1997) demonstrated that
flood warning systems based on community operation and participationin Costa Rica make a difference as to whether early warnings are acted
upon to save lives and property. Implementing community early warningsystems (such as the correlations of rain data and water levels amongmonitoring stations along the river) serves to encourage communities tobecome more proactive in their hazard mitigation approaches. 
Part of the research gap regarding risk communication stems from the
lack of projects that can be tested and shown to affect preparedness.On the most basic level, there is considerable understanding of theinformation needed for preparing for disasters, but less-specificunderstanding of what information and trusted communicationprocesses are necessary to generate local confidence and preparednessfor climate change (Fischhoff, 2007). The very discussion of climateforecasts and projections within potentially impacted communities hasserved as a vehicle for democratizing the drought discourse in Ceará inNortheast Brazil (Finan and Nelson, 2001). Developing a seamlesscontinuum across emergency responses, preparedness, and coping andadaptation requires insight into the demands that different types ofdisasters will place upon the local area and the need to performbasic emergency functions – pre-event assessments, proactive hazardsmitigation, and incident management (Lindell and Perry, 1996). As notedin previous IPCC reports (IPCC, 2007), preparing for short-term disastersenhances the capacity to adapt to longer-term climate change.
5.3.2. Structural Measures
Structural measures may be used to reduce the effects of climate-relatedevents such as floods, droughts, coastal erosion, and heat waves.Structural interventions to reduce the effects of extreme events oftenChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Box 5-3 | Large Dams in Brazil: Scalar Challenges to Climate Adaptation
Effective climate adaptation requires consideration of cross-scale management concerns. Any project or impact that crosses juri sdictions
from local to regional to national to transnational is best planned using a perspective that takes into account all levels of m anagement
(Adger et al., 2005). The planned or built large dams in Amazonia, Brazil (McCormick, 2011), exemplify these issues. These dams are
related to water management and would cross local, regional, and national boundaries. At the national level, these dams would p rovide
large-scale energy needs and serve major urban centers and industrial sectors across the country. At the regional level, the la rge
Amazonian dams could both generate energy and assist in drought management through storage of hydrological resources (Postel et al.,
1996). Because of the expansive range and impacts of large dams, their planning and management raise a variety of scalar concer ns
about climate adaptation. While on one level a dam may present benefits regionally and nationally, it may also cause seriousenvironmental and social problems locally (McCormick, 2009). For example, dams upstream may lead to erosion and inundation ofdeltas (Yang et al., 2011).
While there are many environmental benefits of hydroelectric power and large-scale water management, the uncertainty of climate
change could alter such benefits at local to global scales and influence the social and environmental ramifications of these pr ojects. For
example, the flooding caused by the construction of reservoirs could result in migration of locally affected communities, there by increasing
community fragmentation, poverty, and ill health of humans and biota (Kingsford, 2000). This becomes a local and regional impac t of
dam construction that may increase vulnerability to climate change in many localities. Changing rainfall patterns that affect r eservoir
levels could impact the availability of energy generation at the national level (DeLucena et al., 2009). Degradation of flora an d fauna
also results in additional greenhouse gas emissions at local to global scales (Fearnside, 1995).305employ engineering works to provide protection from flooding such as
dikes, embankments, seawalls, river channel modification, flood gates,and reservoirs. However, structural measures also include those thatstrengthen buildings (during construction and retrofitting), thatenhance water collection in drought-prone areas (e.g., roof catchments,water tanks, wells), and that reduce the effects of heat waves (e.g.,insulation and cooling systems). Although many of these structuralinterventions can achieve success in reducing disaster impacts, they canalso fail due to lack of maintenance, age, or due to extreme events thatexceed the engineering design level (Galloway, 2007; Doyle et al., 2008;Galloway et al., 2009). In the event that the frequency and magnitudeof extreme events increase as a result of climate change, new designlevels may be necessary. Technical considerations should also includelocal social, cultural, and environmental considerations (WMO, 2003;Opperman et al., 2009). 
Implementing structural measures from planning through implementation
that involve participatory approaches with local residents who areproactively involved often leads to increased local ownership and moresustainable outcomes. Such an example is a program of building,managing, and maintaining cyclone shelters in Bangladesh (Zimmermannand Stössel, 2011). One of the key reasons why sub-national structuralprojects are often ineffective is that they are approved on the basisof technical information alone, rather than based on both technicalinformation and local knowledge (ActionAid, 2005; Prabhakar et al.,2009; see also Section 5.4.4). In addition, national legislation hasimportant influences on the choice of disaster risk reduction strategiesat the local level as local and national institutional arrangements thatoften favor structural responses over other non-structural approaches(Burby, 2006; Galloway, 2009). Technological responses alone may alsohave unintended geomorphologic and social consequences, includingincreasing flood hazard in downstream locations, increasing costs oflong-term flood protection works, or increasing coastal erosion in areasdeprived of sediments by coastal protection works (Adger et al., 2005;Hudson et al., 2008; Box 5-3).
The method of protecting an entire area by building a dike has been in
use for thousands of years and is still being applied by communities inflood-prone countries. Embankments, dikes, levees, and floodwalls are
all designed to protect areas from flooding by confining the water to ariver channel, thus protecting the areas immediately behind them.
Building dikes is one of the most economical means of flood control
(Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, 2005). Dikes built by communities
normally involve low technology and traditional knowledge (such as
earth embankments). Sand bagging is also a very common form offlood-proofing. Generally, structures that are built of earth are highly
susceptible to erosion, leading to channel siltation and reduced water
conveyance on the wet side and slope instability and failure on the dry
side. Slopes can be stabilized by various methods, including turfing by
planting vegetation such as Catkin grass and Vetiver grass inBangladesh and Thailand, respectively. However there is a continuingdebate in the region as to whether the grass strips prevent erosion,
whether erosion is in fact the main problem instead of soil fertility, andwhether farmers still need slope stabilization (Forsyth and Walker,
2008). 
Decisionmaking for large-scale structural measures is often based on
cost-benefit analyses and technical approaches. In many cases,particularly in developed countries, structural measures are subsidizedby national governments and local governments and communities arerequired to cover only partial costs. In New Zealand, this led to apreponderance of structural measures despite planning legislation thatenabled non-structural measures. As a result, the potential for majordisasters was increased and development intensified in areas withstructural measures only to be seriously devastated by events thatexceeded the engineering design level (Ericksen, 1986). Reduction ofcentralized subsidies in the mid-1980s and changes in legislation sawgreater responsibility for the costs of disaster risk management fallingon the communities affected and a move toward more integrateddisaster risk reduction processes within New Zealand (Ericksen et al.,2000). Similar trends have been observed in relation to coastal protec tion,
where structural measures are often favored over non-structuraloptions (Titus et al., 2009; Titus, 2011).
Building codes closely align with engineering and architectural structural
approaches to disaster risk reduction (Petal et al., 2008; Kang et al.,2009). This is accompanied by the elevation of buildings and groundfloor standards in the case of flooding (Aerts et al., 2009; Kang et al.,2009). Though building code regulations exist, non-adoption, especiallyin developing countries, is problematic (Spence, 2004). Damages to thestructure occur not only because of noncompliance with the codes, butalso through a lack of inspections, the ownership status of the structure,and the political context and mechanisms of local governance (May andBurby, 1998). Insurance arrangements can provide incentives to localgovernments and households to implement building codes (Botzen etal., 2009).
Short-term risk reduction strategies can actually produce greater
vulnerability to future events as shown in diverse contexts such asENSO-related impacts in parts of Latin America, induced developmentbelow dams or levees in the United States, and flooding in the United
Kingdom (Bowden et al., 1981; Pulwarty et al., 2004; Berube and Katz,
2005; Penning-Rowsell et al., 2006). While locally based protection
works often enable areas to be productively used and will continue to
be needed for areas that are already densely settled, they are commonly
misperceived as providing complete protection, and actually increase
development – and thus vulnerability – in hazard-prone areas, resulting
in the so-called ‘levee effect’ (Tobin, 1995; Montz and Tobin, 2008). A
more general statement of this proposition is found in the safe development
paradox in which increased safety measures such as dams or levees
induce increased development, which in turn leads to increased exposure
and ultimately losses (Burby, 2006). The conflicting policy goals of rapid
recovery, safety, betterment, and equity and their relative strengths and
weaknesses largely reflect experience with large disasters in other
places and times. The actual decisions and rebuilding undertaken to
date clearly demonstrate the rush by government at all levels and theChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level306residents themselves to rebuild the familiar or increase risks in new
locations through displacement (Kates et al., 2006). Similarly, in drought-prone areas, provision of assured water supplies encourages thedevelopment of intensive agricultural systems – and for that matter,domestic water use habits – that are poorly suited to the inherentvariability of supply and will be even more so in areas projected tobecome increasingly arid in a changing climate (Chapter 3).
5.3.3. Land Use and Ecosystem Protection
Changes in land use not only contribute to global climate change butthey are equally reflective of adaptation to the varying signals ofeconomic, policy, and environmental change (Lambin et al., 2001). Localland use planning embedded in zoning, local comprehensive plans, and
retreat and relocation policies is a useful approach to disaster risk
management to keep people and property away from locations exposedto risk (Burby, 1998). However, some countries and rural areas may nothave formal land use regulations that restrict development or settlement.As land use management regulates the movement of people andindustries in hazard-prone zones, such policies face strong oppositionfrom development pressures, real estate interests accompanied byproperty rights, and local resistance against land acquisition (Burby,2000; Thomson, 2007). Buffer zones, setback lines in coastal zones, andinundation zones based on flood and sea level rise projections canresult in controversies and lack of enforcement that bring temporaryresettlement, land speculation, and creation of new vulnerabilities(Ingram et al., 2006; Jha et al., 2010). The government of Sri Lanka, forexample, created buffer zones after the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004,and relocated people to safer locations. Distance from people’s coastallivelihoods and social disruptions led to the revision of buffers and newresettlement (Ingram et al., 2006). In the United States, coastal retreatmeasures are difficult to implement as coastal property carries high valueand wealthy property owners can exert political pressure to build alongthe coast (Ruppert, 2008). Shorefront property owners and realtorsespecially oppose setback regulations because they consider theregulation to deter growth (NOAA, 2007).
Land use planning and the application of spatial hazard information is
another avenue for disaster risk management, especially hazard mitigation.Berke and Beatley (1992) examined a range of hazard mitigation measuresand ranked them according to effectiveness and ease of enforcement.
The most effective measures include land acquisition, density reduction,
clustering of development, building codes for new construction, and
mandatory retrofit of existing structures. The high cost of land acquisition
programs can make them unattractive to small communities. There has
been limited systematic scientific characterization of the ways in which
different hazard agents vary in their threats and characteristics, thus
require different pre-impact interventions and post-impact responses by
households, businesses, and community hazard management organizations.However, Burby et al. (1997) have found evidence for some communitiesthat previous occurrence of a disaster did not have a strong effect on
the number of hazard mitigation techniques subsequently employed.Formal approaches to land use planning as a means of disaster risk
management are often less appropriate for many rural areas in developingcountries where traditional practices and land tenure systems operate.Systems of land tenure often are very complex and flexible and cancontribute to vulnerability reduction. In the case of pastoralists in dry land
environments, sharing of land for grazing and of access to water areimportant drought responses (Anderson et al., 2010). This is not alwaysthe case and some land tenure systems marginalize certain groups andincrease their vulnerability (Clot and Carter, 2009; Robledo et al., 2011).There are also restrictions on land use planning in regards to slums andsquatter settlements. Poverty and the lack of infrastructure and servicesincrease the vulnerability of urban poor to adverse impacts from disasters,and national governments and international agencies have had littlesuccess in reversing such trends. As a result, successful efforts to reducehazard exposure have been locally led, built upon successful initiatives,and composed of informal measures rather than those imposed bygovernments at the local level (Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Zimmermannand Stössel, 2011).
Land acquisition is another means of protecting property and people by
relocating them away from hazardous areas (Olshansky and Kartez,1998). Many jurisdictions have the power of eminent domain to purchaseproperty but this is rarely used as a form of disaster risk management(Godschalk et al., 2000) or climate change adaptation. Voluntaryacquisition of land, for example, requires local authorities to purchaseexposed properties, which in turn enables households to obtain lessrisky real estate elsewhere without suffering large economic losses inthe process (Handmer, 1987), but this is rarely used in developingcountries because of lack of resources and political support. Given therapid population growth in coastal areas and in flood plains in manyparts of the world, and the large number and high value of exposedproperties in coastal zones in developed countries such as the UnitedStates and Australia, this buy out strategy is cost-prohibitive and thusrarely used (Anning and Dominey-Howes, 2009). Similarly, voluntaryacquisition schemes for developing countries are equally fraught withproblems as people have strong ties to the land, and land is heldcommunally in places like the Pacific Islands where community identitycannot be separated from the land to which its members belong(Campbell, 2010b). Land use planning alone, therefore, may not besuccessful as a singular strategy but when coupled with related policiessuch as tax incentives or disincentives, insurance, and drainage andsewage systems it could be effective (Yohe et al., 1995; Cheong, 2011b).However, if sea level rise adversely affects local coastal areas some formof relocation may become necessary in all exposed jurisdictions. In theUnited States, some state and local governments have adopted rollingeasement policies, which allow construction in vulnerable areas subjectto the requirement that the structures will be removed if and when thelandward edge of a wetland or beach encroaches (Titus, 2011).
Ecosystem conservation offers long-term protection from climate
extremes. The mitigation of soil erosion, landslides, waves, and stormsurges are some of the ecosystem services that protect people andinfrastructure from extreme events and disasters (Sudmeier-Rieux et al.,
Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level3072006). The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami attests to the utility of mangroves,
coral reefs, and sand dunes in alleviating the influx of large waves to theshore (Das and Vincent, 2009). The use of dune management districts toprotect property along developed shorelines has achieved success inmany places along the US eastern shore and elsewhere (Nordstrom,2000, 2008). Carbon sequestration is another benefit of ecosystem-based adaptation based on sustainable watershed and community forestmanagement (McCall, 2010). While the extent of their protectiveecosystem functions is still debated (Gedan et al., 2011), the merits ofecosystem services in general are proven, and development of quantifiedmodels of the services is well under way (Barbier et al., 2008; Nelson etal., 2009). These nonstructural measures are considered to be lessintrusive and more sustainable, and when integrated with engineeringresponses provide mechanisms for adapting to disasters and climateextremes (Galloway, 2007; Opperman et al., 2009; Cheong, 2011a).
5.3.4. Storage and Rationing of Resources
Communities may take a range of approaches to cope with disaster-induced shortages of resources, including producing surpluses andstoring them. If the surpluses are not available, rationing of food mayoccur. Many localities produce food surpluses that enable them tomanage during periods of seasonal or disaster-initiated disruptions totheir food supplies, although such practices were more prevalent in pre-capitalist societies. In Pacific Island communities, for example, foodcrops such as taro and breadfruit were often stored for periods up toand exceeding a year by fermentation in leaf-lined pits. Yams could bestored for several years in dry locations, and most communities main tained
famine foods such as wild yams, swamp taro, and sago, which were onlyharvested during times of food shortage (Campbell, 2006). The provisionof disaster relief, among other factors, has seen these practices decline(Campbell, 2010a). In Mali, women store part of their harvest as a hedgeagainst drought (Intercooperation, 2008). Stockpiling and prepositioningof emergency response equipment, materials, foods, and pharmaceuticalsand medical equipment is also an important form of disaster preparednessat the local level, especially for many indigenous communities. 
Rationing may be seen as the initial response to food shortages at or
near the onset of a food crisis. However, in many cases rationing is
needed on a seasonal basis. Rationing at the local level is often self-
rationing instituted at the level of households – particularly poor ones
without the ability to accumulate wealth or surpluses. Often, rationing
initially occurs among women and children (Hyder et al., 2005;
Ramachandran, 2006). Most rationing takes place in response to
food shortages and is, for most poor communities, the first response
to the disruption of livelihoods (Walker, 1989; Barrett, 2002; Devereuxand Sabates-Wheeler, 2004; Baro and Deubel, 2006). In many casesincreases in food prices force those with insufficient incomes to ration
as well. 
When the food shortage becomes too severe, households may reduce
future security by eating seeds or selling livestock, followed by severeillness, migration, starvation, and death if the shortages persist. While
climate change may alter the frequency and severity of droughts (seeSection 3.5.1), the causes of food crises are multi-faceted and oftenlie in social, economic, and political processes in addition to climaticvariability (Sen, 1981; Corbett, 1988; Bohle et al., 1994; Wisner et al., 2004).
Food rationing is unusual in developed countries where most communities
are not based on subsistence production. Welfare systems and NGOagencies respond to needs of those with livelihood deficits in thesecountries. However, other forms of rationing do exist particularly inresponse to drought events. Reductions in water use are achievedthrough a number of measures including: metering, rationing (fixedamounts, proportional reductions, or voluntary reductions), pressurereduction, leakage reduction, conservation devices, education, plumbingcodes, market mechanisms (e.g., transferable quotas, tariffs, pricing),and water use restrictions (Lund and Reed, 1995; Froukh, 2001).
Electricity supplies may also be disrupted by disaster events resulting in
partial or total blackouts. While a number of countries have nationalelectrical grids, decisions on responses to shortages are often made atlocal levels causing considerable disruption to other services, domesticcustomers, and to businesses. Rose et al. (2007) show that manyAmerican businesses can be quite resilient in such circumstances,adapting a variety of strategies including conserving energy, usingalternative forms of energy, using alternative forms of generation,rescheduling activities to a future date, or focusing on the low- or no-energy elements of the business operation. Rose and Liao (2005) hadsimilar findings for water supply disruption. Electricity storage (inadvance) and rationing may also be required when low precipitationreduces hydroelectricity production, a possible scenario in some placesunder climate projections (Vörösmarty et al., 2000; Boyd and Ibarrarán,2009). In some cases there may be competition among a range of sec tors
including industry, agriculture, electricity production, and domesticwater supply (Vörösmarty et al., 2000) that may have to be addressedthrough rationing and other measures such as those listed above.Clear rules outlining which consumers have priority in using water orelectricity is important.
Other elements that may be rationed as a result of natural hazards or
disasters include prioritization of medical and health services wheredisasters may simultaneously cause a large spike in numbers requiringmedical assistance and a reduction in medical facilities, equipment,pharmaceuticals, and personnel. This may require classifying patientsand giving precedence to those with the greatest need and the highestlikelihood of a positive outcome. This approach seeks to achieve thebest results for the largest number of people (Alexander, 2002; Isersonand Moskop, 2007).
Responding to future disaster risk will entail multiple approaches at the
local level. Starting with risk communication and warning information,the following dominate the range of adjustments local areas presentlyundertake in responding to future risks: structural measures, land useplanning, ecosystem protection, and storage and rationing of resources.Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level3085.4. Building Capacity at the Local Level for
Risk Management in a Changing Climate
Local risk management has traditionally dealt with extreme events
without considering the climate change context. This section providesexamples of adaptations to disaster risk and how such proactive behaviorsat the community level by local government and NGOs provide guidance
for reducing the longer-term impacts of climate change. Although
reacting to extreme events and their impacts is important, it is crucial tofocus on building the resilience of communities, cities, and sectors inorder to ameliorate the impacts of extreme events now and into thefuture. 
5.4.1. Proactive Behaviors and Protective Actions
Researchers have identified some of the physical and social characteristicsthat allow for the adoption of effective partnerships and implementationpractices during events (Birkland, 1997; Pulwarty and Melis, 2001). Theseinclude the occurrence of previous strong focusing events (such ascatastrophic extreme events) that generate significant public interestand the personal attention of key leaders, a social basis for cooperationincluding close inter-jurisdictional partnerships, and the existence of asupported collaborative framework between research and management. 
Factors conditioning this outcome have been summed up by White et al.
(2001) as “knowing better and losing even mor e.” In this context,
knowing better indicates the accumulation of readily available knowledgeon drivers of impacts and effective risk management practices. Forinstance, researchers had understood the consequences of a majorhurricane hitting New Orleans prior to Hurricane Katrina with fairlydetailed understanding of planning and response needs. This knowledgeappears to have been ignored at all levels of government including thelocal level after Hurricane Katrina (Kates et al., 2006). White et al. (2001)offer four explanations for why such conditions exist from an informationstandpoint: 1) knowledge continues to be flawed by areas of ignorance;2) knowledge is available but not used effectively; 3) knowledge is usedeffectively but takes a long time to have an impact; and 4) knowledgeis used effectively in some respects but is overwhelmed by increases invulnerability and in population, wealth, and poverty. Another possibilityis that some individuals or communities choose to take the risk. For
example, there is some evidence that the value of living near the coast,especially in developed countries, pays back the cost of the structure in
a few years due to increases in housing values (Kunreuther et al., 2009),
so the risk is worth taking by the individual and the community. Finally,
knowledge is often discounted. 
Individuals can make choices to reduce their risk but social relations,
context, and certain structural features of the society in which they liveand work mediate these choices and their effects. The recognition that
dealing with risk and insecurity is a central part of how poor peopledevelop their livelihood strategies is giving rise to prioritizing disaster
mitigation and preparedness as important components of many povertyalleviation agendas (Cuny, 1983; Olshansky and Kartez, 1998; UNISDR,
2009). A number of long-standing challenges remain as the larger andlooser coalitions of interests that sometimes emerge after disasters rarelylast long enough to sustain the kind of efforts needed to reduce presentdisaster risk, let alone climate extremes in a climate change context. 
At the household and community level, individuals often engage in
protective actions to minimize the impact of extreme events onthemselves, their families, and their friends and neighbors. In somecases individuals ignore the warning messages and choose to stay inplaces of risk. The range and choice of actions are often event specific
and time dependent, but they are also constrained by location, adequateinfrastructure, socioeconomic characteristics, access to disaster risk
information, and risk perception (Tierney et al., 2001). For example,evacuation is used when there is sufficient warning to temporarilyrelocate out of harm’s way such as for tropical storms, flooding, andwildfires. Collective evacuations are not always possible given thelocation, population size, transportation networks, and the rapid onset ofthe event. At the same time, individual evacuation may be constrainedby a host of factors ranging from access to transportation, monetaryresources, health impairment, job responsibilities, gender, and thereluctance to leave home. There is a consistent body of literature onhurricane evacuations in the United States, for example, that finds:1) individuals tend to evacuate as family units, but they often use morethan one private vehicle to do so; 2) social influences (neighbors, family,friends) are key to individual and households evacuation decisionmaking;if neighbors are leaving then the individual is more inclined to evacuateand vice versa; 3) risk perception, especially the personalization of riskby individuals, is a more significant factor in prompting evacuation thanprior adverse experience with hurricanes; 4) pets and concerns aboutproperty safety reduce household willingness to evacuate; and 5) socialand demographic factors (age, presence of children, elderly, or pets inhouseholds, gender, income, disability, and race or ethnicity) eitherconstrain or motivate evacuation depending on the particular context(Perry and Lindell, 1991; Dow and Cutter, 1998, 2000, 2002; Whiteheadet al., 2000; Bateman and Edwards, 2002; Van Willigen et al., 2002;Sorensen et al., 2004; Lindell et al., 2005; Dash and Gladwin, 2007;McGuire et al., 2007; Sorensen and Sorensen, 2007; Edmonds andCutter, 2008; Adeola, 2009). Culture also plays an important role inevacuation decisionmaking (Clot and Carter, 2009). For example, recentstudies in Bangladesh have shown that there are high rates of non-evacuation despite improvements in warning systems and the constructionof shelters. While there are a variety of reasons for this, gender issues(e.g., shelters were dominated by males, shelters didn’t have separatespaces for males and females) have a major influence upon females notevacuating (Paul and Dutt, 2010; Paul et al., 2010).
A different protective action, shelter-in-place, occurs when there is little
time to act in response to an extreme event or when leaving thecommunity would place individuals more at risk (Sorensen et al., 2004).Seeking higher ground or moving to higher floors in residential struc tures
to get out of rising waters is one example. Another is the movement intointerior spaces within buildings to seek refuge from strong winds. In the
Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level309case of wildfires, shelter-in-place becomes a back-up strategy when
evacuation routes are restricted because of the fire and include protectingthe structure with garden hoses or finding a safe area such as a waterbody (lake or backyard swimming pool) as temporary shelter (Cova etal., 2009). In Australia, the shelter-in-place action is slightly different.Here the local community engagement with wildfire risks has two options:stay and defend or leave early. In this context, the decisions to remainare based on social networks, prior experience with wildfires, gender(males will remain to protect and guard property), and involvementwith the local fire brigade (McGee and Russell, 2003). The study also
found that rural residents were more self-reliant and prepared to defend
then suburban residents (McGee and Russell, 2003).
The social organization of societies dictates the flexibility in the choice
of protective actions – some are engaged in voluntarily (such as in the
United States, Australia, and Europe), while other protective actions for
individuals or households are coordinated by centralized authoritiessuch as Cuba and China. Planning for disasters is a way of life for Cuba,where everyone is taught at an early age to mobilize quickly in the case
of a natural disaster (Sims and Vogelmann, 2002; Bermejo, 2006). Theorganization of civil defense committees at block, neighborhood, and
community levels working in conjunction with centralized governmentalauthority makes the Cuban experience unique (Sims and Vogelmann, 2002;Bermejo, 2006). Recent experience with hurricanes affecting Cuba suggeststhat such efforts are successful because there has been little loss of life. In many traditional or pre-capitalist societies it appears that mechanisms
existed that protected community members from periodic shocks such asnatural hazards. These mechanisms, sometimes referred to as the moral
economy , were underpinned by reciprocity and limiting exploitation so
that everyone had basic security. The mechanisms are often linked tokinship networks, and serve to redistribute resources to reduce the impactson those who had sustained severe losses, and have been identified inSoutheast Asia (Scott, 1976), Western Africa (Watts, 1983), and thePacific Islands (Paulson, 1993). The moral economy incorporated social,cultural, political, and religious arrangements, which ensured that allcommunity members had a minimal level of subsistence (see Box 5-4).For example, traditional political systems in the semiarid Limpopo Basinin northern South Africa enabled chiefs to reallocate surpluses duringbad years, but this practice has declined under contemporary systemswhere surpluses are sold (Dube and Sekhwela, 2008). In NorthernKenya, social security networks existed among some groups of nomadicpastoralists that enabled food and livestock stock to be redistributedfollowing drought events, but these are also breaking down with themonetization of the local economy, among other factors (Oba, 2001). 
Although the concept of moral economy is generally associated with
pre-capitalist societies and those in transition to capitalism (in the past),significant features of moral economy, such as reciprocity, barter, cropsharing, and other forms of cooperation among families and communitiesor community-based management of agricultural lands, waters, or woodsare still part of the social reality of developing countries that cannot beconsidered anymore as pre-capitalist. Many studies show that moraleconomy-based social relationships are still present such as traditionalinstitutions regulating access, use, and on-going redistribution ofcommunity-owned land (Sundar and Jeffery, 1999; Rist, 2000; Hughes,2001; Trawick, 2001; Rist et al., 2003). The revitalization, enhancement,and innovation of such moral economy-based knowledge, technologies,and forms of cooperation and interfamily organization represent animportant and still existing source of fostering collective action thatserves as an enabling condition for preventing and coping with hazardsrelated to natural resource management. While aspects of the traditionalmoral economy have declined in many societies, informal networksremain important in disaster risk reduction (see Section 5.4.3).
The notion of the moral economy does not recognize the inequalities in
some of the social systems that enabled such practices to be sustained(e.g., gender-based power relationships) and tended to perhaps providean unrealistic notion of a less risky past. In addition, kinship-basedsharing networks may foster freeloading among some members (diFalcoand Bulte, 2009). Nevertheless, a reduction in traditional copingmechanisms including the moral economy is reflected in growingdisaster losses and increasing dependency on relief (Campbell, 2006).
Collective action to prepare for or respond to disaster risk and extreme
climate impacts can also be driven by localized organizations and socialmovements. Many such groups represent networks or first respondersfor climate-sensitive disasters. However, there are many constraints thatthese movements face in building effective coalitions including the needChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Box 5-4 | Collective Behavior and the
Moral Economy at Work
A variety of socio-political networks that were used to offset
disaster losses existed throughout the Pacific region prior tocolonization (Sahlins, 1962; Paulson, 1993). One example ofsuch a system is the Suqe , or graded society, which existed in
northern Vanuatu, a small island nation in the South WestPacific Ocean. In the Suqe ‘big men’ achieved the highest
status by accumulating surpluses of valued goods such as shellmoney, specially woven mats, and pigs. Men increased theirgrade within the system by making payments of these goodsto men of higher rank. In accumulating the items men wouldalso accumulate obligations to those they had borrowed from.Accordingly, networks and alliances emerged among theislands of northern Vanuatu. When tropical cyclones destroyedcrops, the obligations could be called in and assistance givenfrom members of the networks who lived in islands thatescaped damage (Campbell, 1990). A number of processesassociated with colonialism (changes to the socio-politicalorder), the introduction of the cash economy (the replacementof shell money), and religious conversion that resulted in thebanning of the Suqe ), as well as the provision of post-disaster
relief, have caused a number of elements of the moral economyto fall into disuse (Campbell, 2006).310to connect with other movement organizations and frame the problem in
an accessible way (McCormick, 2010). One means of mobilizing collectiveresponses at the local level is through participatory approaches todisaster risk reduction such as Community-Based Disaster Reduction orCommunity-Based Disaster Preparedness (see Section 5.6.2). Suchapproaches build on local needs and priorities, knowledge, and socialstructures and are increasingly being used in relation to climate changeadaptation (Reid et al., 2009). 
5.4.2. Empowerment for Local Decisionmaking
A critical factor in community-based disaster risk reduction is thatcommunity members are empowered to take control of the processesinvolved. Marginalization (Mustafa, 1998; Adger and Kelly, 1999; Polack,2008) and disempowerment (Hewitt, 1997) are critical factors in creatingvulnerability and efforts to reduce these characteristics play an importantrole in building resilient communities. In this chapter, empowerment
refers to giving community members control over their lives with supportfrom outside (Sagala et al., 2009). This requires external facilitators torespect community structures and traditional and local knowledgesystems, to assist but not take a dominating role, to share knowledge,and to learn from community members (Petal et al., 2008). A key elementin empowering communities is building trust between the communityand the external facilitators (Sagala et al., 2009). In the Philippines, forexample, Allen (2006) found that many aspects of community disasterpreparedness such as building on local institutions and structures, buildinglocal capacity to act independently, and building confidence throughachieving project outcomes were already present. She also found thatwhere agencies focused on the physical hazard as the cause of disastersand neglected the underlying causes of the social vulnerability withinthese small specific projects, the result was disempowerment. It is alsoimportant to note that communities have choices from a range ofdisaster management options (Mercer et al., 2008). Empowerment incommunity-based disaster risk management may also be applied to
groups within communities whose voice may otherwise not be heard or
who are in greater positions of vulnerability (Wisner et al., 2004). These
include women (Wiest et al., 1994; Bari, 1998; Clifton and Gell, 2001;
Polack, 2008) and disabled people (Wisner, 2002).
Another key element of empowerment is ownership of or responsibility
for disaster management (Buvinić et al., 1999). This applies to allaspects of the disaster, from the ownership of a disaster itself so thatthe community has control of relief and reconstruction, to a local
project to improve preparedness. Empowerment and ownership ensurethat local needs are met, that community cohesion is sustained, and
a greater chance of success of the disaster management process.
Empowerment and ownership of the disaster impacts may be
particularly important in achieving useful (for the locality) post-disasterassessments (Pelling, 2007). It is important for external actors toidentify those voices who speak for the local constituencies. Also,
accountability and governance of disaster and climate management
issues is growing in importance. 5.4.3. Social Drivers
Similar to empowerment is the role of localized social norms, socialcapital, and social networks as these also shape behaviors and actionsbefore, during, and after extreme events. Each of these factors operateson their own and in some cases also intersects with the others. As
vulnerability to disasters and climate change is socially constructed
(Sections 2.4 and 2.5.2), the breakdown of collective action often leadsto increased vulnerability. Norms regarding gender also play a role indetermining outcomes. For example, women were more prone todrowning than men during the Asian tsunami because they were lessable to swim and because they were attempting to save their children(Rofi et al., 2006; Section 2.5.8). 
Social norms are rules and patterns of behavior that reflect expectations
of a particular social group (Horne, 2001). Norms structure many differentkinds of action regarding climate change (Pettenger, 2007). Norms areembedded in formal institutional responses, as well as informal groupsthat encounter disasters (Raschky, 2008). Norms of reciprocity, trust,and associations that bridge social divisions are a central part of socialcohesion that fosters community capacity (Kawachi and Berkman, 2000).A number of types of groups drive norms and, consequently, vulnerability,including religious, neighborhood, cultural, and familial groups (Brenkertand Malone, 2005). In the occurrence of extreme events, affectedgroups interact with one another in an attempt to develop a set ofnorms appropriate to the situation, otherwise known as the emergentnorm theory of collective behavior (NRC, 2006). This is true of those firstaffected at the local level whose norms and related social capital affectcapacity for response (Dolan and Walker, 2004). 
Social capital is a multifaceted concept that captures a variety of social
engagements within the community that bonds people and generates apositive collective value. It is also an important element in disasterpreparedness, coping, and response. It is an important element in theface of climate extremes because community social resources such asnetworks, social obligations, trust, and shared expectations create socialcapital to prevent, prepare, and cope with disasters (Dynes, 2006). Inclimate change adaptation, scholars and policymakers increasinglypromote social capital as a long-term adaptation strategy (Adger, 2003;Pelling and High, 2005). Although often positive, social capital can havesome negative outcomes. Internal social networks are oftentimes self-referential and insular (Portes and Landolt, 1996; Dale and Newman, 2010).This results in a closed society that lacks innovation and diversity, whichare essential elements for climate change adaptation. Disaster itself isoverwhelming, and can lead to the erosion of social capital and thedemise of the community (Ritchie and Gill, 2007). This invites externalengagement beyond local-level treatment of the disaster and extremeevents (Brondizio et al., 2009; Cheong, 2010). The inflow of external aids,expertise, and the emergence of new groups to cope with disaster areindicative of bridging and linking social capital beyond local boundaries. 
Social capital is embedded in social networks (Lin, 2001), or the social
structure composed of individuals and organizations, through multipleChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level311types of dependency, such as kinship, financial exchange, or prestige
(Wellman and Berkowitz, 1988). Social networks provide a diversity offunctions, such as facilitating sharing of expertise and resources acrossstakeholders (Crabbé and Robin, 2006). Networks can function to promotemessages within communities through preventive advocacy, or theengagement of advocates in promoting preventive behavior (Weibel,1988). Information about health risks has often been effectively distributedthrough a social network structure using opinion leaders as a guide(Valente and Davis, 1999; Valente et al., 2003), and has promisingapplication for changing behavior regarding climate adaptation(Maibach et al., 2008). Such opinion leaders may span a range of types,from formally elected officials, celebrities, and well-known leaders, tolocal community members who are well-embedded in local socialnetworks. It is important to note that more potential has been shown ininfluencing behavior through community-level interventions thanthrough individual-level directives at the population level (Kawachi andBerkman, 2000). Local and international networks can support thedevelopment of policies and practices that result in greater preparedness(Tompkins, 2005). Local resilience in the face of climate change can befostered by strong social networks that support effective responses(Ford et al., 2006). For example, networks facilitate the transmission ofinformation about risks (Berkes and Jolly, 2001). Therefore, communitieswith stronger social networks appear to be better prepared for extremeclimate impacts because of access to information and social support(Buckland and Rahman, 1999). 
At the same time, it is important to note that social networks may not
always be sufficient to foster effective adaptation to extreme events.Some social networks actually discourage people from moving awayfrom high risk zones, such as has been the case in storms and floodswhen residents have not wanted to leave (Eisenman et al., 2007). Theimpacts of climate change itself may also change the structure and utilityof social networks. As people migrate away from climate and other risksor are pulled toward alternative locations for social or ecologicalresources, those left behind can experience fragmented or weakenedsocial networks. The utilization of social networks can also be preventedby the status of particular social groups, such as illegal and legal settlersor immigrants (Wisner et al., 2004). Other social and environmental
contextual factors must be considered when conceptualizing the role of
social networks in managing extreme events. For example, strong social
networks have facilitated adaptability in Inuit communities, but are being
undermined by the dissolution of traditional ways of life (Ford et al., 2006).
5.4.4. Integrating Local Knowledge
Local and traditional knowledge is increasingly valued as important
information to include when preparing for disasters (McAdoo et al.,
2009; R. Shaw et al., 2009). It is embedded in local culture and socialinteractions and transmitted orally over generations (Berkes, 2008). Place-based memory of vulnerable areas, know-how for responding to recurrentextreme events, and detection of abnormal environmental conditions
manifest the power of local knowledge. Because local knowledge isoften tacit and invisible to outsiders, community participation in disaster
management is essential to tap this information as it can offer alternativeperspectives and approaches to problem-solving (Battista and Baas,2004; Turner and Clifton, 2009).
Within a climate change context, indigenous people as well as long-term
residents often conserved their resources in situ , providing important
information about changing environmental conditions as well as activelyadapting to the changes (Salick and Byg, 2007; Macchi et al., 2008;Salick and Ross, 2009; Turner and Clifton, 2009). Research is emergingthat helps to document changes that local people are experiencing(Ensor and Berger, 2009; Salick and Ross, 2009). Although this evidencemight be similar to scientific observations from external researchers, thefact that local communities are observing it is initiating discussionsabout existing and potential adaptation to climate changes from withinthe community.
The following example is illustrative. In six villages in eastern Tibet, near
Mt. Khawa Karpo, local documentation of warmer temperatures, lesssnow, and glacial retreat across areas were consistent, whereas otherobservations were more varied, including those for river levels andlandslide incidences (Byg and Salick, 2009). In Gitga’at (Coast Tsimshian)Nation of Hartley Bay, British Columbia, indigenous people observe thedecline of some species but also new appearances of others, anomaliesin weather patterns, and declining health of forests and grasslands thathave affected their ability to harvest food (Turner and Clifton, 2009). TheAlaska Native Tribal Health Consortium generated climate change andhealth impact assessment reports from observations, data, and traditionalecological knowledge (ANTHC, 2011). Other than knowledge fromindigenous groups, local knowledge associated with contemporarysocieties and cities exists though more research is needed in this area(Hordijk and Baud, 2011).
Integration of local knowledge with external scientific, global, and
technical knowledge is an important dimension of climate changeadaptation and disaster management. Experiences in environmentalmanagement and integrated assessment suggest mechanisms for suchknowledge transfers from the bottom up and from the top down (Burtonet al., 2007; Prabhakar et al., 2009). For example, communities set uptrusted intermediaries to transfer and communicate external knowledgesuch as technology-based early warning systems and innovative andsustainable farming techniques that incorporate the local knowledgesystem (Bamdad, 2005; Kristjanson et al., 2009). Another example is there-engineering of local practices to adapt to climate change as shownin the conversion of traditional dry-climate adobe construction to morestabilized earth construction built to withstand regular rainfall. Theutilization of participatory methods to draw in the perspectives of localstakeholders for subsequent input into hazards vulnerability assessmentsor climate change modeling or scenario development is well documented.Stakeholder interactions and related workshops using participatory ormediated modeling elicit discussions of model assumptions, local impacts,consistencies of observed and modeled patterns, and adaptationstrategies (Cabrera et al., 2008; Langsdale et al., 2009).Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level312Obstacles to utilizing local knowledge as part of adaptation strategies
exist. Climate-induced biodiversity change threatens historical copingstrategies of indigenous people as they depend on the variety of wildplants, crops, and their environments particularly in times of disaster(Turner and Clifton, 2009). In dryland areas such as in Namibia andBotswana, one of the indigenous strategies best adapted to frequentdroughts is livestock herding, including nomadic pastoralism (Ericksenet al., 2008). Decreased access to water sources through fencing andprivatization has inhibited this robust strategy. Also in Botswana, it hasbeen suggested that government policies have weakened traditionalinstitutions and practices, as they have not adequately engaged with localcommunity institutions and therefore the mechanisms for redistributingresources have not been strengthened sufficiently (Dube and Sekhwela,2008). 
5.4.5. Local Government and Nongovernment
Initiatives and Practices
Governance structures are pivotal to addressing disaster risk and
informing responses as they help shape efficiency, effectiveness, equity,and legitimacy (Adger et al., 2003; UNISDR, 2009). Some places centralizeclimate change management practices at the national level (seeChapter 6). This may be due to the ways in which many climateextremes affect environmental systems that cross political boundariesresulting in discordance if solely locally managed (Cash and Moser,2000) but could also be based on old practices of operations. In otherplaces, actions are more decentralized, emerging at the local level andtailored to local contexts (Bizikova et al., 2008). If multiple levels ofplanning are to be implemented, mechanisms for facilitation and guid ance
at the local level are needed in order that fairness is guaranteed duringthe implementation of national policies at the local scale (Thomas andTwyman, 2005). Local governments play an important role as they areresponsible for providing infrastructure, preparing and responding todisasters, developing and enforcing planning, and connecting nationalgovernment programs with local communities (Huq et al., 2007; UNISDR,2009). The quality and provision of these services have an impact ondisaster and climate risk (Tanner et al., 2009). Effective localized
planning, for example, can minimize both the causes and consequences
of climate change (Bulkeley, 2006).
Though local government-led climate adaptation policies and initiatives
are less pronounced than climate change mitigation measures, a growingnumber of cities and sub-national entities are developing adaptation
plans, but few have implemented their strategies (Heinrichs et al., 2009;
Birkmann et al., 2010). The Greater London Authority (2010), for example,has prepared a Public Consultation Draft of their climate change
adaptation strategy for London. The focus of this is on the changing risk
of flood, drought, and heat waves through the century and actions for
managing them. Some of the actions include improvement in managing
surface water flood risk, an urban greening program to buffer the
impacts from floods and hot weather, and retrofitting homes to improvewater and energy efficiency. ICLEI, a non-profit network of more than1,200 local government members across the globe, provides web-based
information (www.iclei.org) in support of local sustainability effortsusing customized tools and case studies on assessing climate resilienceand climate change adaptation.
Some assessments of urban adaptations exist. For example, adaptation
efforts in eight cities (Bogotá, Cape Town, Delhi, Pearl River Delta, Pune,Santiago, Sao Paulo, and Singapore) tend to support existing disastermanagement strategies (Heinrichs et al., 2009). Another study comparingboth formal adaptation plans and less formal adaptation studies in nine
cities including Boston, Cape Town, Halifax, Ho Chi Minh City, London,
New York, Rotterdam, Singapore, and Toronto demonstrates that thefocus is mostly on risk reduction and the protection of citizens andinfrastructure, with Rotterdam seeing adaptation as opportunity fortransformation (Birkmann et al., 2010). These nine cities have focusedmore on expected biophysical impacts than on socioeconomic impactsand have not had a strong focus on vulnerability and the associatedsusceptibility or coping capacity. Despite the intention that city adaptation
responses aim at an integrated approach, they tend to have sectoralresponses, with limited integration of local voices. There is a goodunderstanding of the impacts, but the implementation of policy andoutcomes on the ground are harder to see (Bulkeley, 2006; Burch andRobinson, 2007).
In these adaptation strategies, the size of the local government is
important, and it varies depending on the population and location.Primate and large cities exert more independence, whereas smallermunicipalities depend more on higher levels of the government units,and often form associations to pool their resources (Lundqvist andBorgstede, 2008). In the latter case, state-mandated programs and state-generated grants are the main incentives to formulate mitigation policies(Aall et al., 2007) and can be applicable to adaptation policies. Lack ofresources and capabilities has led to outsourcing of local adaptationplans, and can generate insensitive and unrefined local solutions andmore reliance on technological fixes (Crabbé and Robin, 2006).
The history and process of decentralization are significant in the capacity
of the local government to formulate and implement adaptation policies.Aligning local climate adaptation policies with the state/provincial andnational/federal units is a significant challenge for local governments(Roberts, 2008; van Aalst et al., 2008). The case of decentralization inclimate change adaptation is relatively new, and we can draw somelessons from decentralized natural resource management and crisismanagement. One of the problems of decentralization has been thecomplexity and uniqueness of each locality that policy planners oftenfailed to take into account because of the lack of understanding andconsultation with the local community, and this could result inrecentralizing the entire process in some instances (Ribot et al., 2006;Geiser and Rist, 2009). Some remedies include working with localinstitutions, ensuring appropriate transfer of various rights and access,and providing sufficient time for the process (Ribot, 2003). The crisismanagement literature also points out that there has been a lack ofcoordination and integration between central and local governmentsChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level313(Waugh and Streib, 2006; Schneider, 2008). Moynihan (2009) suggests a
networked collaboration as a solution and posits that even a hierarchicaldisaster management structure such as the incident command system inthe United States operates on the network principles of negotiation, trust,and reciprocity.
Although government actors play a key rol e, it is evident that partner ships
between public, civic, and private actors are crucial in addressing climatehazards-related adaptation (Agrawal, 2010). While international agencies,the private sector, and NGOs play a norm-setting agenda at provincial,state, and national levels, community-based organizations (CBOs) oftenhave greater capacity to mobilize at the local scale (Milbert, 2006). NGOand CBO networks play a critical role in capturing the realities of locallivelihoods, facilitating sharing information, and identifying the role oflocal institutions that lead to strengthened local capacity (Bull-Kamanga et al., 2003). Strong city-wide initiatives are often based onstrategic alliances, and local community organizations are essential tomaking city planning operational (Hasan, 2007). This can be seen in thecase of the New York City Panel on Climate Change that acted as ascientific advisory group to both Mayor Bloomberg’s Office of Long-term Planning and Sustainability and the New York City Climate ChangeAdaptation Task Force, a stakeholder group of approximately 40 publicagencies and private sector organizations that manage the criticalinfrastructure of the region (Rosenzweig et al., 2011). The Panel andstakeholders separated functions between scientists (knowledgeprovision) and stakeholders (planning and action) and communicatedclimate change uncertainties with coordination by the Mayor’s office(Rosenzweig et al., 2011).
Many nongovernment actors charged with managing climate risks use
community risk assessment tools to engage communities in risk reductionefforts and influence planning at district and sub-national levels (vanAalst, 2006; Twigg, 2007). NGO engagement in risk managementactivities ranges from demonstration projects, training and awareness-raising, legal assistance, alliance building, small-scale infrastructure,and socioeconomic projects, to mainstreaming and advocacy work (Luna,2001; Shaw, 2006). Bridging citizen-government gaps is a recognizedrole of civil society organizations and NGOs often act as social catalystsor social capital, an essential for risk management in cities (Wisner,
2003). Conversely, the potential benefits of social capital are not always
maximized due to mistrust, poor communications, or lack of functioning
either within municipalities or nongovernment agencies. This has major
implications for risk reduction (Wisner, 2003) and participation of themost vulnerable in nongovernment initiatives at municipal or sub-
national level is not guaranteed (Tanner et al., 2009).
This section highlighted mechanisms for building capacity for local
adaptation to climate extremes ranging from empowerment fordecisionmaking to utilization of social networks. A balanced portfolio of
approaches that capture local knowledge, proactive behaviors, andgovernmental and nongovernmental initiatives and practices will prove
most successful in managing the risk of climate extremes at the local
level. 5.5. Challenges and Opportunities
As illustrated earlier in the chapter, disaster risk management actionsincrease the coping capacity of local places to disasters in the shortterm and benefit a community’s resilience in the long term. Differencesin coping, risk management, and adaptation along with the costs of
managing disaster risk at the local level present challenges and
opportunities for adaptation to climate extremes. They not onlyinfluence human security, but the scale and context of the differenceshighlight opportunities for proactive actions for risk reduction andclimate change adaptation, and also identify constraints to suchactions.
5.5.1. Differences in Coping and Risk Management 
There are significant differences among localities and populationgroups in the ability to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adaptto disasters and climate extremes. During the last century, social scienceresearchers have examined those factors that influence coping responsesby households and local entities through post-disaster field investigationsas well as pre-disaster assessments (Mileti, 1999; NRC, 2006). Amongthe most significant individual characteristics are gender, age, wealth,ethnicity, livelihoods, entitlements, health, and settlements. However, itis not only these characteristics operating individually, but also theirsynergistic effects that give rise to variability in coping and managingrisks at the local level. 
5.5.1.1. Gender, Age, and Wealth
The literature suggests that at the local level gender makes a differencein vulnerability (Section 2.4) and in the differential mortality fromdisasters (Neumayer and Plümper, 2007). The evidence is robust with
high agreement . In disasters, women tend to have different coping
strategies and constraints on actions than men (Fothergill, 1996;Morrow and Enarson, 1996; Peacock et al., 1997). These are due tosocialized gender factors such as social position (class), marital status,education, wealth, and caregiver roles, as well as physical differences instature and endurance. At the local level for example, women’s lack ofmobility, access to resources, lack of power and legal protection, andsocial isolation found in many places across the globe tend to augmentdisaster risk, and vulnerability (Schroeder, 1987; IFRC, 1991; Mutton andHaque, 2004; UNIFEM, 2011). Relief and recovery operations are ofteninsensitive to gender issues (Hamilton and Halvorson, 2007), and so theprovision of such supplies and services also influences the differentialcapacities to cope (Enarson, 2000; Ariyabandu, 2006; Wachtendorf etal., 2006; Fulu, 2007), especially at the local level. However, the activeparticipation of women has been shown to increase the effectivenessof prevention, disaster relief, recovery, and reconstruction, therebyimproving disaster management (Enarson and Morrow, 1997, 1998;Fothergill, 1999, 2004; Hamilton and Halvorson, 2007; Enarson, 2010;see Box 5-5). Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level314Ageacts as an important factor in coping with disaster risk (Cherry, 2009).
Older people are more prone to ill health, isolation, disabilities, andimmobility (Dershem and Gzirishvili, 1999; Ngo, 2001), which negativelyinfluence their coping capacities in response to extreme events (seeCase Study 9.2.1). In North America, for example, retired people oftenchoose to live in hazardous locations such as Florida or Baja Californiabecause of warmer weather and lifestyles, which in turn increases theirpotential exposure to climate-sensitive hazards. Often because of hearingloss, mental capabilities, or mobility, older persons are less able to receivewarning messages or take protective actions, and are more reluctant toevacuate (O’Brien and Mileti, 1992; Hewitt, 1997). However, older peoplehave more experience and wisdom with accumulated know-how onspecific disasters/extreme events as well as the enhanced ability totransfer their coping strategies arising from life experiences.
Children have their own knowledge of hazards, hazardous places, and
vulnerability that is often different than adults (Plush, 2009; Gaillardand Pangilinan, 2010). Research has shown significant diminishment ofcoping skills (and increases in post-traumatic stress disorder and otherpsychosocial effects) among younger children following HurricaneKatrina (Barrett et al., 2008; Weems and Overstreet, 2008). In additionto physical impacts and safety (Lauten and Lietz, 2008; Weissbecker etal., 2008), research also suggests that emotional distress caused byfear of separation from the family, and increased workloads followingdisasters affects coping responses of children (Babugura, 2008; Ensor,2008). However, the research also suggests that children are quiteresilient and can adapt to environmental changes thereby enhancingthe adaptive capacity of households and communities (Bartlett, 2008;Manyena et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2008; Pfefferbaum et al., 2008;Ronan et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2008). 
Wealth , especially at the local level affects the ability of a households
or localities to prepare for, respond to, and rebound from disaster events(Cutter et al., 2003; Masozera et al., 2007). Wealthier places have agreater potential for large monetary losses, but at the same time, theyhave the resources (insurance, income, political cache) to cope with theimpacts and recover from extreme events, and they are less sociallyvulnerable. In Asia, for example, wealth shifted construction practices
from wood to masonry, which made many of the cities more vulnerableand less able to cope with disaster risk (Bankoff, 2007), especially inseismic regions. Poorer localities and populations often live in cheaper
hazard-prone locations, and face challenges not only in responding to
the event, but also recovering from it. Poverty also enhances disaster
risk (Carter et al., 2007). In some instances, it is neither the poor northe rich that face recovery challenges, but rather localities that are
in between, such as those not wealthy enough to cope with the
disaster risk on their own, but not poor enough to receive full federal or
international assistance.
In some localities, it is not just wealth or poverty that influence coping
strategies and disaster risk management, but rather the interactionbetween wealth, power, and status, that through time and across spacehas led to a complicated system of social stratification (Heinz Center,2002). One of the best examples of this is the human experience with
Hurricane Katrina (see Box 5-6).
5.5.1.2. Livelihoods and Entitlements
Adaptive capacity is influenced to a large extent by the institutionalrules and behavioral norms that govern individual responses to hazards(Dulal et al., 2010). It is also socially differentiated along the lines of age,ethnicity, class, religion, and gender (Adger et al., 2007). Local institutionsregulate the access to adaptation resources: those that ensure equitableopportunities for access to resources promote adaptive capacity withincommunities and other local entities (Jones et al., 2010). Institutions, aspurveyors of the rules of the game (North, 1990), mediate the sociallydifferential command over livelihood assets, thus determining protectionor loss of entitlements.
Livelihood is the generic term for all the capabilities, assets, and activities
required for a means of living. Livelihood influences how families andcommunities cope with and recover from stresses and shocks (Carney,1998). Another definition of livelihoods gives more emphasis to accessto assets and activities that is influenced by social relations (gender,class, kin, and belief systems) and institutions (Ellis, 2000). UnderstandingChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Box 5-5 | The Role of Women in Proactive
Behavior
Women’s involvement in running shelters and processing food
was crucial to the recovery of families and communities afterHurricane Mitch hit Honduras. One-third of the shelters wererun by women, and this figure rose to 42% in the capital. Themunicipality of La Masica in Honduras, with a mostly ruralpopulation of 24,336 people, stands out in the aftermath ofMitch because, unlike other municipalities in the northernAtlanta Department, it reported no mortality. Some attributedthis outcome to a process of community emergencypreparedness that began about six months prior to thedisaster. Gender lectures were given and, consequently, the
community decided that men and women should participateequally in all hazard management activities. When Mitchstruck, the municipality was prepared and vacated the areapromptly, thus avoiding deaths. Women participated actively inall relief operations. They went on rescue missions, rehabilitated
local infrastructure (such as schools), and along with men,distributed food. They also took over from men who hadabandoned the task of continuous monitoring of the earlywarning system. This case study illustrates the more generalfinding that the active incorporation of women into disasterpreparedness and response activities helps to ensure successin reducing the impacts of disasters (Buvinić et al., 1999;Cupples, 2007; Enarson, 2009).315how natural resource-dependent people cope with climate change in
the context of wider livelihood influences is critical to formulating validadaptation frameworks.
Local people’s livelihoods and their access to and control of resources
can be affected by events largely beyond their control such as climaticextremes (e.g., floods, droughts), conflict, or agricultural problems suchas pests and disease and economic shocks that can largely impact theirlivelihoods (Chambers and Conway, 1992; Jones et al., 2010). For poorcommunities living on fragile and degraded lands such as steep hillsides,dry lands, and floodplains, climate extremes present additional threatsto their livelihoods that could be lost completely if exposed to repeateddisastrous events within short intervals leaving insufficient time forrecovery. Actions aiming at improving local adaptive capacity focusmore on addressing the deteriorating environmental conditions. Acentral element in their adaptation strategies involves ecosystemmanagement and restoration activities such as watershed rehabilitation,agroecology, and forest landscape restoration (Ellis, 2000; Ellis andAllison, 2004; Osman-Elasha, 2006b). As some suggest (Spanger-Siegfriedet al., 2005) these types of interventions often protect and enhancenatural resources at the local scale and address immediate developmentpriorities, but can also improve local capacities to adapt to future
climate change. The buffering capacities of local people’s livelihoods
and their institutions are critical for their adaptation to extreme climate
stress. They often rest on the ability of communities to generatepotentials for self-organization and for social learning and innovations
(Adger et al., 2006).
A number of studies indicated that sustainable strategies for disaster
reduction help improve livelihoods (UNISDR, 2004), while social capital
and community networks support adaptation and disaster risk reductionby diminishing the need for emergency relief in times of droughtand/or crop failure (Devereux and Coll-Black, 2007; see Section 5.2.1).A research study in South Asia suggests that adaptive capacity andlivelihood resilience depend on social capital at the household level (i.e.,
education and other factors that enable individuals to function within awider economy), the presence or absence of local enabling institutions
(local cooperatives, banks, self-help groups), and the larger physical andsocial infrastructure that enables goods, information, services, and peopleto flow. Interventions to catalyze effective adaptation are important atall these multiple levels (Moench and Dixit, 2004). Diversification within
and beyond agriculture is a widely recognized strategy for reducing risk
and increasing well-being in many developing countries (Ellis, 2000;Ellis and Allison, 2004).
Entitlements are assets of the individuals and household. Assets are
broadly defined and include not only physical assets such as land, butalso human capital such as education and training. At the local scaleassets include institutional assets such as technical assistance or credit;social capital such as mutual assistance networks; public assets such asbasic infrastructure like water and sanitation; and environmental assetssuch as access to resources and ownership of them (Leach et al., 1999).The link between disaster risk, access to resources, and adaptation hasbeen widely documented in the literature (Sen, 1981; Adger, 2000;Brooks, 2003). Extreme climate events generally lead to entitlementdecline in terms of the rights and opportunities that local people haveto access and command the livelihood resources that enable them todeal with and adapt to climate stress. 
Assessment of livelihoods provides the explanation as to the differences
in responses based on the understanding of endowments, entitlements,and capabilities, within the organizational structure and power relationsof individuals, households, communities, and other local entities (Scoones,1998). Access to assets and entitlements is an important element inimproving the ability of localities to lessen their vulnerability and tocope with and respond to disasters and environmental change. In someinstances, this may not be true. For example, if a disaster affects ahousehold asset, but the household is still paying off its debt regardingthe initial cost of the asset and assuming that the asset is not protectedor insured against hazards, the asset loss coupled with the need to pay offthe loan renders the household more vulnerable, not less (Twigg, 2001).Entitlement protection thus requires adaptive types of institutions andChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Box 5-6 | Race, Class, Age, and Gender: Hurricane Katrina Recovery and Reconstruction
The intersection of race, class, age, and gender influenced differential decisionmaking; the uneven distribution of vulnerabili ty and
exposure; and variable access to post-event aid, recovery, and reconstruction in New Orleans before, during, and after Hurrican e Katrina
(Elliott and Pais, 2006; Hartman and Squires, 2006; Tierney, 2006). Evacuation can protect people from injury and death, but th ere are
inequalities in who can evacuate and when, with the elderly, poor, and minority residents least able to leave without assistanc e (Cutter
and Smith, 2009). Extended evacuations (or temporary displacements lasting weeks to months) produce negative effects. Prolongedperiods of evacuation can result in a number of physical and mental health problems (Curtis et al., 2007; Mills et al., 2007). Fu rthermore,
separation from family and community members and not knowing when a return home will be possible also adds to stress among evac uees
(Curtis et al., 2007). DeSalvo et al. (2007) found that long periods of displacement were among the key causes of post-traumatic  stress
disorder in a study of New Orleans workers. These temporary displacements can also lead to permanent outmigration by specific s ocial
groups as shown by the depopulation of New Orleans five years after Hurricane Katrina (Myers et al., 2008). In terms of longer-t erm
recovery, New Orleans is progressing, however large losses in population, housing, and employment suggest a pattern of only par tial
recovery for the city with significant differences in the location and the timing at the neighborhood or community level (Finch et al., 2010).316patterns of behavior (Meehl et al., 2007), with a focus on local people’s
agency within specific configurations of power relations. The challenge is,therefore, to empower the most vulnerable to pursue livelihood optionsthat strengthen their entitlements and protect what they themselvesconsider the social sources of adaptation and resilience in the face ofextreme climate stress. Better management of disaster risk alsomaximizes use of available resources for adapting to climate change(Kryspin-Watson et al., 2006).
5.5.1.3. Health and Disability 
The changes in extreme events and impacts of climate change influencethe morbidity and mortality of many populations now, and even moreso in the future (Campbell-Lendrum et al., 2003). The extreme impactsof climate change (see Sections 3.1.1 and 4.4.6) directly or indirectlyaffect the health of many populations and these will be felt first at thelocal level. Heat waves lead to heatstroke and cardiovascular disease,while shifts in air pollution concentrations such as ozone that oftenincrease with higher temperatures cause morbidity from other diseases(Bernard et al., 2001). Heat waves differentially affect populationsbased on their ethnicity, gender, age (Díaz et al., 2002), and medical andsocioeconomic status (O’Neill and Ebi, 2009), consequently raisingconcerns about health inequalities (see Case Study 9.2.1), especially atthe local scale. Health inequalities are of concern in extreme impacts ofclimate change more generally, as those with the least resources oftenhave the least ability to adapt, making the poor and disenfranchisedmost vulnerable to climate-related illnesses (McMichael et al., 2008).
For extreme events, pre-existing health conditions that characterize
vulnerable populations can exacerbate the impact of disaster eventssince these populations are more susceptible to additional injuries fromdisaster impacts (Brauer, 1999; Brown, 1999; Parati et al., 2001). Chronichealth conditions/disabilities can also lead to subsequent communicablediseases and illnesses in the short term, to lasting chronic illnesses, andto longer-term mental health conditions (Shoaf and Rottmann, 2000;Bourque et al., 2006; Few and Matthies, 2006). 
A range of vector-borne illnesses has been linked to climate, including
malaria, dengue, Hantavirus, Bluetongue, Ross River Virus, and cholera
(Patz et al., 2005). Cholera, for example, has seasonal variability that
may be directly affected by climate change (Koelle et al., 2004). Vector-
borne illnesses have been projected to increase in geographic reach andseverity as temperatures increase (McMichael et al., 2006), but thesechanges depend on a variety of human interventions like deforestation
and land use. The areas of habitation by mosquitoes and other vectors
are moving to areas previously free from such vectors of transmission
(Lafferty, 2009). Pools of standing water that are breeding grounds formosquitoes promise to expand, therefore increasing illness exposure(Depradine and Lovell, 2004; Meehl et al., 2007). At the same time, some
literature shows that illnesses like malaria are less prone to increase
than originally thought (Gething et al., 2010). Much of the nuance of
this literature is due to the location-specific nature of these outcomes.
Therefore, vector control programs will be best suited to the localcharacteristics of changing risks. Some programs, like those geared
toward surveillance, need common characteristics to support nationalprograms and also need to be coordinated across scales from local tonational and between local places. In addition, there are a variety ofsocial factors that have the potential to influence disease rates that aremost suitably managed at the sub-national level or urban scale. Forinstance, certain types of population growth or change may increaserisk and affect disease rates (Patz et al., 2005). Increased population andrelated land use changes can also increase disease rates. Vector controlprograms generally implemented at the local level also have the potentialto influence health outcomes (Tanser et al., 2003). Infectious diseasepatterns also have the potential to change dramatically, necessitatingimproved prevention on the part of local providers who have knowledgeof local environmental change (Parkinson and Butler, 2005). 
There is concern regarding the mental health impacts of storms and floods
that lead to destruction of livelihoods and displacement, especially forvulnerable populations (Balaban, 2006). In some hurricanes, the mentalhealth of residents in affected communities is extremely negativelyimpacted over an extended period of time (Weisler et al., 2006). Policyresponses to the event were insufficient to manage these impacts, andprovide a lesson for future events where greater mental health servicesmay be necessary (Lambrew and Shalala, 2006). Managing publichealth and disability is important in the response to disasters (Shoafand Rottmann, 2000).
Human health is at risk from many extreme events linked to climate
change. While resources from scales above the local are often necessary,the direction and application of those resources by local actors whoknow how to best apply them could make significant differences inhuman morbidity and mortality linked to climate extremes. 
5.5.1.4. Human Settlements
Settlement patterns are another factor that influences disaster riskmanagement and coping with extremes. Human settlements differ intheir physical and governance structures, population growth patterns,as well as in the types, drivers, impacts, and responses to disasters. Asnoted earlier (see Section 5.5.1.2), rural livelihoods and poverty aredrivers of disaster risk, but not the only ones. Poverty, resource scarcity,access to resources, as well as inaccessibility constrain disaster riskmanagement. When these are coupled with climate variability, conflict,and health issues they reduce the coping capacity of rural places(UNISDR, 2009). At the other extreme are the concentrated settlementsof towns and cities where the disaster risks are magnified because ofpopulation densities, poor living conditions including overcrowded andsubstandard housing, lack of sanitation and clean water, and healthimpairments from pollution and lack of adequate medical care (Bull-Kamanga et al., 2003; De Sherbinin et al., 2007). Strengthening localcapacity in terms of housing, infrastructure, and disaster preparednessis one mechanism shown to improve urban resilience and the adaptivecapacity of cities to climate-sensitive hazards (Pelling, 2003). It is alsoChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level317instructive to note how communities with differing capacities address
similar problems (Walker and Sydneysmith, 2008). 
One important locality receiving considerable research and policy attention
is megacities (see Case Study 9.2.8) due to the density of infrastructure,the population at risk, the growing number and location of informalsettlements, complex governance, and disaster risk management(Mitchell, 1999). Given the rapid rate of growth in the largest of theseworld’s cities and the increasing urbanization, the disaster risks willincrease in the next decade, placing more people in harm’s way withbillions of dollars in infrastructure located in highly exposed areas(Munich Re Group, 2004; Kraas et al., 2005; Wenzel et al., 2007).
For many regions, the ability to limit urban exposure has already been
achieved through building codes, land management, and disaster riskmitigation, yet losses keep increasing. For disaster reduction to becomemore effective, megacities will need to address their societal vulnerabilityand the driving forces that produce it (rural to urban migration,livelihood pattern changes, wealth inequities, informal settlements)(Wisner and Uitto, 2009). Many megacities are seriously compromisedin their ability to prepare for and respond to present disasters, let aloneadapt to future ones influenced by climate change (Fuchs, 2009;Heinrichs et al., 2009; Prasad et al., 2009).
However, it is not only the megacities that pose challenges, but the
overall growth in urban populations. Currently more than half of theglobal population lives in urban areas with an increasing populationexposed to multiple risk factors (UNFPA, 2009). Risk is increasing in urbanagglomerations of different size due to unplanned urbanization andaccelerated migration from rural areas or smaller cities (UN-HABITAT,2007). The 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction(UNISDR, 2009) lists unplanned urbanization and poor urban governanceas two main underlying factors accelerating disaster risk. It highlightedthat the increase in global urban growth of informal settlements in hazard-prone areas reached 900 million in informal settlements, increasing by25 million per year (UNISDR, 2009). Urban hazards exacerbate disaster riskby the lack of investment in infrastructure as well as poor environmentalmanagement, thus limiting the adaptive capacity of these areas. 
5.5.2. Costs of Managing Disaster Risk
and Risk from Climate Extremes
5.5.2.1. Costs of Impacts, Costs of Post-Event Responses
It is extremely difficult to assess the total cost of a large disaster, such
as Hurricane Katrina, especially at the local scale since most economicdata are only available at the national scale. Direct losses consist ofdirect market losses and direct non-market losses (intangible losses).
The latter include health impacts, loss of lives, natural asset damages
and ecosystem losses, and damages to historical and cultural assets.Indirect losses (also labeled higher-order losses (Rose, 2004) or hidden
costs (Heinz Center, 1999)) include all losses that are not provoked bythe disaster itself, but by its consequences. Measuring indirect losses is
important as it evaluates the overall economic impact of the disaster onsociety. Another difficulty with the measurement of economic lossesat the local level has to do with the boundary delineation for localanalyses. For example, local losses can be compensated from variousinflows of goods, workers, capital, and governmental or foreign aid fromoutside the affected area (Eisensee and Stromberg, 2007). Localdisasters also provide ripple effects and influence world markets, forinstance, oil prices in the case of Hurricane Katrina due to thetemporary shutdown of oil rigs. It is important to consider tradeoffs atdifferent spatial scales especially when estimating indirect losses at thelocal level. Disaster loss estimates are, therefore, highly dependent on thescale of the analysis, and result in wide variations among community,state, province, and sub-national regions.
Despite the difficulties in assessing local economic impact, several studies
exist. For example, Strobl (2008) provided an econometric analysis ofthe impact of the hurricane landfall on county-level economic growth inthe United States. This analysis showed that a county struck by at leastone hurricane over a year led to a decline in economic growth on averageby 0.79% and an increase by 0.22% the following year. The economicimpact of the 1993 Mississippi flooding in the United States showedsignificant spatial variability within the affected regions. In particular,states with a strong dependence on the agricultural sector had adisproportionate loss of wealth compared to states that had a morediversified economy (Hewings and Mahidhara, 1996). Noy and Vu (2010)investigated the impact of disasters on economic growth in Vietnam atthe provincial level, and found that fatal disasters decreased economicproduction while costly disasters increased short-term growth.Rodriguez-Oreggia et al. (2010) focused on poverty and the WorldBank’s Human Development Index at the municipality level in Mexico,and demonstrated that municipalities affected by disasters saw anincrease in poverty of 1.5 to 3.6%. Studies also found that regionalindirect losses increase nonlinearly with direct losses (Hallegatte, 2008),and can be compensated by importing the means for reconstruction(workers, equipment, finance) from outside the affected area. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2006) also provided a detailed
analysis of the labor market consequences of Hurricane Katrina withinLouisiana and found a marked economic and employment loss forLouisiana businesses, high unemployment rates immediately after thedisaster, and continued unemployment into 2006 for returning evacuees.At the household level, Smith and McCarty (2006) show that householdsare more often forced to move outside the affected area due toinfrastructure problems than due to structural damages to their home. 
Modeling approaches are also used to assess disaster indirect losses at
sub-national levels. These approaches include input-output models(Okuyama, 2004; Haimes et al., 2005; Hallegatte, 2008) and ComputableGeneral Equilibrium models (Rose et al., 1997; Rose and Liao, 2005;Tsuchiya et al., 2007). Most of the published analyses were carried outin developed countries. In the United States, West and Lenze (1994), forexample, discuss the merits of combining different impact models toChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level318triangulate, obtaining better primary data to reduce uncertainty, and
developing tools for estimating the impact of Hurricane Andrew onFlorida using reconstruction scenarios. The lack of research on disasterloss estimates in developing countries creates problems of underreportedeconomic losses or overestimation of disaster losses depending onpolitical or other interests. This is a big research gap.
5.5.2.2. Adaptation and Risk Management – Present and Future
Studies on the costs of local disaster risk management are scarce,fragmented, and conducted mostly in rural areas. One study estimated thebenefit/cost ratio of disaster management and preparedness programs inthe villages of Bihar and Andra Pradesh, India to be 3.76 and 13.38,
respectively (Venton and Venton, 2004), suggesting higher benefits than
costs. Research undertaken by the Institute for Social and EnvironmentalTransition on a number of cases in India, Nepal, and Pakistandemonstrated that benefits exceed the costs for local interventions(Dixit et al., 2008; Moench and Risk to Resilience Study Team, 2008).For example, they note that return rates are particularly robust forlower-cost interventions (e.g., raising house plinths and fodder storageunits, community-based early warning, establishing community grain orseed banks, and local maintenance of key drainage points), whencompared to embankment infrastructure strategies that require capitalinvestment (Moench and Risk to Resilience Study Team, 2008). Thestudies demonstrated a sharp difference in the effectiveness of the twoapproaches, concluding that the embankments historically have not hadan economically satisfactory performance in that study area. In contrast,the benefit/cost ratio for the local-level strategies indicated economicefficiency over time and for all climate change scenarios (Dixit et al.,2008). In developed countries, there are cost differences in adaptationstrategies between urban and rural areas. For example, in Japan disasterdamage is several hundred times more costly in urban than in ruralareas, necessitating different disaster risk management strategiesdepending on the benefit to cost analysis (Kazama et al., 2009).
Though disaster risk management and adaptation policies are closely
linked, few integrated cost analyses of risk management and adaptationare available at the local level. One example draws from recent studiesof the cost of city-scale adaptation. Rosenzweig et al. (2007, 2011)
developed a sophisticated analytical response to a projected fall in wateravailability in New York. This frames adaptation assessment within astep-wise decision analysis by identifying and quantifying impact risks
before identifying adaptation options that are then screened, evaluated,
and finally implemented. Another series of studies used simplified
catastrophe risk assessment to calculate the direct costs of storm surges
under scenarios of sea level rise coupled with an economic input-output
model for Copenhagen and Mumbai (Hallegatte et al., 2008a,b, 2011;
Ranger et al., 2011). The output is an assessment of the direct and indirecteconomic impacts of storm surge under climate change including
production, job losses, reconstruction time, and the benefits of investmentin upgraded coastal defenses. Results show that the consideration of
adaptation is an important element in the economic assessment ofextreme disaster risks related to climate change (Hallegatte et al.,
2011). Ranger et al. (2011) show that by improving the drainage systemin Mumbai, losses associated with a 1-in-100 year flood event could bereduced by as much as 70%. This means that the annual losses could bereduced in absolute terms compared with the current level, even withclimate change. Full insurance coverage of flooding could also cut theindirect cost by half. These analyses highlight the fact that adaptation to
extreme events and climate change can focus on reducing the directlosses (e.g., through the upgrade of coastal defenses) or indirect lossesby making the economy more robust, utilizing insurance schemes, orenacting public policies to support small businesses after the disaster. 
5.5.2.3. Consistency and Reliability of Cost and
Loss Estimations at the Local Level
There are inconsistencies in disaster-related economic loss data at all
levels – local, national, global – that ultimately influence the accuracyof such estimates (Guha-Sapir and Below, 2002; Downton and Pielke Jr.,2005; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008). The reliability of disaster economic lossestimates is especially problematic at the local level. First, the spatialcoverage and resolution of databases are global in coverage, but onlyhave data that represent the entire country, not sub-units within it suchas provinces, states, or counties. Second, thresholds for inclusion, whereonly large economically significant disasters are included, bias the datatoward singular events with large losses, rather than multiple, smallerevents with fewer losses. Third, what gets counted varies betweendatabases (e.g., insured versus uninsured losses; direct versus indirect; Gallet al., 2009). Moreover, disaster loss estimates have various purposesChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
FAQ 5.3 | Is it possible to estimate the cost
of risk management and adaptationat the local scale?
Studies on the costs of local disaster risk management are
scarce, fragmented, and conducted mostly in rural areas. Mosteconomic data (e.g., input-output table, income data) areavailable at the national scale. Moreover, there is a clear lack ofresearch on disaster estimates in developing countries, whichpresents a big gap in need of further research. In developedcountries, there are cost differences in adaptation strategiesbetween urban and rural areas. The reliability of disastereconomic loss estimates is especially problematic at the locallevel due to factors associated with the global nature ofspatial coverage and resolution. In addition there is someambiguity on impact and adaptation costs that affect local-level economic analyses, such as the lack of consensus onphysical impacts of climate change and adaptive capacity andon the evaluation of non-market costs (e.g., biodiversity orcultural heritage), which creates some uncertainty about localimpact and adaptation costs.319(e.g., assessment of foreign aid needs; cost-benefit analysis of protection
investments; World Bank, 2010). Depending on the purpose, spatial andconceptual gaps exist depending on the inclusion of loss-only data or acombination of loss and gain estimates as well as the calculation ofnon-market losses. 
Similarly, there is some ambiguity about impact and adaptation costs
that affect local-level economic analyses. The lack of consensus onphysical impacts of climate change and adaptive capacity (see Section4.5) is one issue. Another is the discount rate (Heal, 1997; Tol, 2003;Nordhaus, 2007; Stern, 2007; Weitzman, 2007) and the evaluation ofnon-market costs, especially the value of biodiversity or cultural heritage(Pearce and Moran, 1994), the latter contributing some uncertaintyabout local impact and adaptation costs. Finally, the possibility of low-probability high-consequence climate change is not fully included inmost analyses (Stern, 2007; Weitzman, 2007; Lonsdale et al., 2008;Nicholls et al., 2008). 
5.5.3. Limits to Local Adaptation
Local adaptation is set within larger spatial and temporal scales (Adgeret al., 2005), which influence the range of actors involved and the typesof potential barriers to the adaptation process (Moser and Ekstrom,2010; see Sections 6.3 and 7.6). At the local scale, limits and barriers tolocal adaptation generally fall into three interconnected categories:ecological and physical; human informational related to knowledge,technology, economics, and finances; and psychological, behavioral,and socio-cultural barriers (ICIMOD, 2009; Adger et al., 2010). The socialand cultural limits to adaptation are not well researched, with littleattention within the climate change literature devoted to this thus far.
Lack of access to information by local people has restricted improvements
in knowledge, understanding, and skills – needed elements in helpinglocalities undertake improved measures to protect themselves againstdisasters and climate change impacts (Agrawal et al., 2008). The
information gap is particularly evident in many developing countries withlimited capacity to collect, analyze, and use scientific data on mortalityand demographic trends as well as evolving environmental conditions(IDRC, 2002; Carraro et al., 2003; NRC, 2007). Based on Fischer et al.(2002), closing the information gap is critical to reducing climatechange-related threats to rural livelihoods and food security in Africa.
Lack of capacities and skills, particularly for women, also has been
identified as a limiting factor for effective local adaptation actions(Osman-Elasha et al., 2006). For example, localities in areas prone toclimate extremes such as frequent drought have developed certaincoping responses that assist them in surviving harsh conditions. Overtime, such coping responses proved inadequate due to the magnitude ofthe problem (Ziervogel et al., 2006). For example, in Mali, one initiativeinvolves empowering women and giving them the skills to diversifytheir livelihoods, thus linking environmental management, disasterrisk reduction, and the position of women as key resource managers(UNISDR and UNOCHA, 2008). 
In financial terms, microfinance services typically do not reach the
poorest and most vulnerable groups at local levels who have urgent andimmediate needs to be addressed (Amin et al., 2001; Helms, 2006). Theability of a community to ensure equitable access and entitlement to keyresources and assets is a key factor in building local adaptive capacity.
In developed countries, household decisions regarding disaster risk
reduction and adaptation are often guided by factors other than cost.For example, Kunreuther et al. (2009) found that most individualsunderestimate the risk and do not make cost-benefit tradeoffs in theirdecisions to purchase hazard insurance and/or have adequate coverage.They also found empirical evidence to suggest that the hazard insurancepurchase decision was driven not only by the need to protect assets, butalso to reduce anxiety, satisfy mortgage requirements, and socialnorms. For other types of disaster mitigation activities, households doChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
FAQ 5.4 | What are the limits to adaptation at the local level?
Traditionally, local risk management strategies focused only on short-term climatic events without considering the long-term tr ajectories
presented by a changing climate. Although reacting to climate extreme events and their impacts is important, it is more crucial  now to
focus on building the resilience of communities, cities, and sectors in order to ameliorate the impacts of future climatic chan ges. The
range and choice of actions that can be taken at the levels of individual or households are often event-specific and time-depen dent.
They are also constrained by location, adequate infrastructure, socioeconomic characteristics, and access to disaster risk info rmation. For
example, the increased urban vulnerability due to urbanization and rising population exacerbates disaster risk by the lack of i nvestment
in infrastructure as well as poor environmental management, and can have spillover effects to rural areas.
The obstacles to information transfer and communications are diverse, ranging from limitations in modeling the climate system t o
procedural, institutional, and cognitive barriers in receiving or understanding climatic information and advance warnings and t he capacity
and willingness of decisionmakers to modify action. Within many rural communities, low bandwidth and poor computing infrastruct ure
pose serious constraints to risk message receipt. Such gaps are evident in developed as well as lesser-developed regions. Const raints
exist in locally-organized collective action because of the difficulties of building effective coalitions with other organizati ons.320not voluntarily invest in cost-effective mitigation because of
underestimating the risk, taking a short-term rather than long-termview, and not learning from previous experience. However, they foundsocial norms significant: if homeowners in the neighborhood installedhurricane shutters, most would follow suit; the same was true ofpurchasing insurance (Kunreuther et al., 2009). For municipal govern ments,
adoption of building codes in hurricane-prone areas reduces damagesby US$ 108 per square meter for homes built from 1996 to 2004 in Florida(Kunreuther et al., 2009). However, enforcement of building codes bymunicipalities is highly variable and becomes a limiting factor in disasterrisk management and adaptation. 
Local-level adaptation actions in many cases are portrayed as reactive
and short term, unlike the higher-level national or regional plans that areconsidered anticipatory and involve formulation of policies and programs(Bohle, 2001; Burton et al., 2003). Poverty, increased urbanization, andextreme climate events limit the capacity to initiate planned livelihoodadaptations at the local scale. If extreme events happen more frequentlyor with greater intensity or magnitude some locations may beuninhabitable for lengthy and repeated periods, rendering sustainabledevelopment impossible. In such a situation, not all places will be ableto adapt without considerable disruption and costs (economic, social,cultural, and psychological). In some cases forced migration may be theonly alternative (Brown, 2008). 
As the above shows, the main challenge for local adaptation to climate
extremes is to find a good balance of measures that simultaneouslyaddress fundamental issues related to the enhancement of localcollective actions, and the creation of subsidiary structures at nationaland international scales that complement such local actions. Thismeans that the localized expression of the type, frequency, andextremeness of climate-sensitive hazards will be set within thesenational and international contexts.
5.5.4. Advancing Social and Environmental Justice
One of the key issues in examining outcomes of local strategies for
disaster risk management and climate change adaptation is the principleof fairness and equity. There is a burgeoning research literature on climatejustice looking at the differential impacts of adaptation policies
(Kasperson and Kasperson, 2001; Adger et al., 2006) at local, national,and global scales. The primary considerations at the local level are the
differential impacts of policies on communities, subpopulations, and
regions from present management actions (or inactions) (Thomas and
Twyman, 2005). There is also concern regarding the impact of presentmanagement (or inactions) in transferring the vulnerability of disaster risk
from one local place to another (spatial inequity) or from one generation
to another (intergenerational equity) (Cooper and McKenna, 2008).
There is less research on the mechanisms or practical actions needed for
advancing social and environmental justice at the local scale, independentof the larger issues of accountability and governance at all scales. This
is an important gap in the literature. 5.6. Management Strategies
5.6.1. Basics of Planning in a Changing Climate
Prior to the development and implementation of management strategiesand adaptation alternatives, local entities need baseline assessments ondisaster risk and the potential impacts of climate extremes. The assessmentof local disaster risk includes three distinct elements: 1) exposure
hazard assessment, or the identification of hazards and their potentialmagnitudes/severities as they relate to specific local places (see
below); 2) vulnerability assessments that identify the sensitivity of thepopulation to such exposures and the capacity of the population to copewith and recover from them (see below and Sections 2.6.2 and 4.4); and3) damage assessments that determine direct and indirect lossesfrom particular events (either ex-post in real events or ex-ante throughmodeling of hypothetical events) (described in Section 5.5.2; seeSection 4.5.1). Each of these plays a part in understanding the hazardvulnerability of a particular locale or characterizing not only who is at riskbut also the driving forces behind the differences in disaster vulnerabilitiesin local places. 
There are numerous examples of exposure and vulnerability assessment
methodologies and metrics (Birkmann, 2006; see Chapter 2). Of particularnote are those studies focused on assessing the sub-national exposureto coastal hazards (Gornitz et al., 1994; Hammar-Klose and Thieler, 2001),drought (Wilhelmi and Wiilhite, 2002; Alcamo et al., 2008; Kallis, 2008),or multiple hazards such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency’smulti-hazard assessment for the United States (FEMA, 1997). 
Vulnerability assessments highlight the interactive nature of disaster risk
exposure and societal vulnerability. While many of them are qualitativelybased (Bankoff et al., 2004; Birkmann, 2006), there is an emergentliterature on quantitative metrics in the form of vulnerability indices. Themost prevalent vulnerability indices, however, are national in scale(SOPAC and UNEP , 2005; Cardona, 2007) and compare countries to oneanother, not places at sub-national geographies. The exceptions are theempirically-based Social Vulnerability Index (Cutter et al., 2003) andextensions of it (Fekete, 2009).
Vulnerability assessments are normally hazard-specific and many have
focused on climate-sensitive threats such as extreme storms in Revere,Massachusetts (Clark et al., 1998), sea level rise in Cape May, NewJersey (Wu et al., 2002), or flooding in Germany (Fekete, 2009) and theUnited States (Burton and Cutter, 2008; Zahran et al., 2008). Researchfocused on multi-hazard impact assessments ranges from locally basedcounty-level assessments for all hazards (Cutter et al., 2000) to sub-national studies such as those involving all hazards for Barbados andSt. Vincent (Boruff and Cutter, 2007) to those involving a smaller subsetof climate-related threats (O’Brien et al., 2004; Brenkert and Malone,2005; Alcamo et al., 2008). The intersection of local exposure to climate-sensitive hazards and social vulnerability was recently assessed for thenortheast (Cox et al., 2007) and southern region of the United States(Oxfam, 2009). Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level321However, the full integration of hazard exposure and social vulnerability
into a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for the local area or regionof concern is often lacking for many places. Part of this is a function ofthe bifurcation of the science inputs (e.g., natural scientists providemost of the relevant data and models for exposure assessments whilesocial scientists provide the inputs for the populations at risk). It alsorelates to the difficulties of working across disciplinary or knowledgeboundaries.
The development of methodologies and metrics for climate adaptation
assessments is emerging and mostly derivative of the methodologiesemployed in vulnerability assessments noted above. For example, someare extensions or modifications of community vulnerability assessmentmethodologies and employ community participatory approaches suchas those used by World Vision (Greene, n.d.), the Red Cross (van Aalst etal., 2008), and others. Still others begin with livelihood or risk assessmentframeworks and use a wide range of techniques including multi-criteriadecision analyses (Eakin and Bojorquez-Tapia, 2008); index construction(Vescovi et al., 2009); segmentation and regional to global comparisons(Torresan et al., 2008); and scenarios (Wilby et al., 2009).
5.6.2. Community-Based Adaptation
Community-based adaptation (CBA) empowers communities to decidehow they want to prepare for climate risks and coordinate communityaction to achieve adaptation to climate change (Ebi, 2008). Part of thisentails community risk assessment for climate change adaptation thatassesses the hazards, vulnerabilities, and capacities of the community(van Aalst et al., 2008), which has also been called community-baseddisaster preparedness among other names. The intention is to fosteractive participation in collecting information that is rooted in thecommunities and enables affected people to participate in their ownassessment of risk and identify responses than can enhance resilienceby strengthening social-institutional measures including social relations(Allen, 2006; Patiño and Gauthier, 2009). In assessing short- and long-term risks, the needs of vulnerable groups are often excluded (Douglaset al., 2009). The tools for engaging vulnerable groups in the processinclude transect walks and risk maps that capture the climate-related
hazards and risks and storylines about possible future climate changeimpacts (Ebi, 2008; van Aalst et al., 2008; Patiño and Gauthier, 2009),although these tools often require input from participants external to
the community who have long-term climate information. 
The challenges in using community-based adaptation approaches
include the challenge of scaling up information (Burton et al., 2007), the
fact that it is resource-intensive (van Aalst et al., 2008), and recognizingthat disempowerment occurs when local stories are distorted or not
valued sufficiently (Allen, 2006). The integration of climate change
information increases this challenge as it introduces an additional layer
of uncertainty and may conflict with the principle of keeping CBA simple.There is little evidence that secondary data on climate change has
been used in CBA, partly because of the challenge of limited access todownscaled climate change scenarios relevant at the local level (Ziervogel
and Zermoglio, 2009) and because of the uncertainty of projections. 
Examples of community-based approaches illustrate some of the
processes involved. In northern Bangladesh, a flooding adaptation projecthelped to establish early warning committees within villages that linkedto organizations outside the community, with which they did not usuallyinteract and that had historically blocked collective action and resourcedistribution (Ensor and Berger, 2009). Through this revised governancestructure, the building of small roads, digging culverts, and plantingtrees to alleviate flood impacts was facilitated. In Portland, Oregon,another project involved a range of actors to reduce the impact of urbanheat islands through engaging neighborhoods and linking them toexperts to install green roofs, urban vegetation, and fountains that ledto an increased sense of ownership in the improvements (Ebi, 2008). Inthe Philippines, the community-based approach enabled a deeperunderstanding of locally specific vulnerability than in previous disastermanagement contexts (Allen, 2006). While individually important, thesecommunity-based approaches should be viewed as part of a widersystem that recognizes the drivers at multiple scales, including themunicipalities and national levels. 
CBA responses provide increased participation and recognition of the
local context, which is important when adapting to climate change (seeBox 5-7). The need for coordinated collective action was seen inKampala, where land cover change and changing climate are increasingthe frequency and severity of urban flooding and existing responseactivities are uncoordinated and consist of clearing drainage channels(Douglas et al., 2009). However, residents felt more could be done toadapt to frequent flooding, including increasing awareness of roles andresponsibilities in averting floods, improving the drainage system,improving garbage and solid waste disposal, strengthening the buildinginspection unit, and enforcing bylaws on the construction of houses andsanitation facilities. Similarly, in Accra, residents felt that municipal lawson planning and urban design need to be enforced, suggesting thatstrong links are needed between community responses and municipalresponses (Douglas et al., 2009). 
5.6.3. Risk Sharing and Transfer at the Local Level
Risk transfer and risk sharing are pre-disaster financing arrangementsthat shift economic risk from one party to another and are more fullydiscussed in Chapter 2, Section 7.4.4, and Case Study 9.2.13. Informalrisk sharing practices are common and important for post-disaster reliefand reconstruction. In the absence of more formal mechanisms likeinsurance, those incurring losses may employ diverse non-insurancefinancial coping strategies, such as relying on the solidarity of internationalaid, remittances, selling and pawning fungible assets, and borrowing frommoneylenders. Traditional livestock loans are one example (Oba, 2001).At-risk individuals in low-income countries rely extensively on reciprocalexchange, kinship ties, and community self-help. For example, women inhigh-risk areas often engage in innovative ways to access post-disasterChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level322capital by joining informal risk-hedging schemes, becoming clients of
multiple microfinance institutions, or maintaining reciprocal socialrelationships. Combined analysis of multiple surveys suggests thatabout 40% of households in low- and lower-middle income countriesare involved in private transfers in a given year as recipients or donors(Davies and Leavy, 2007).
Households in disaster-prone slum areas in El Salvador spend an average
of 9.2% of their yearly income on risk management, including financing
emergency relief and recovery (Wamsler, 2007). A particularly importantinformal risk-sharing mechanism is remittances, or transfers of money from
foreign workers to their home countries (discussed further in Section
7.4.4). Household savings can be accessed from a bank, but they can alsobe in the form of stockpiles of food, grains, seeds, and fungible assets.
Small savings institutions can be directly impacted by catastrophes, whichcan result in insufficient liquidity to handle a run on their accounts, as
occurred during the 1998 floods in Bangladesh (Kull, 2006). Lacking
sufficient savings, many disaster victims take out loans to cover their post-disaster expenses. The interest rate (18-60%) charged on formal micro-
credit, while relatively high, generally is far below the rate (120-300%)charged by local moneylenders (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2009).
Insurance, including micro-insurance, is the most common formal risk
transfer mechanism at the local level. An insurance contract spreadsstochastic losses geographically and temporally, and can assure timely
liquidity for the recovery and reconstruction process. As such, it is aneffective disaster risk reduction tool especially when combined withother risk management measures. For example, in most industrializedcountries, insurance is utilized in combination with early warning systems,risk information, disaster preparation, and disaster mitigation. Whereinsurance is applied without adequate risk reduction, it can be adisincentive for adaptation, as individuals may rely on insurance tomanage their risks and are left overly exposed to impacts (Rao andHess, 2009; see Section 5.4.1). Furthermore, insurance can provide thenecessary financial security to take on productive but risky investments(Höppe and Guren ko, 2006). Examples include a pilot project in Malawi
where micro-insurance is bundled with loans that enable farmers to accessagricultural inputs that increase their productivity (Hess and Syroka, 2005),
and a project in Mongolia that protects herders’ livestock from extremewinter weather to reduce livestock losses (Skees et al., 2008).
Micro-insurance is a financial arrangement to protect low-income people
against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payments(Churchill, 2006, 2007). Several pilot projects have yielded promisingoutcomes, yet experience is too short to judge if micro-insurance schemesare viable in the long run for local places. Many of the ongoing micro-insurance initiatives are index-based – a relatively new approach wherebythe insurance contract is not against the loss itself, but against an eventChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level
Box 5-7 | Taking Collective Action to Improve Livelihoods Strategies: Small-Scale Farmers
Adapting to Climate Change in Northern Cape, South Africa
The Northern Cape Province, South Africa, is a harsh landscape, with frequent and severe droughts and extreme conditions for th e people,
animals, and plants living there. This has long had a negative impact on small-scale rooibos farmers living in some of the more  marginal
production areas. Rooibos is an indigenous crop that is well adapted to the prevailing hot, dry summer conditions, but is sensi tive to
prolonged drought. Rooibos tea has become well-accepted on world markets, but this success has brought little improvement tomarginalized small-scale producers.
In 2001, a small group of farmers decided to take collaborative action to improve their livelihoods and founded the Heiveld Co- operative
Ltd. Initially established as a trading cooperative to help the farmers produce and market their tea jointly, it subsequently b ecame
apparent that the local organization was also an important vehicle for social change in the wider community (Oettlé et al., 2004 ). The
Heiveld became a repository and source of local and scientific knowledge related to sustainable rooibos production. Following a  severe
drought (2003-2005) and a perceived increase in weather variability, the Heiveld farmers decided to monitor the local climate a nd to
discuss seasonal forecasts and possible strategies in quarterly climate change preparedness workshops. These workshops are faci litated
in collaboration with two local NGOs (Indigo and Environmental Monitoring Group). They are also supported by scientists to addr ess
farmers’ questions in a participatory action research approach – to ensure that local knowledge and scientific input can be com bined to
increase the resilience of local livelihoods. The Heiveld Co-operative has been an important organizational vehicle for this le arning
process, strongly supported by their long-term partners, with the focus on supporting the development of possible adaptation st rategies
through a joint learning approach to respond to and prepare for climate variability and change. 
The extension of social, participatory, and organizational learning to climate change adaptation illustrated in this case study  emphasizes
the significance of identifiable climate change signals, informal networks, and boundary organizations to enhance the preparati on of
people and organizations for the changing climate (Berkhout et al., 2006; Pelling et al., 2008). Participatory learning is especi ally
emphasized (Berkhout, 2002; A. Shaw et al., 2009; R. Shaw et al., 2009). Focusing on what can be learned from managing currentclimate risk is a good starting point, particularly for poor and marginalized communities (Someshwar, 2008).323that causes loss, such as insufficient rainfall during critical stages of
plant growth (Turvey, 2001). Weather index insurance is largely at apilot stage, with several projects operating around the globe, includingin Mongolia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, and Tanzania (Hellmuth et al.,2009). Index insurance for agriculture is more developed in India, wherethe Agricultural Insurance Company of India has extended coverageagainst inadequate rainfall to 700,000 farmers (Hellmuth et al., 2009).
Index-based contracts as an alternative to traditional crop insurance
have the advantages of greatly limiting transaction costs (from reducedclaims handling) and in improving emergency response (Chantarat et al.,2007). A disadvantage is the potential of a mismatch between yield andpayout, a critical issue given the current lack of density of meteorologicalstations in vulnerable regions – a challenge remote sensing may helpaddress (Skees and Barnett, 2006). Participants’ understanding of howinsurance operates, as well as their trust in the product and thestakeholders involved, may also be a problem for scaling up indexinsurance pilots, although simulation games and other innovativecommunication approaches are yielding promising results (Patt et al.,2009). Affordability can also be a problem. Disasters can affect wholecommunities or regions (co-variant risks), and because of this insurersmust be prepared for meeting large claims all at once, with the cost ofrequisite backup capital potentially raising the premium far above theclient’s expected losses – or budget. While valuable in reducing thelong-term effects on poverty and development, insurance instruments,particularly if left entirely to the market, are not appropriate in allcontexts (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2010).
The insurance industry itself is vulnerable to climate change. The
continuing exit of private insurers in some market areas is seen with theincreasingly catastrophic local losses in the United States (Lecomte andGahagan, 1998), United Kingdom (Priest et al., 2005), and Germany(Thieken et al., 2006; Botzen and van den Bergh, 2008), which in turnreduces disaster management options at the sub-national scale. Climatechange could be particularly problematic for this sector at the localscale (Vellinga et al., 2001), including the probable maximum loss andpressures from regulators responding to changing prices and coverage(Kunreuther et al., 2009). 
One response to rising levels and volatility of risk has been to increase
insurance and reinsurance capacity through new alternative risk transferinstruments, such as index-linked securities (including catastrophe bondsand weather derivatives) (Vellinga et al., 2001). These tools could play
an increasingly important role in a new era of elevated catastrophe risks
(Kunreuther et al., 2009). Another approach is to reduce risks throughsocietal adaptation (Herweijer et al., 2009), and risk communication andfinancial incentives from insurers (Ward et al., 2008). For example,Lloyds of London (2008) demonstrated that in exposed coastal regions,
increases in average annual losses and extreme losses due to sea level
rise in 2030 could be offset through investing in property-levelresilience to flooding or sea walls. Similarly, RMS (2009) shows that
wind-related losses in Florida could be significantly reduced through
strengthening buildings. Risk transfer is broader than shifting the economic burden from one
party to another. It also entails the transfer of risks from one generation(intergenerational equity) to the next. Risk transfer also has a spatialelement in shifting the risk burdens from one geographic location toanother. Both of these larger transfer mechanisms are significant fordisaster risk management and climate change adaptation at the localscale, but more research is required to assess the localized effects.Spatial and intergenerational equity are considered in Chapter 8.
5.6.4. A Transformative Framework
for Management Strategies
Management strategies need to consider adaptation as a process rather
than measures and actions for a particular event or time period. Experiencein planning and implementing adaptation to climate change as well asdisaster response reveals that socio-institutional processes are importantin bringing together a set of intertwined elements (Tschakert and Dietrich,2010; see Chapter 8). O’Brien et al. (2011) suggest an adaptationcontinuum (see Figure 5-2), where the goal is to move toward partnershipsthat enable social transformations and increased resilience.
A key component of the disaster risk management and adaptation
process is the ability to learn (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007; Armitage et al.,2008; Lonsdale et al., 2008). This focus on learning partly derives from thefields of social-ecological resilience and sustainability science (Berkes,2009; Kristjanson et al., 2009). As scenarios combine quantitativeindicators of climate, demographic, biophysical, and economic change,as well as qualitative storylines of socio-cultural changes at the locallevel, the participation of local stakeholders is essential to generatevalues and understandings of climate extremes. 
Adaptation is a process rather than an endpoint and requires a focus on
the institutions and policies that enable or hinder this process(Inderberg and Eikeland, 2009) as well as the acknowledgement that
there are often competing stakeholder goals (Ziervogel and Ericksen,
2010). Fostering better adaptive capacity for disaster and climate risk
will help to accelerate future adaptation (Inderberg and Eikeland, 2009;Moser, 2009; Patt, 2009). However, there are barriers, including lack ofcoordination between actors, the complexity of the policy field(Mukheibir and Ziervogel, 2007; Winsvold et al., 2009), and limitedhuman capacity to implement policies (Ziervogel et al., 2010). Lastly,individual, sector, and institutional perceptions of risk and adaptivecapacity can determine whether adaptation responses are initiated ornot (Grothmann and Patt, 2005). 
5.7. Information, Data, and Research Gaps
at the Local Level
The causal processes by which disasters produce systemic effects over
time and across space is reasonably well-known (Kreps, 1985; Cutter,1996; Lindell and Prater, 2003; NRC, 2006). Yet, local emergencyChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level324management communities have by and large paid little attention to the
links between climate change and natural hazards (Bullock et al., 2009).As a result, state and local disaster mitigation plans, even when requiredby law, usually fail to include climate change, sea level rise, or climateextreme events in hazard assessments or do so in entirely deterministicways. Decisions about development, hazard mitigation, and emergency
preparedness in the context of climate change give rise to critical
questions about social and economic adaptation, and the informationand data to support it, especially at the local scale (Mileti, 1999; Cutter,
2001; Mileti and Peek, 2002). For example: How do cumulative impacts
of smaller events over time compare to single high-impact events for
localities? Do increased levels of hazard mitigation and disasterpreparedness increase local risk-taking by individuals and social systems?How do short-term adjustments or coping strategies enable or constrainlong-term vulnerabilities in localities? What are the tradeoffs among
decision acceptability versus decision quality, especially within local
contexts (Comfort et al., 1999; Travis, 2010)?
For many of these questions, sufficient empirical information is lacking,
especially at the sub-national scale (see also Section 5.4.2.3). Two recentall-hazards studies for the United States found that from 1970 to 2004,climate-sensitive hazards accounted for the majority of recorded fatalities
from natural hazards (Borden and Cutter, 2008; Thacker et al., 2008). Yet,these are the only databases for monitoring mortality from natural hazardsat the local level and suffer from lack of consistency and completeness. 
The hurricane recovery process includes ample evidence of how efforts
to ensure that the rush to return to normal have also led to depletion ofnatural resources and increased risk. How decisions regarding the rightto migrate (even temporarily), the right to organize, and the right ofaccess to information are made will, as a result, have major implicationsfor the ability of different groups to adapt successfully to floods, droughts,and storms. The idea of linking place-based recovery, preparedness, andresilience to adaptation is intuitively appealing. However, the constituencythat supports improved disaster risk management has historically proventoo small to bring about many of the changes that have beenrecommended by researchers, especially those that focus on strengtheningthe social fabric to decrease vulnerability. Behind the specific questionsof the transparency of risk, are broader questions about the publicsphere. What public goods will be provided by governments at all levels(and how will they be funded), what public goods will be provided byprivate or organizations in civil society, what will be provided byChapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level

Figure 5-2 | Learning and transformation. Throughout the adaptation process, learning is expected to increase along with institutional chang e leading to the potential for
paradigmatic transformation – the community moves away from an impact-focus perspective to a resilience-centric one where there  is an expectation of risk and where good
governance and key partnerships are the norm. Source: adapted from O’Brien et al., 2011.325market actors, and what will not? How will these influence local-level
disaster risk management, especially of climate-sensitive hazards(Mitchell, 1988, 1999; Thomalla et al., 2006; van Aalst et al., 2008)?
While there has been increasing focus on the processes by which
knowledge has been produced, less time has been spent examining thecapacity of local communities to critically assess knowledge claimsmade by others for their reliability and relevance to those communities(Fischhoff, 2007; Pulwarty, 2007). There is the need to move beyond theintegration of physical and societal impacts to focus on practice andevaluation. How are impediments to the flow of information created? Isa focus on communication adequate to ensure effective response? Howare these nodes defined among differentially vulnerable groups, forexample, based on economic class, race, or gender? However, there islittle research on the extent to which local jurisdictions have adoptedpolicy options and practice and the ways in which they are beingimplemented. Most of the studies to date have addressed factors thatlead to policy adoption and not necessarily successful implementation.
Beyond infrastructure and retrofitting concerns, successful adaptation
strategies integrate urban planning, water management, early warningsystems, and preparedness. One widely acknowledged goal is to address,directly, the problem of an inadequate fit between what the researchcommunity knows about the physical and social dimensions of uncertainenvironmental hazards and what society chooses to do with thatknowledge. An even larger challenge is to consider how differentsystems of knowledge about the physical environment and competingsystems of action can be brought together in pursuit of diverse goalsthat we wish to pursue (Mitchell, 2003). Several sources (Comfort et al.,1999; Bullock et al., 2009; McKinsey Group, 2009) have identified keyresearch and data requirements for addressing these challenges:
1)Multi-way information exchange systems – effective adaptation willalways be locally driven. Communities need reliable measurementsand assessment tools, integrated information about risks that thosetools reveal, and best approaches to minimize those risks. The goal isto improve the assessment and transparency of risk in a geographicplace-based approach for vulnerable regions. Improving the collectionand quality control of locally based data on economic losses, disasterand adaptation costs, and human losses (fatalities) will ensure
improved empirically based baseline assessments.
2)Maps of the decision processes for disaster mitigation, preparedness,
response, and recovery and guidance for using such decision supporttools are needed. Hazard maps developed through collaborationbetween researchers and affected communities are the simplest
and often most powerful form of risk information. They capture the
likelihood and impact of a peril and are important for informing
many aspects of disaster risk management including disaster riskreduction, risk-based pooling of resources, and risk transfer. Such
devices would identify segments of threatened social systems that
could suffer disproportionate disaster impacts; critical actors at eachjurisdictional level; their risk assumptions; their different types of
information needs; and the design of an information infrastructure
that would support decisions at critical entry points (Comfort, 1993).3)People who face hazards often need assistance to manage theirown environments over the long term and develop systematicactions to improve resilience in vulnerable localities. Research isneeded on how local governments and institutions can support,provide incentives, and legitimize successful approaches toincreasing capacity and action.
4)Methodologies, indicators, and measurement of progress in reducingvulnerability and enhancing community capacity at the local levelare under-researched at present. Locally based risk management,cost-effectiveness methodologies and analyses, quantification ofsocietal impacts of catastrophic events at local to national scales,and research on implementation and evaluation of risk managementand mitigation programs are needed. Similarly, there is a criticalneed for the assessment and coordination of multi-jurisdictionaland multi-sectoral efforts to help avoid the unintended consequencesof actions and interventions especially at the local scale. 
5)Underserved people require access to the social and economicsecurity that comes from sharing risk, through financial risk transfermechanisms such as insurance. There is a paucity of studies at thelocal level to assess the efficacy of alternative risk reduction, risk-based resource pooling and transfer methods, analysis of benefitsand costs to various stakeholder groups, analysis of complementaryroles of mitigation and insurance, and analysis of safeguardsagainst insurance industry insolvency.
Interdisciplinary collaboration is clearly needed to prioritize and address
these research needs. Situating the scientific understanding of hazards,disaster risk, and climate change adaptation within a broader discourseabout different forms of knowledge will increase the likelihood of publicactions that are better grounded in scientific knowledge and customizedfor the local context.
5.8. Summary
This chapter presented evidence on how climate extremes affect localplaces; how local places currently cope with disasters such as emergencyassistance and disaster relief; and how they anticipate and plan for futuredisaster risk using improved communication, structures such as dams andlevees, land use management and ecosystem protection, and storage ofresources. The role of scale and context shapes variability in buildingadaptive capacity at the local level. Differences in coping and riskmanagement also are scale-dependent and context-specific, and couldaffect or limit adaptations to climate extremes at the local level. Lastly,climate extremes threaten human security at the local level. Localizedvulnerability attributed to social, economic, environmental, and climatechange drivers at a variety of scales heightens the impacts of climateextremes on local places. While some places have considerable experiencewith disasters and some inherent capacity to cope with climate extremes,others do not. These differences in coping and management necessitatea range of approaches for disaster risk management and climate changeadaptation, thus attention to a broader set of national and internationalcontexts relating to social welfare, quality of life, and sustainable livelihoods.Chapter 5 Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes at the Local Level326References

Table of Contents341This chapter assesses how countries are managing current and projected disaster risks, given knowledge of how risks
are changing with observations and projections of weather and climate extremes [Table 3-2, 3.3], vulnerability andexposure [4.3], and impacts [4.4]. It focuses on the design of national systems for managing such risks, the rolesplayed by actors involved in the system, and the functions they perform, acknowledging that complementary actions
to manage risks are also taken at local and international level as described in Chapters 5 and 7. 
National systems are at the core of countries’ capacity to meet the challenges of observed and projected
trends in exposure, vulnerability, and weather and climate extremes ( high agreement, robust evidence ).
Effective national systems comprise multiple actors from national and sub-national governments, private sector,research bodies, and civil society, including community-based organizations, playing differential but complementaryroles to manage risk according to their accepted functions and capacities. These actors work in partnership acrosstemporal, spatial, administrative, and social scales, supported by relevant scientific and traditional knowledge. Specificcharacteristics of national systems vary between countries and across scales depending on their socio-cultural, political,and administrative environments and development status. [6.2]
The national level plays a key role in governing and managing disaster risks because national government
is central to providing risk management-related public goods as it commonly maintains financial andorganizational authority in planning and implementing these goods ( high agreement, robust evidence ).
National governments are charged with the provision of public goods such as ensuring the economic and social well-being, safety, and security of their citizens from disasters, including the protection of the poorest and most vulnerablecitizens. They also control budgetary allocations as well as creating legislative frameworks to guide actions by otheractors. Often, national governments are considered to be the ‘insurer of last resort’. In line with the delivery of publicgoods, national governments and public authorities ‘own’ a large part of current and future disaster risks (publicinfrastructure, public assets, and relief spending). In terms of managing risk, national governments act as riskaggregators and by pooling risk, hold a large portfolio of public liabilities. This provides governments responsibility toaccurately quantify and manage risks associated with this portfolio – functions that are expected to become moreimportant given projected impacts of climate change and trends in vulnerability and exposure. [6.2.1]
In providing such public goods, governments choose to manage disaster risk by enabling national systems
to guide and support stakeholders to reduce risk where possible, transfer risk where feasible, and manageresidual risk, recognizing that risks can never be totally eliminated (high agreement, robust evidence). The
balance between reducing risk and other disaster risk management strategies is influenced by a range of factors,including financial and technical capacity of stakeholders, robustness of risk assessment information, and culturalelements involving risk tolerance. [6.2.1, 6.2-6.5]
The ability of governments to implement disaster risk management responsibilities differs significantly
across countries, depending on their capacity and resource constraints (high agreement, robust evidence ).
Smaller or economically less-diversified countries face particular challenges in providing the public goods associated
with disaster risk management, in absorbing the losses caused by climate extremes and disasters, and in providingrelief and reconstruction assistance. [6.4.3] However, there is limited evidence to suggest any correlation between the
type of governance system in a country (e.g., centralized or decentralized; unitary or federal) and the effectiveness of
disaster risk management efforts. There is robust evidence and high agreement to suggest that actions generated
within and managed by communities with supporting government policies are generally most effective since they are
specific and tailored to local environments. [6.4.2]
In the majority of countries, national systems have been strengthened by applying the principles of the
Hyogo Framework for Action to mainstream risk considerations across society and sectors, although
greater efforts are required to address the underlying drivers of risk and generate the political will toinvest in disaster risk reduction (high agreement, robust evidence). The Hyogo Framework for Action hasChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
Executive Summary342encouraged countries to develop and implement a systematic disaster risk management approach, and in some cases
has led to strategic shifts in the management of disaster risks, with governments and other actors placing greaterattention on disaster risk reduction compared to more reactive measure s. This has included improvements in coordina tion
between actors, enhanced early warning and preparedness, more rigorous risk assessments, and increased awareness.
However, there is limited evidence and low agreement to suggest improvements in integration between efforts to
implement the Hyogo Framework for Action, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, andbroader development and environmental policy frameworks. [6.4.2]
A set of factors can be identified that make efforts to systematically manage current disaster risks more successful (all
high agreement, robust evidence ). Systems to manage current disaster risk are more successful if:
•Risks are recognized as dynamic and are mainstreamed and integrated into development policies, strategies, and
actions, and into environmental management. [6.3.1]
•Legislation for managing disaster risks is supported by clear regulations that are effectively enforced acrossscales and complemented by other sectoral development and management legislations where risk considerationsare explicitly integrated. [6.4.1]
•Disaster risk management functions are coordinated across sectors and scales and led by organizations at thehighest political level. [6.4.2]
•They include considerations of disaster risk in national development and sector plans, and, if they adopt climatechange adaptation strategies, translating these plans and strategies into actions targeting vulnerable areas andgroups. [6.5.2]
•Risk is quantified and factored into national budgetary processes, and a range of measures including budgeting forrelief expenditure, reserve funds, and other forms of risk financing have been considered or implemented. [6.4.3]
•Decisions are informed by comprehensive information about observed changes in weather, climat e, and vulnera bility
and exposure, and historic disaster losses, using a diversity of readily available tools and guidelines. [6.5.1]
•Early warning systems deliver timely, relevant, and accurate predictions of hazards, and are developed and madeoperational in partnership with the public and trigger effective response actions. [6.5.1]
•Strategies include a combination of hard infrastructure-based options responses and soft solutions such asindividual and institutional capacity building and ecosystem-based responses, including conservation measuresassociated with, for example, forestry, river catchments, coastal wetlands, and biodiversity. [6.5.2]
While there is robust evidence and high agreement on efforts to tackle current disaster risks, the assessment
found limited evidence of national disaster risk management systems and associated risk management
measures explicitly integrating knowledge of and uncertainties in projected changes in exposure,vulnerability, and climate extremes. The effectiveness of efforts to manage projected disaster risks at the national
level are dependent on a range of factors, including the effectiveness of the system for managing current risks, theability of the system to flexibly respond to new knowledge, the availability of suitable data, and the resources availableto invest in longer-term risk reduction and adaptation measures. Developed countries are better equipped financiallyand institutionally to adopt explicit measures to effectively respond and adapt to projected changes in exposure,
vulnerability, and climate extremes than developing countries. Nonetheless, all countries face challenges in assessing,
understanding, and then responding to such projected changes. [6.3.2, 6.6]
Measures that provide benefits under current climate and a range of future climate change scenarios,
called low-regrets measures, are available starting points for addressing projected trends in exposure,
vulnerability, and climate extremes. They have the potential to offer benefits now and lay the foundation
for addressing projected changes ( high agreement, medium evidence ). The assessment considered such ‘low’
regrets options across a range of key sectors, with some of the most commonly cited measures associated with
improvements to early warning systems, health surveillance, water supply, sanitation, and drainage systems; climate
proofing of major infrastructure and enforcement of building codes; better education and awareness; and restoration
of degraded ecosystems and nature conservation. Many of these low-regrets strategies produce co-benefits; help
address other development goals, such as improvements in livelihoods, human well-being, and biodiversity conservation;and help minimize the scope for maladaptation. [6.3.1, Table 6-1]Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters343Ecosystem-based solutions in the context of changing climate risks can offer ‘triple-win’ solutions, as they
can provide cost-effective risk reduction, support biodiversity conservation, and enable improvements ineconomic livelihoods and human well-being, particularly for the poor and vulnerable (high agreement,
robust evidence) . The assessment found that such ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, including mangrove
conservation and rehabilitation, integrated catchment management, and sustainable forest and fisheries management,also minimize the scope for maladaptation in developed and developing countries. In choosing amongst ecosystem-
based adaptation options, decisionmakers may need to make tradeoffs between particular climate risk reductionstrategies and other valued ecosystem services. [6.5.2]
Insurance-related instruments are key mechanisms for helping households, business, and governments
absorb the losses from disasters; but their uptake is unequally distributed across regions and hazards, andoften public-private partnerships are required ( high agreement, robust evidence ). Disaster insurance and
other risk transfer instruments covered about 20% of reported weather-related losses over the period 1980 to 2003.Distribution, though, is uneven, with about 40% of the losses insured in high-income as compared to 4% of losses inlow-income countries. Existing national insurance systems differ widely as to whether policies are compulsory orvoluntary, and importantly in how systems allocate liability and responsibility for disaster risks across society. Withchanging weather and extreme events, vulnerability, and exposure, extended and innovative private-public sectorpartnerships are required to better estimate and price risk as well as to develop robust insurance-related products,which may be supported in developing countries by development partner funds. [6.5.3]
Pooling of risk by and between national governments contributes to reducing the fiscal and socioeconomic
consequences of disasters ( medium agreement, medium evidence ). As national governments hold a large
portfolio of public liabilities (infrastructure, public assets, and the provision of disaster relief), risk aggregation andpooling are expected to become more important given projected impacts of climate change and trends in vulnerabilityand exposure. In addition, particularly for small, low-income, and highly exposed countries, risk transfer of public sectorassets and relief expenditure recently have become a cornerstone of disaster risk reduction. Key innovative and prom ising
applications recently implemented comprise sovereign insurance for hurricane risk, insurance for humanitarian assis tance
following droughts, and intergovernmental risk pooling. [6.4.3, 6.5.3]
Flexible and adaptive national systems are better suited to manage projected trends and associated
uncertainties in exposure, vulnerability, and weather and climate extremes than static and rigid nationalsystems ( high agreement, limited evidence ). Adaptive management brings together different scientific, social, and
economic information, experiences, and traditional knowledge into decisionmaking through ‘learning by doing.’ Multi-criteria analysis, scenario planning, and flexible decision paths offer options for taking action when faced with largeuncertainties or incomplete information. National systems for managing disaster risk can adapt to climate change andshifting exposure and vulnerability by (i) frequently assessing and mainstreaming knowledge of dynamic risks;(ii) adopting ‘low regrets’ strategies; (iii) improving learning and feedback across disaster, climate, and developmentorganizations at all scales; (iv) addressing the root causes of poverty and vulnerability; (v) screening investments for
climate change-related impacts and risks to minimize scope for maladaptation; and (vi) increasing standing capacity
for emergency response as climatic conditions change over time. [6.6.1, 6.6.2, 6.6.4]Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters344Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
6.1. Introduction
The socioeconomic impacts of disaster events can be significant in all
countries, but low- and middle-income countries are especially vulnerable,and experience higher fatalities even when exposed to hazards of similarmagnitude (O’Brien et al., 2006; Thomalla et al., 2006; Ibarraran et al.,
2009; IFRC, 2010). The number of deaths per cyclone event in the last
several decades, for example, was highest in low-income countries eventhough a higher proportion of population exposed to cyclones lives incountries with higher income; 11% of the people exposed to hazardslive in low human development countries, but they account for morethan 53% of the total recorded deaths resulting from disasters (UNDP ,2004a). At the same time, while in absolute terms the direct economiclosses from disasters are far greater in high-income countries, middle-and low-income states bear the heaviest burden of these costs in termsof damage relative to annual gross domestic product (GDP: UNDP ,2004a; DFID, 2005; O’Brien et al., 2006; Kellenberg et al., 2008; Pelhamet al., 2011). This burden has been increasing in the middle-incomecountries, where the asset base is rapidly expanding and losses over theperiod from 2001 to 2006 amounted to about 1% of GDP . For the low-income group, losses totaled an average of 0.3% and for the high-income countries amounted to less than 0.1% of GDP (Cummins andMahul, 2009). In some particularly exposed countries, including manysmall island developing states, these wealth losses expressed as apercentage of GDP can be considerably higher, with the average costsover disaster and non-disaster years close to 10%, such as reported forGrenada and St. Lucia (World Bank and UN, 2010). In extreme cases, thecosts of individual events can be as high as 200% of the annual GDP asexperienced in the Polynesian island nation of Niue following cycloneHeta in 2004, or in the Hurricane Ivan event affecting Grenada in 2004(McKenzie et al., 2005).
In terms of the macroeconomic and developmental consequences of
high exposure to disaster risk, a growing body of literature has shownsignificant adverse effects in developing countries (Otero and Marti,1995; Charveriat, 2000; Crowards, 2000; Murlidharan and Shah, 2001;ECLAC, 2002, 2003; Mechler, 2004; Hochrainer, 2006; Noy, 2009). Theseinclude reduced direct and indirect tax revenue, dampened investment,
and reduced long-term economic growth through their negative effect
on a country’s credit rating and an increase in interest rates for external
borrowing. Among the reasons behind limited coping capacity of
individuals, communities, and governments are reduced tax bases and
high levels of indebtedness, combined with limited household income andsavings, a lack of disaster risk transfer and other financing instruments,
few capital assets, and limited social insurance. 
This body of evidence emphasizes that disasters can cause a setback for
development, and even a reversal of recent development gains in the
short- to medium-term, emphasizing the point that disaster riskmanagement is a development issue as much as a humanitarian one.
Poor development status of communities and countries increases their
sensitivity to disasters. Disaster impacts can also force households to fallbelow the basic needs poverty line, further increasing their vulnerabilityto other shocks (Owens et al., 2003; Lal, 2010). Consequently, disasters
are seen as barriers for development, requiring ex-ante disaster riskreduction policies that also target poverty and development (del Ninnoet al., 2003; Owens et al., 2003; Skoufias, 2003; Benson and Clay, 2004;Hallegatte et al., 2007; Raddatz, 2007; Cardona et al., 2010; IFRC, 2010).However, some literature suggests that disasters may not always havea negative effect on economic growth and development and forsome countries disasters may be regarded as a problem of, and not for
development (Albala-Bertrand, 1993; Skidmore and Toya, 2002; Caselliand Malthotra, 2004; Hallegatte and Ghil, 2007). Disasters have alsobeen considered to increase economic growth in the short term as well
as spur positive economic growth and technological renewal in thelonger term, depending on the domestic capacity of nations to rebuildand the inflow of international assistance (Skidmore and Toya, 2002).This observation may be partially attributable to national accounting
practices, which positively record reconstruction efforts but do notaccount for the immediate destruction of assets and wealth in somecases (Skidmore and Toya, 2002). 
To better respond to the impacts of disasters on human livelihoods,
environment, and economies, national disaster risk management systemshave evolved in recent years, guided in some cases by internationalinstruments, particularly the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015and more recently as part of the adaptation agenda under the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC; seeSection 7.3). Increasing knowledge, understanding, and experiences indealing with disaster risks have gradually contributed to a paradigmshift globally that recognizes the importance of reducing risks byaddressing underlying drivers of vulnerability and exposure, such astargeting poverty, improving human well-being, better environmentalmanagement, and adaptation to climate change as well as respondingto and rebuilding after disaster events (Yodmani, 2001; IFRC, 2004,2010; Thomalla et al., 2006; UNISDR, 2008a; Venton and LaTrobe, 2008;Pelham et al., 2011). While governments cannot act alone, the majorityare well placed and equipped to support communities and the privatesector to address disaster risks. Yet recent reported experiences suggestthat countries vary considerably in their responses, and concerns remainabout the lack of integration of disaster risk management into sustainabledevelopment policies and planning as well as insufficient implementationat different levels (CCCD, 2009; UNFCCC, 2008b).
It is at the national level that overarching development policies and
legislative frameworks are formulated and implemented to createappropriate enabling environments to guide other stakeholders toreduce, share, and transfer risks, albeit in different ways (Carter, 1992;Freeman et al., 2003).  National-level governments in developed coun tries
are often the de facto ‘insurers of last resort’ and used to be consideredthe most effective insurance instruments of society (Priest, 1996).Governments also have the ability to mainstream risks associated withclimate variability and change into existing disaster risk managementand sectoral development, policies, and plans, albeit to differing degreesdepending on their capacity. These include initiatives to assess risks anduncertainties, manage these across sectors, share and transfer risks, and345establish baseline information and research priorities (Freeman et al.,
2003; Mechler, 2004; Prabhakar et al., 2009). Ideally, national-levelinstitutions are best able to respond to the challenges of climateextremes, particularly given that when disasters occur they oftensurpass people and businesses’ coping capacity (OAS, 1991; Otero andMarti, 1995; Benson and Clay, 2002a,b). National governments are alsobetter placed to appreciate key uncertainties and risks and takestrategic actions, particularly based on their power of taxation (seeSections 6.4.3 and 6.5.3), although particularly exposed developingcountries may be financially challenged to attend to the risks andliabilities imposed by natural disasters (Mechler, 2004; Cummins andMahul, 2009; UNISDR, 2011a).
Changes in weather and climate extremes and related impacts pose
new challenges for national disaster risk management systems, whichin many instances remain poorly adapted to the risks posed by existingclimatic variability and extremes (Lavell, 1998; McGray et al., 2007;Venton and La Trobe, 2008; Mitchell et al., 2010b). Nonetheless, valuablelessons for advancing adaptation to climate change can be drawn fromexisting national disaster risk management systems (McGray et al., 2007;Mitchell et al., 2010b). Such national systems are comprised of actorsoperating across scales, fulfilling a range of roles and functions, guidedby an enabling environment of institutions, international agreements,and experience of previous disasters (Carter, 1992; Freeman et al., 2003).These systems vary considerably between countries in terms of theircapacities and effectiveness and in the way responsibilities are distributedbetween actors. Countries also put differential emphasis on integrationof disaster risk management with development processes and tacklingvulnerability and exposure, compared with preparing for and respondingto extreme events and disasters (Cardona et al., 2010). 
Recent global assessments of disaster risk management point to a
general lack of integration of disaster risk management into sustainabledevelopment policies and planning across countries and regions,although progress has been made especially in terms of passinglegislation, in setting up early warning systems, and in strengtheningdisaster preparedness and response (Amendola et al., 2008; UNISDR,2011b; Wisner, 2011). Closing the gap between current provision andwhat is needed for tackling even current climate variability and disaster
risk is a priority for national risk management systems and is also a crucialaspect of countries’ responses to projected climate change. With a historyof managing climatic extremes, involving a large number of experiencedactors across scales and levels of government and widespread instancesof supporting legislation and cross-sectoral coordinating bodies(Section 6.4.2), national disaster risk management systems offer a
promising avenue for supporting adaptation to climate change andreducing projected climate-related disaster risks. 
Accordingly, this chapter assesses the literature on national systems for
managing disaster risks and climate extremes, particularly the design ofsuch systems of functions, actors, and roles they play, emphasizing theimportance of government and governance for improved adaptation toclimate extremes and variability. Focusing particularly on developingcountry challenges, the assessment reflects on the adequacy of existing
knowledge, policies, and practices globally and considers the extent towhich the current disaster risk management systems may need toevolve to deal with the uncertainties associated with and the effects ofclimate change on disaster risks. Section 6.2 characterizes nationalsystems for managing existing climate extremes and disaster risk byfocusing on the actors that help create the system – national and sub-national government agencies, bilateral and multilateral organizations,the private sector, research agencies, civil society, and community-basedorganizations. Drawing on a range of examples from developed anddeveloping countries, Sections 6.3 through 6.5 describe what is known
about the status of managing current and future risk, what is desirable
in an effective national system for adapting to climate change, and whatgaps in knowledge exist. The latter parts of the chapter are organizedby the set of functions undertaken by the actors discussed in Section 6.2.The functions are divided into three main categories – those associatedwith planning and policies (Section 6.3), strategies (Section 6.4), andpractices, including methods and tools (Section 6.5), for reducingclimatic risks. Section 6.6 reflects on how national systems for managingclimate extremes and disaster risk can become more closely aligned tothe challenges posed by climate change and development – particularlythose associated with uncertainty, changing patterns of risk andexposure, and the impacts of climate change on vulnerability andpoverty. Aspects of Section 6.6 are further elaborated in Chapter 8.
6.2. National Systems and Actors
for Managing the Risks fromClimate Extremes and Disasters
Managing climate-related disaster risks is a concern of multiple actors,
working across scales from international, national, and sub-national andcommunity levels, and often in partnership, to ultimately help individuals,households, communities, and societies to reduce their risks (Twigg,2004; Schipper, 2009; Wisner, 2011). Comprising national and sub-national governments, the private sector, research bodies, civil society,and community-based organizations and communities, effective nationalsystems would ideally have each actor performing to their acceptedfunctions and capacities. Each actor would play differential butcomplementary roles across spatial and temporal scales (UNISDR,2008a; Schipper, 2009; Miller et al., 2010) and would draw on a mixtureof scientific and local knowledge to shape their actions and theirappreciation of the dynamic nature of risk (see Figure 6-1). Given thatnational systems are at the core of a country’s capacity to meet thechallenges of observed and projected trends in exposure, vulnerability,and weather and climate extremes, this section assesses the literatureon the roles played by different actors working within such nationalsystems. 
Figure 6-1 encapsulates the discussions to follow on the interface and
interaction between different levels of actors, roles, and functions, withthe centrality of national organizations and institutions engaging at theinternational level and creating enabling environments to supportChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters346actions across the country, supported by scientific information and
traditional knowledge.
6.2.1. National and Sub-National Governments 
The national level plays a key role in governing and managing disasterrisks because national governments are central to providing riskmanagement-related public goods as they maintain organizational and
financial authority in planning and providing such goods. National
governments have the moral and legal responsibility to ensureeconomic and social well-being, including safety and security of their
citizens from disasters (UNISDR, 2004). It is also argued that it is
government’s responsibility to protect the poorest and most vulnerablecitizens from disasters, and to implement disaster risk management that
reaches all (McBean, 2008; O’Brien et al., 2008; CCCD, 2009). In termsof risk ownership, government and public disaster authorities ‘own’ alarge part of current and future extreme event risks and are expected to
govern and regulate risks borne by other parts of society (Mechler,
2004). Various normative literature sources support this. As oneexample, literature on economic welfare theory suggests that national
governments are exposed to natural disaster risk and potential lossesdue to their three main functions: provision of public goods and services
(e.g., education, clean environment, and security); the redistribution ofincome; and stabilizing the economy (Musgrave, 1959; Twigg, 2004;
White et al., 2004; McBean, 2008; Shaw et al., 2009). The risks faced bygovernments include losing public infrastructure, assets, and nationalreserves. National-level governments also redistribute income acrossmembers of society and thus are called upon when those are in need(Linnerooth-Bayer and Amendola, 2000), or when members of societyare in danger of becoming poor, and in need of relief payments tosustain a basic standard of living, especially in countries with low percapita income and/or that have large proportions of the population inpoverty (Cummins and Mahul, 2009). Finally, it can be argued thatgovernments are expected to stabilize the economy, for example, bysupply-side interventions when the economy is in disequilibrium.
National-level governments are often called ‘insurers of last resort’ as
the governments are often the final entity that private households andfirms turn to in case of need, although the degree of compliance andability to honor those responsibilities by governments differs significantlyacross countries. Nonetheless, in the context of a changing climate, it isargued that governments have a particularly critical role to play in relationto not only addressing the current gaps in disaster risk management butalso in response to uncertainties and changing needs due to increasesin the frequency, magnitude, and duration of some climate extremes(Katz and Brown, 1992; Meehl et al., 2000; Christensen et al., 2007; alsorefer to Chapter 3).

Figure 6-1 | National system of actors and functions for managing disaster risk and adapting to climate change.347Different levels of governments – national, sub-national, and local
level – as well as respective sectoral agencies play multiple roles inaddressing drivers of vulnerability and managing the risk of extremeevents, although their effectiveness varies within a country as well asacross countries. They are well placed to create multi-sectoral platformsto guide, build, and develop policy, regulatory, and institutionalframeworks that prioritize risk management (Handmer and Dovers, 2007;UNISDR, 2008b; OECD, 2009); integrate disaster risk management withother policy domains like development or environmental management,which often are separated in different ministries (UNISDR 2004, 2009c;White et al., 2004; Tompkins et al., 2008); and address drivers ofvulnerability and assist the most vulnerable populations (McBean, 2008;CCCD, 2009). Governments across sectors and levels also provide manypublic goods and services that help address drivers of vulnerability aswell as those that support disaster risk management (White et al., 2004;Shaw et al., 2009) through education, training, and research (Twigg,2004; McBean, 2008; Shaw et al., 2009).
Governments also allocate financial and administrative resources for
disaster risk management, as well as provide political authority (Spence,2004; Twigg, 2004; Handmer and Dovers, 2007; CCCD, 2009). Evidencesuggests that successful disaster risk management is partly contingenton resources being made available at all administration levels, but todate, insufficient policy and institutional commitments have been madeto disaster risk management in many countries, particularly at the localgovernment level (Twigg, 2004; UNISDR, 2009d). It is argued thatgovernments also have an important role to guide and support the privatesector, civil society organizations, and other development partners inplaying their differential roles in managing disaster risk (O’Brien et al.,2008; Prabhakar et al., 2009). 
6.2.2. Private Sector Organizations
The private sector plays a small, but increasingly important role indisaster risk management and adaptation, and some aspects of disasterrisk management may be suitable for nongovernmental stakeholders toimplement, albeit this would often effectively be coordinated within a
framework created and enabled by governments. Three avenues for private
sector engagement may be identified: (1) corporate social responsibility(CSR); (2) public-private partnerships (PPP); and (3) businesses modelapproaches. CSR involves voluntary advocacy and raising awareness by
businesses for disaster risk reduction as well as involving funding
support and the contribution of volunteers and expertise to implementrisk management measures. PPPs focus on enhancing the provision of
public goods for disaster risk reduction in joint undertakings between
public and private sector players. The business model approach pursues
the integration and alignment of disaster risk reduction with operationaland strategic goals of an enterprise (Warhurst, 2006; Roeth, 2009).While CSR and PPP have received substantial attention, business model
approaches remain rather untouched areas, one very important excep tion
being the insurance industry as a supplier of tools for transferring andsharing disaster risks and losses.In terms of business model approaches, insurance is a key sector. In
exchange for pre-disaster premium payments, disaster insurance andother risk transfer instruments in 2010 covered about 30% of disasterlosses overall (Munich Re, 2011). In terms of weather-related events, forthe period 1980 to 2003, insurance overall covered about 20% of thelosses, yet the distribution according to country income groups isuneven, with about 40% of the losses insured in high-income ascompared to 4% in low-income countries (Mills, 2007). In developingcountries, despite complexities and uncertainties involved in bothsupply and demand for risk transfer, risk financing mechanisms havebeen found to demonstrate substantial potential for absorbing thefinancial burden of disasters (Pollner, 2000; Andersen, 2001; Varangis etal., 2002; Auffret, 2003; Dercon, 2005; Hess and Syroka, 2005;Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005; Skees et al., 2005; World Bank, 2007;Cummins and Mahul, 2009; Hazell and Hess, 2010). There is, though,some uncertainty as to the extent to which the private sector wouldcontinue to play this role in the context of a changing environment dueto uncertainty and imperfect information, missing and misalignedmarkets, and financial constraints (Smit et al., 2001; Aakre et al., 2010).Private insurers are concerned about changes in risks and associated riskambiguity, that is, the uncertainty about the changes induced by climatechange in terms of potentially modified extreme event intensity andfrequency. Accordingly, as climate change, and other drivers such aschanges in vulnerability and exposure (see Chapters 1, 2, and 3), areprojected to lead to changes in frequency and intensity of someweather risks and extremes, insurers may be less prepared to underwriteinsurance for extreme event risks. Innovative private-public sectorpartnerships may thus be required to better estimate and price risk aswell as develop robust insurance-related products, which may besupported in developing countries by development partner funds aswell (see Section 6.5.3 and Case Study 9.2.13).
Professional societies (such as builders and architects) and trade
associations also play a key role in developing and implementingstandards and practices for disaster risk reduction. These practices mayinclude national and international standards and model building codesthat are adopted in the regulations of local, state, and nationalgovernments. Although the potential for private sector players indisaster risk reduction in sectors such as engineering and construction,information communication technology, media and communication, aswell as utilities and transportation seems large, limited evidence of
successful private sector activity has been documented, owing to anumber of reasons (Roeth, 2009). The business case for private sectorinvolvement in disaster risk reduction remains unclear, hampering privatesector engagement. Companies may also be averse to reporting activitiesthat are fundamental to their business; and, in more community-focused projects, companies often work with local nongovernmentalorganizations (NGOs) and do not often report such efforts. Consideringclimate variability and change within the business model, companies maybe an important entry point for disaster risk reduction, particularly interms of guaranteeing global value chains in the presence of potentiallylarge-scale disruptions triggered by climate-related disasters. For example,the economic viability of the Chinese coastal zone – the economicChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters348heartland of China and home to many multinational companies producing
a large share of consumer goods globally – is highly exposed to typhoonrisk and will increasingly depend on well-implemented disaster riskreduction mechanisms (Roeth, 2009).
6.2.3. Civil Society and Community-Based Organizations
At the national level, civil society organizations (CSOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) play a significant role in developing initiativesto respond to disasters, reduce the risk of disasters, and, recently, adaptto climate-related hazards (see Section 5.1 for a discussion of ‘local’ and
‘community’ and Section 5.4.1 for the role of CBOs at the local level).
CSOs and CBOs are referred to here as the wide range of associationsaround which society voluntarily organizes itself, with CBO referring tothose associations primarily concerned with local interests and ties. CSOand CBO initiatives in the field of disaster risk management, which mayusually begin as a humanitarian concern, often evolve to also embracethe broader challenge of disaster risk reduction following community-focused risk assessment, including specific activities targeting educationand advocacy; environmental management; sustainable agriculture;infrastructure construction; and increased livelihood diversification(McGray et al., 2007; CARE International, 2008; Oxfam America, 2008;Practical Action Bangladesh, 2008; SEEDS India, 2008; Tearfund, 2008;World Vision, 2008).
Recently in some high-risk regions there has been rapid development of
national platforms of CSOs and CBOs that have been working togetherin order to push for the transformation of policies and practices relatedto disaster risk reduction. This is true in the case of Central America,where at least four platforms are functioning in the same number ofcountries, involving more than 120 CSOs and CBOs (CRGR, 2007a). Theefforts of these platforms have been aimed at advocacy, training,research, and capacity building in disaster risk reduction. In CentralAmerica, the experience is that advocacy on climate policy constructionhas become a new feature of such platforms since 2007 (CRGR, 2009).While beyond the scope of this chapter, on balance the majority of CSOsand CBOs focus efforts at the local level, trying to link disaster risk
management with local development goals associated with water,
sanitation, education, and health, for example (GNDR 2009; Lavell,2009). Faith-based organizations are also influential in assisting local
communities in disaster risk management, not only providing pastoral
care in times of disasters but also playing an important role in raising
awareness and training, with many international development partners
often working with local church groups to build community resilience
(see, for example, ADPC 2007; Gero et al., 2011; Tearfund, 2011). 
In several countries in Latin America, CSOs and CBOs are considered, by
law, as part of national systems for civil protection (Lavell and Franco,1996; CRGR, 2007b) though participation, with the exception of NationalRed Cross/Red Crescent Societies, remains patchy (UNISDR, 2008c). In
some countries where governments are not able or willing to fulfill
certain disaster risk management functions, such as training, supportingfood security, providing adequate housing, and preparedness, CSOs and
CBOs have stepped in (Benson et al., 2001). While CSOs often facechallenges in securing resources for replicating successful initiatives andscaling out geographically (CARE International, 2008; Oxfam America,2008; Practical Action Bangladesh, 2008; SEEDS India, 2008; Tearfund,2008; World Vision, 2008); sustaining commitment to work with localgovernments and stakeholders over the long term and maintainingpartnerships with local authorities (Oxfam America, 2008); andcoordinating and linking local-level efforts with sub-national governmentinitiatives and national plans during the specific project implementation(SEEDS India, 2008), they are particularly well positioned to draw linksbetween disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation giventhat such organizations are currently among the few to combine suchexpertise (Mitchell et al., 2010b).
6.2.4. Bilateral and Multilateral Agencies 
In developing countries, particularly where the government is weak andhas limited resources, bilateral and multilateral agencies play asignificant role in supplying financial, technical, and in some casesstrategic support to government and nongovernment agencies totackle the multifaceted challenges of disaster risk management andclimate change adaptation in the context of national developmentgoals (e.g., AusAid, 2009; DFID, 2011). Multilateral agencies are referredto here as international institutions with governmental membershipthat have a significant focus on development and aid recipient countries.
Such agencies can include United Nations agencies, regional groupings(e.g., some European Union agencies), and multilateral developmentbanks (e.g., World Bank, Asian Development Bank). Bilateral agencies(e.g., United Kingdom Department for International Development) aretaken here as national institutions that focus on the relationshipbetween one government and another. In the development sphere,this is often in the context of a richer government providing supportto a poorer government. The role of international institutions,including bilateral and multilateral agencies, is discussed extensively inSection 7.3.
Bilateral and multilateral agencies have been key actors in advancing
mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptationinto development planning (Eriksen and Næss, 2003; Klein et al., 2007;see Section 6.3). This has primarily been driven by a concern thatdevelopment investments are increasingly exposed to climate- anddisaster-related risks and that climate change poses security concerns(Harris, 2009; Persson and Klein, 2009). As a result, such agencies areinfluencing development policy and implementation at a national levelas they require disaster and climate risk assessments and environmentalscreening to be conducted at different points in the project approvalprocess and in some cases retrospectively when projects are alreadyunderway (Klein et al., 2007; OECD, 2009; Hammill and Tanner, 2010). Arange of tools and methods have been developed, primarily by bilateraland multilateral agencies, to support such processes (Klein et al., 2007;Hammill and Tanner, 2010).Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters349While significant progress has been made in developing appropriate
tools and methods for assessing and screening risk, many bilateral andmultilateral agencies continue to address disaster risk management andclimate change adaptation separately, and link with respective regionaland national agencies in the context of distinct international instruments(Mitchell and Van Aalst, 2008; Mitchell et al., 2010b; Gero et al., 2011).However, recent assessments suggest that the situation is improving,partially attributable to the process of authoring this Special Report andin the focus on risk management in the text of the Bali Action Plan(2007) and Cancun Agreement (2010) (Mitchell et al., 2010b; seeSection 7.3.2.2 for more detail). 
The diversity of national contexts requires bilateral and multilateral
agencies to adopt different modalities to maximize the effectiveness oftechnical, financial, and strategic support. For example, in the Pacific andthe Caribbean, regional bodies (e.g., the Caribbean Disaster EmergencyManagement Agency) commonly operate as an intermediary, channelingresources to island countries where it is not efficient for internationalagencies to establish a permanent adaptation or risk management-focused presence (Hay, 2009; Gero et al., 2011). In countries with weaknational institutions, bilateral and multilateral agencies commonly chooseto channel resources through civil society organizations with the intentionof ensuring that resources reach the poorest and most vulnerable(Wickham et al., 2009). In such situations, coordination betweenagencies can be challenging and in certain circumstances can furtherreduce the risk management capacity of government organizations(Wickham et al., 2009). However, the broad trend is to maximize thesupport to national governments by seeking to improve national own ership
of risk management and adaptation processes and in that respectsupport national governments to lead national systems (GFDRR, 2010;DFID, 2011). 
6.2.5. Research and Communication
The effectiveness of national systems for managing climate extremes anddisaster risks is highly dependent on the availability and communicationof robust and timely scientific data and information (Sperling and
Szekely, 2005; Thomalla et al., 2006; CACCA, 2010) and traditionalknowledge (Mercer et al., 2007; Kelman et al., 2011; see Box 5-7) to informnot only community-based decisions and policymakers who managenational approaches to disaster risk and climate change adaptation, but
also researchers who provide further analytical information to support
such decisions. 
Scientific and research organizations range from specialized research
centers and universities, to regional organizations, to national researchagencies, multilateral agencies, and CSOs playing differential roles, butgenerally continue to divide into disaster risk management or climate
change adaptation communities. Scientific research bodies play importantroles in managing climate extremes and disaster risks by: (a) supportingthematic programs to study the evolution and consequences of past
hazard events, such as cyclones, droughts, sandstorms, and floods;(b) analyzing time-and-space dependency in patterns of weather-related
risks; (c) building cooperative networks for early warning systems,modeling, and long-term prediction; (d) actively engaging in technicalcapacity building and training; (e) translating scientific evidence intoadaptation practice; (f) collating traditional knowledge and lessonslearned for wider d issemination; and (g) translating scientific information
into user-friendly forms for community consumption (Sperling andSzekely, 2005; Thomalla et al.,  2006; Aldunce and González, 2009). 
Disaster practitioners largely focus on making use of short-term weather
forecasting and effective dissemination and communication of hazardinformation and responses (Thomalla et al., 2006). Such climate changeexpertise can typically be found in meteorological agencies, environmentor energy departments, and in academic institutions (Sperling and Szekely,2005), while disaster risk assessments have been at the core of manymultilateral and civil society organizations and national disastermanagement authorities (Sperling and Szekely, 2005; Thomalla et al.,2006). Although progress has been reported in the communication andavailability of scientific information, there is still a lack of, for example,sufficient local or sub-national data on hazards and risk assessments tounderpin area-specific disaster risk management (Chung, 2009; UNISDR,2009c).
6.3. Planning and Policies for Integrated
Risk Management, Adaptation, andDevelopment Approaches
Given that learning will come from doing and in spite of differences,
there are many ways that countries can learn from each other inprioritizing their climate and disaster risks; in mainstreaming climatechange adaptation and disaster risk management into plans, policies,and processes for development; and in securing additional financial andhuman resources needed to meet increasing demands (UNDP , 2002;Thomalla et al., 2006; Schipper, 2009). This subsection will addressframeworks for national disaster risk management and climate changeadaptation planning and policies (Section 6.3.1), the mainstreaming ofplans and policies nationally (Section 6.3.2), and the various sectoraldisaster risk management and climate change adaptation optionsavailable for national systems (Section 6.3.3), recognizing the range ofactors engaged in these processes as described in Section 6.2. 
6.3.1. Developing and Supporting National
Planning and Policy Processes
National and sub-national government and statutory agencies have
a range of planning and policy options to help create the enablingenvironments for departments, public service agencies, the privatesector, and individuals to act (UNDP , 2002; Heltberg et al., 2009; OECD,2009; ONERC, 2009; Hammill and Tanner, 2010 ). When considering
disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change actions, itis often the scale of the potential climate and disaster risks and impacts,Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters350the capacity of the governments or agencies to act, the level of certainty
about future changes, the timeframes within which these future impactsand disasters will occur, and the costs and consequences of decisionsthat play an important role in their prioritization and adoption (Heltberget al., 2008; World Bank, 2008; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). 
The complexity and diversity of adaptation to climate change situations
implies that there can be no single recommended approach for assessing,planning, and implementing adaptation options (Füssel, 2007; Hammilland Tanner, 2010; Lu, 2011). When the planning horizons are short andadaptation decisions only impact the next one or two decades, adaptationto recent climate variability and observed trends may be sufficient(Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Lu, 2011). For long-lastingrisks and decisions, the timing and sequencing of adaptation optionsand incorporation of climate change scenarios become increasinglyimportant (Hallegatte, 2009; OECD, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).Studies suggest that the most pragmatic adaptation and disaster riskmanagement options depend on the timeframes under consideration andthe adaptive capacity and ability of the country or sectoral agencies toeffectively integrate information on climate change and its uncertainties(McGray et al., 2007; Biesbroek et al., 2010; Krysanova et al., 2010;Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Juhola and Westerhoff, 2011). Given the variousuncertainties at decisionmaking scales, studies suggest that adaptationactions based on information on the observed climate and its trendsmay be preferable in some cases while, in other cases with long-termirreversible decisions, climate change scenario-guided adaptationactions will be required (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; OECD, 2009;Krysanova et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Climate change scenariosprovide needed guidance for adaptation options when the direction ofthe climate change impacts are known and when the decisions involve
long-term building infrastructure, development plans, and actions toavoid catastrophic impacts from more intense extreme events(Haasnoot et al., 2009; Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). 
In dealing with climate change and disaster risk uncertainties, many
national studies identify gradations or categories of adaptation anddisaster risk management planning and policy options (Dessai and Hulme,2007; Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010; Mastrandreaet al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). These gradations in options rangefrom climate vulnerability or resilience approaches, sometimesdescribed as ‘bottom-up’; vulnerability, tipping point, critical threshold, orpolicy-first approaches to climate modeling, impact-based approaches,sometimes described as ‘top-down’; model or impacts-first; science-first; or classical approaches (as illustrated in Figure 6-2 and outlined inthe sectoral option headings of Table 6-1 and described in Section6.3.3). Although the bottom-up and top-down terms sometimes refer toscale, subject matter, or policy (e.g., national versus local, physical tosocioeconomic systems), the terms are used here to describe thesequences or steps needed to develop adaptation and disaster riskmanagement plans and policies at the national level. When dealing withlong-term future climate change risks, the main differences between thescenarios-impacts-first and vulnerability-thresholds-first approaches liein the timing or sequencing of the stages of the analyses, as shownin Figure 6-2 (Kwadijk et al., 2010; Ranger et al., 2010). Although thisdifference appears subtle, it has significant implications for themanagement of uncertainty, the timing of adaptation options, and theefficiency of the policymaking (Dessai and Hulme, 2007; Auld, 2008b;Kwadijk et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Lu, 2011). For example,

Figure 6-2 | Top-down scenario, impacts-first approach (left panel) and bottom-up vulnerability, thresholds-first approach (right panel) – c omparison of stages involved in identifying
and evaluating adaptation options under changing climate conditions. Adapted from Kwadijk et al. (2010) and Ranger et al. (2010 ).351when the lifespan of a decision, policy, or measure has implications for
multiple decades or the decision is irreversible and sensitive to climate,the performance of adaptation and risk reduction options across arange of climate change scenarios becomes critical (Auld, 2008b;Kwadijk et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). 
Vulnerability thresholds-based approaches start at the level of the
decisionmaker, identify desired system objectives and constraints,consider how resilient or robust a system or sector is to changes in cli mate,
assess adaptive capacity and critical ‘tipping points’ or threshold points,then identify the viable adaptation strategies that would be required toimprove resilience and robustness under future climate scenarios(Auld, 2008b; Urwin and Jordan, 2008; Hallegatte, 2009; Kwadijk et al.,2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). 
Vulnerability-
thresholds approaches can be independent of any specific future climate
condition. 
Options that are known as ‘no regrets’ and ‘low regrets’ provide benefits
under any range of climate change scenarios, although they may notbe optimal for every future scenario, and are recommended whenuncertainties over future climate change directions and impacts arehigh (Dessai and Hulme, 2007; Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; Kwadijket al., 2010). These ‘low regrets’ adaptation options typically includeimprovements to coping strategies or reductions in exposure to knownthreats (Auld, 2008b; Kwadijk et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010), suchas better forecasting and warning systems, use of climate informationto better manage agriculture in drought-prone regions, flood-proofingof homesteads, or interventions to ensure up-to-date climatic designinformation for engineering projects. The vulnerability-thresholds-firstapproaches are particularly useful for identifying priority areas foraction now, assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions whencurrent climate-related risks are not satisfactorily controlled, whenclimatic stress factors are closely intertwined with non-climatic factors,planning horizons are short, resources are very limited (i.e., expertise,data, time, and money), or uncertainties about future climate impactsare very large (Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Hallegatte, 2009;Prabhakar et al., 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
Vulnerability-thresholds-first approaches have sometimes been critiqued
for the time required to complete a vulnerability assessment, for their
reliance on experts, and for their largely qualitative results and limited
comparability across regions (Patt et al., 2005; Kwadijk et al., 2010).Vulnerability-thresholds approaches can sometimes prove less suitedfor guiding future adaptation decisions if coping thresholds change, orif climate change risks emerge that are outside the range of recent
experiences (e.g., successive drought years could progressively reducecoping thresholds of the rural poor by increasing indebtedness)(McGray et al., 2007; Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Auld, 2008b;Hallegatte, 2009; Prabhakar et al., 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
The scenarios-impact-first approaches typically start with several climate
change modeling scenarios and socioeconomic scenarios, evaluate the
expected impacts of climate change, and subsequently identify adapta tionand risk reduction options to reduce projected risks (Kwadijk et al.,
2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). 
The scenarios-
impacts-first approaches are most useful to raise awareness of theproblem, to explore possible adaptation strategies, and to identifyresearch priorities, 
especially when current climate and disaster risks
can be effectively controlled, when sufficient data and resources areavailable to produce state-of-the-art climate scenarios at the spatialresolutions relevant for adaptation, and when future climate impactscan be projected reliably (Kwadijk et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).Scenarios-impacts approaches 
depend strongly on the chosen climate
change scenarios and downscaling techniques, as well as the assumptionsabout scientific and socioeconomic uncertainties (OECD, 2009; Kwadijket al., 2010). Pure scenarios-impacts approaches may not be available atthe spatial scales relevant to the decisionmaker, may not be applicablefor the purpose of the decisionmaker, and 
usually give less consideration
to current risks from natural climate variability, to non-climatic stressors,and to key uncertainties along with their implications for robustadaptation policies (Füssel, 2007; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). In practice,there are very limited examples of actual adaptation policies beingdeveloped and planned adaptation decisions being implemented basedon scenarios-impacts approaches only (Füssel, 2007; Biesbroek et al.,2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).
Increasingly, studies are recognizing that the scenarios-impacts and
vulnerability-thresholds approaches are complementary and need to beintegrated and that both can benefit from the addition of stakeholderand scientific input to determine critical thresholds for climate changevulnerabilities (Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010;Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Critical thresholds (oradaptation tipping points) help in answering the basic adaptationquestions of decision- and policymakers – namely, what are the firstpriority issues that need to be addressed as a result of increasing disasterrisks under climate change and when might these critical thresholds bereached (Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010;Mastrandrea et al., 2010). The integration of scenarios-impacts andvulnerability-thresholds approaches provides guidance on the sensitivityof sectors and durability of options under different climate changescenarios (Haasnoot et al., 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010; Mastrandrea etal., 2010). Integrated approaches that link changes in climate variables todecisions and policies and express uncertainties in terms of timeframesover which a policy or plan may be effective (i.e., roughly when will thecritical threshold be reached) also provide valuable information forplans and policies and their implementation (Haasnoot et al., 2009;Kwadijk et al., 2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010). 
Regardless of the approaches used, it is important that uncertainty over
future climate change risks not become a barrier to climate change riskreduction actions (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; Krysanova et al., 2010;Wilby and Dessai, 2010). In cases where climate change uncertaintiesremain high, countries may choose to increase or build on their capacityto cope with uncertainty, rather than risk maladaptation from use ofambiguous impact studies or no action (McGray et al., 2007; Hallegatte,2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010).

et al., 2006; Younger et al., 2008.Table 6-1 (continued)355into the future, some studies recommend the use of pro-adaptation and
robust options to deal with climate change uncertainties (Auld, 2008b;Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). These robust options includeactions that are reversible, flexible, less sensitive to future climateconditions (i.e., no and low regret), and can incorporate safety margins(e.g., infrastructure investments), employ ‘soft’ solutions (e.g., ecosystemservices), and are mindful of actions being taken by others to eitherreduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) or adapt to climate change in othersectors (Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Flexible options arethose that provide benefits under a variety of climate conditions orreduce stress on affected systems to increase their flexibility (e.g.,reducing pollution or demand on resources) (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte,2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). 
Options that allow for incremental changes in, for example, infrastructure
over time, or allow incorporation of future change, for example, supportmore flexible systems (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009; OECD, 2009).Uncertainties over future risks can also be accounted for through ‘safetymargin’ or over-design strategies to reduce vulnerability and increaseresiliency at low and sometimes null costs (Auld, 2008b; Hallegatte, 2009).These safety margin strategies have been used to manage future risks forsea level rise and coastal defenses, for water drainage management,and for investments in other infrastructure (Hallegatte, 2009). Givenuncertainties, national policies may need to become more adaptableand flexible, particularly where national plans and policies currentlyoperate within a limited range of conditions and are based on certainty(McGray et al., 2007; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Without flexibility, rigidnational policies may become disconnected from evolving climate risks andbring unintended consequences or maladaptation (Sperling and Szekely,2005; Hallegatte, 2009). Rigid plans and policies that are irreversibleand based on a specific climate scenario that does not materialize canresult in future maladaptation and imply wasted investments or harm topeople and ecosystems that can prove unnecessary.
Several studies indicate that national plans and policies for adaptation
to climate change and disaster risk management tend to favor optionsthat deal with the current or near-term climate risks and ‘win-win’options that satisfy multiple synergies for GHG reduction, disaster risk
management, climate change adaptation, and development issues
(World Bank, 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009; Ribeiro et al., 2009;Fankhauser, 2010; Mitchell and Maxwell, 2010). Many of these ‘win-win’ options include ecosystem-based adaptation actions, sustainableland and water use planning, carbon sequestration, energy efficiency,
and energy and food self-sufficiency. For example, the ecosystem
management practices of afforestation, reforestation, and conservation of
forests offer co-benefits for disaster risk reduction from floods, landslides,avalanches, coastal storms, and drought while contributing to adaptation
to future climates, economic opportunities, increased biomass and
carbon sequestration, energy efficiency, energy savings, as well as energy
and food self sufficiency (Thompson et al., 2009). 
Disaster risk transfer options offer a viable adaptation response to current
and future climate risks and include instruments such as insurance,micro-insurance, and micro-financing; government disaster reserve
funds; government-private partnerships involving risk sharing; and new,innovative insurance mechanisms (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2006;EC, 2009; World Bank, 2010). Risk transfer options can provide muchneeded, immediate liquidity after a disaster, allow for more effectivegovernment response, provide some relief from the fiscal burden placedon governments due to disaster impacts, and constitute critical steps inpromoting more proactive risk management strategies and responses(Arnold, 2008). Case Study 9.2.13 and Section 6.5.3 provide more detailon risk transfer options. 
Even with risk transfer instruments and adaptation to climate change
options in place, residual losses can be realized when extreme events –well beyond those typically expected – result in high impacts. In spite ofthe evidence, decisions to ignore increasing future risks and evencurrent risks remain common, particularly when uncertainties over thedirections of future climate change impacts are high, when capacity isinitially very limited, adaptation options are not available, or when therisks of future impacts are considered to be very low (Linnerooth-Bayerand Mechler, 2006; Heltberg et al., 2009; World Bank, 2010).The lossesfrom deferring adaptation and disaster risk reduction actions are borneby all actors.
Table 6-1 outlines some of the adaptation to climate change and disaster
risk management policy and planning options available nationally forselected sectors and described in the literature. Many of these optionsare incremental actions that complement and reinforce each other. Theactions are organized using the gradations of planning and policyoptions described in this section.
6.3.2. Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management 
and Climate Change Adaptation intoSectors and Organizations
National adaptation to climate change will involve stand-alone adaptation
policies and plans as well as the integration or mainstreaming ofadaptation measures into existing activities (OECD, 2009). Mainstreamingof adaptation and disaster risk management actions implies that national,sub-national, and local authorities adopt, expand, and enhance measuresthat factor disaster and climate risks into their normal plans, policies,strategies, programs, sectors, and organizations (Few et al., 2006; UNISDR,2008a; OECD, 2009; Biesbroek et al., 2010; CACCA, 2010). 
In reality, it can be challenging to provide clear pictures of what
mainstreaming is, let alone how it can be made operational, supported,and strengthened at the various national and sub-national levels (Olhoffand Schaer, 2010). Some studies indicate that the real challenge tomainstreaming adaptation is not planning but implementation(Biesbroek et al., 2010; Krysanova et al., 2010; Tompkins et al., 2010).Some of the barriers to implementation include lack of funding, limitedbudget flexibility, lack of relevant information or expertise, lack ofpolitical will or support, and institutional silos (Krysanova et al., 2010;Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters356Preston et al., 2011). Studies indicate that effective plans, policies, and
programs for adaptation to climate change and disaster risk managementneed to go beyond identifying potential options to include betterinventories of existing assets and liabilities for managing risk andspecific actions for overcoming adaptation barriers (Haasnoot et al.,2009; Preston et al., 2011).
Recent studies investigating the success of existing adaptation plans
and policies for Australia, the United States, countries in Europe, andmajor river basins in Africa and Asia, for example, indicate that there isa need for mainstreaming of adaptation into existing national policiesand plans and a priority for capitalizing on ‘win-win’ or options thattake advantage of synergies with other national objectives (Biesbroek etal., 2010; Tompkins et al., 2010; Preston et al., 2011). The studies foundthat many strategies and institutions were focused to a greater extenton lower-risk actions dealing with science and outreach (knowledgeacquisition) and capacity building rather than moving forward onspecific, more costly and difficult to implement adaptation and disasterrisk management actions and managing at-risk public goods (Tompkinset al., 2010; Preston et al., 2011). 
Preston et al. (2011) found in their studies from Australia, the United
States, and the United Kingdom that most national adaptation strategieswere based on vulnerability assessments informed by broad internationaland national climate change guidance, rather than any consistent orsystematic use of scenarios, and favored bottom-up approaches forcoordination across sectors and multiple government scales. Biesbroeket al. (2010) noted similar results for nine countries in Europe. Tompkinset al. (2010) and Krysanova et al. (2010) found that the sectors with thehighest levels of adaptation implementation in the United Kingdom werethose that tended to be most affected by current weather variability andextremes and that specific government initiatives had been successfulin stimulating adaptation and disaster risk reduction (e.g., mandatoryplanning for flood-prone areas, ISO 14001). Tompkins et al. (2010) alsofound that successful implementation frequently resulted from multipletriggers, that few of these adaptation actions were solely initiated inresponse to climate change, and that the relative impact of weather oncore business and organizational culture encouraged an ability and
willingness to proactively act on climate change information.
Adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management needs to
typically identify more adaptation options than most countries can
reasonably implement in the short term due to resource constraints,
requiring that actions be prioritized (OECD, 2009; Krysanova et al., 2010).Initially, actions that remove the existing barriers to managing disaster
risks from today’s climate variability can help to reduce the even greater
barriers to managing future climate risks (UNDP , 2002, 2004a; CCCD,2009; Prabhakar et al., 2009; Tompkins et al., 2010). As a result, a keychallenge, and an opportunity for mainstreaming adaptation and disaster
risk management, lies in building bridges between current disaster riskmanagement actions for existing climate vulnerabilities and the additionalrevised efforts needed for future vulnerabilities (Few et al., 2006; Krysanova
et al., 2010; Olhoff and Schaer, 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). An important prerequisite for informed decisions on adaptation to
climate change and disaster risk management is that they should bebased upon the best available information (OECD, 2009; Biesbroek et al.,2010; Lu, 2011). Preston et al. (2011) noted that many of the specificadaptation plans from Australia, the United States, and the UnitedKingdom indicated a need for improved gathering and sharing of climateand climate change science information prior to or in conjunction withthe delivery of adaptation actions, perhaps reflecting a preference fordelaying adaptation actions until greater certainty or better informationon different adaptation actions was known. As noted in Chapter 3(Section 3.2.3 and Box 3-2), many extreme events occur at small
temporal and spatial scales, where climate change models, even when
downscaled, cannot provide simulations at such spatial and temporalresolutions. A number of studies also contend that increased and betterinformation on climate change scenarios and projections and potentialimpacts will accomplish little on their own to mainstream and alteron-the-ground decisions, policies, and plans unless the informationprovided can directly meet decisionmakers’ needs (Stainforth et al.,2007; Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Krysanova et al., 2010;Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Users requirerelevant climate risk information that is accessible, can be explained inunderstandable language, provides straightforward estimates ofuncertainties, and is relevant or tailored to their managementfunctions (Stainforth et al., 2007; Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Lu, 2011).Increasingly, studies are showing that this is best accomplishedthrough sustained interactions between scientists and stakeholders andpolicymakers, usually maintained through years of relationship- andtrust-building (Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Lu,2011). 
Studies generally indicate that the most essential means for effectively
mainstreaming both adaptation and disaster risk management nationallyinvolve ‘whole of government’ coordination across different levels andsectors of governance, including the involvement of a broad range ofstakeholders (Few et al., 2006; Thomalla et al., 2006; OECD, 2009; alsoSection 6.4.2). In spite of the strong interdependencies, governments havetended to manage these issues in their ‘silos’ with environment or energyauthorities and scientific institutions typically responsible for climatechange adaptation while disaster risk management authorities mayreside in a variety of national government departments and nationaldisaster management offices (Sperling and Szekely, 2005; Thomalla etal., 2006; Prabhakar et al., 2009). Progress in planning for adaptation anddeveloping and implementing strategies within government agenciesusually depends on political commitment, institutional capacity, and, insome cases, on enabling legislation, regulations, and financial support(Few et al., 2006; OECD, 2009; Krysanova et al., 2010; see Section 6.4).Nationally, studies indicate that it may be important to clearly identifya lead for disaster and climate risk reduction efforts where that lead hasinfluence on budgeting and planning processes (Few et al., 2006; OECD,2009). In some cases, countries and regions may be able to build onphases of raised awareness and increased attention to disaster risk inorder to develop and strengthen their responsible institutions (Few etal., 2006; Krysanova et al., 2010). 
Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters357While developed countries may be more financially equipped to meet
many of the challenges of mainstreaming adaptation and disaster riskreduction into national plans and policies, the situation is often morechallenging in developing countries (Krysanova et al., 2010). Nonetheless,there are examples from developing countries where adaptation toclimate change and disaster risk management mainstreaming issueshave been priorities for many years and significant progress inmainstreaming has been noted (e.g., the Caribbean MainstreamingAdaptation to Climate Change project, which was implemented from 2004to 2007; Case Studies 9.2.9 and 9.2.12). In other cases, internationalfunding mechanisms such as the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Fund,the Special Climate Change Fund, the Multi-donor Trust Fund on ClimateChange, and the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience under theClimate Investment Fund are making funding and resources available todeveloping countries to pilot and mainstream changing climate risksand resilience into core development and as an incentive for scaled-upaction and transformational change, although needs exceed availabilityof funds (O’Brien et al., 2008; Krysanova et al., 2010; see Sections7.4.3.3 and 7.4.2 for additional discussion).
6.3.3. Sector-Based Risk Management and Adaptation 
The challenge for countries is to manage short-term climate variabilitywhile also ensuring that different sectors and systems remain resilientand adaptable to changing extremes and risks over the long term(Füssel, 2007; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). The requirement is to balance theshort-term and the longer-term actions needed to resolve the underlyingcauses of vulnerability and to understand the nature of changing climatehazards (UNFCCC, 2008a; OECD, 2009). Achieving adaptation anddisaster risk management objectives while attaining human developmentgoals requires a number of cross-cutting, interlinked sectoral anddevelopment processes, as well as effective strategies within sectorsand coordination between sectors (Few et al., 2006; Thomalla et al.,2006; Biesbroek et al., 2010). Climate change is far too big a challengefor any single ministry of a national government to undertake (CCCD,2009; Biesbroek et al., 2010). 
Sector-based organizations and departments play a central role in
national decisionmaking and are a logical focus for adaptation actions
(McGray et al., 2007; Biesbroek et al., 2010). The impacts of changing
climate risks in one sector, such as tourism, can affect other sectors andscales significantly, especially since sectoral linkages operate both
vertically and horizontally. Sector plans, policies, and programs are
linked vertically from national to local levels within the same sector as
well as horizontally across different sectors at the same level (Urwin
and Jordan, 2008; UNFCCC, 2008b; CCCD, 2009; Biesbroek et al., 2010).While the case and need for integration within sectors and levels may
be clear, the issue of how to integrate or mainstream nationally across
multiple sectors and multiple levels still remains challenging, requiring
governance mechanisms and coordination that can cut across
governments and sectoral organizations (UNISDR, 2005; UNFCCC,2008b; CCCD, 2009; ONERC, 2009; Biesbroek et al., 2010). Typically,multi-sector integration tends to deal with the broader national scale
(e.g., entire economy or system) and aims to be as comprehensive aspossible in covering several affected sectors, regions, and issues (UNFCCC,2008b). Studies from organizations and academia indicate that effectiveadaptation and risk reduction coordination between all sectors mayonly be realized if all areas of government are coordinated from thehighest political and organizational level (Schipper and Pelling, 2006;UNFCCC, 2008b; CCCD, 2009; Prabhakar, 2009). Even when ‘politicalchampions’ at the highest levels encourage mainstreaming across sectors
and departments, competing national priorities will remain an impedimentto progress.
Table 6-1 (Section 6.3.1) outlines adaptation to climate change and
disaster risk management options for several selected sectors. As thetable indicates, adaptation and disaster risk management approachesfor many development sectors benefit jointly from ecosystem-basedadaptation and integrated land, water, and coastal zone managementactions. For example, conservation and sustainable management ofecosystems, forests, land use, and biodiversity have the potential to createwin-win disaster risk protection services for agriculture, infrastructure,cities, water resource management, and food security. They can alsocreate synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigationmeasures (SCBD, 2009; CCCD, 2009), as well as produce many co-benefits that address other development goals, including improvementsin livelihoods and human well being, particularly for the poor andvulnerable, and biodiversity conservation, and are discussed further inSection 6.5.2.3 and in Case Studies 9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.2.5, 9.2.7, 9.2.8, and9.2.9. Likewise, water resource, land, and coastal zone managementoptions deal with many sectors and issues and jointly provide disasterrisk management and adaptation solutions, as mentioned in Case Studies9.2.6 and 9.2.8 (WHO, 2003; Urwin and Jordan, 2008; UNFCCC, 2008b;CCCD, 2009; WWAP , 2009). Human health is a cross-cutting issueimpacted by actions taken in many sectors, as indicated in Table 6-1 anddiscussed in Case Studies 9.2.2 and 9.2.7. 
6.4. Strategies including Legislation,
Institutions, and Finance
National systems for managing the risks of extreme events and disasters
are shaped by legislative provision, compliance mechanisms, the natureof cross-stakeholder bodies, and financial and budgetary processes thatallocate resources to actors working at different scales. These elementshelp to create the technical architecture of national systems and are oftenled by national government agencies. However non-technical dimensionsof good governance, such as the distribution and decentralization ofpower and resources, processes for decisionmaking, transparency, andaccountability are woven into the technical architecture and are significantfactors in determining the effectiveness of risk management systemsand actions (UNDP , 2004b, 2009). These technical and non-technicalaspects of risk governance vary between countries as governancecapacity varies (and, as detailed in Section 6.3, are critical in shapinginvestment in particular adaptation and disaster risk managementChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters358options). Accordingly, risks can be addressed through both formal and
informal governance modes and institutions in all countries (Jasparsand Maxwell, 2009), but a clear correlation between particular riskgovernance models and specific political-administrative contexts isdifficult to identify (UNISDR, 2011a). The balance between formal orinformal, or technical and non-technical, risk governance strategiesdepends on the economic, political, and environmental contexts ofindividual countries or scales within countries, and the culture ofmanaging risks (Menkhaus, 2007; Kelman, 2008). 
6.4.1. Legislation and Compliance Mechanisms
Disaster risk management legislation commonly establishes organizationsand their mandates, clarifies budgets, provides (dis)incentives, anddevelops compliance and accountability mechanisms (UNDP , 2004b;Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). Creating and improving legislation for disasterrisk reduction was included as a priority area in the HFA (UNISDR, 2005)and the majority of countries – in excess of 80% – now have some formof disaster risk management legislation (UNISDR, 2005; Bhavnani et al.,2008). Legislation continues to be considered as an important componentof effective national disaster risk management systems (UNDP , 2004b;UNISDR, 2011a) as it creates the legal context of the enabling environmentin which others, working at different scales, can act, and it helps todefine people’s rights to protection from disasters, assistance, andcompensation (Pelling and Holloway, 2006). Multi-stakeholder, cross-sector bodies for coordinating disaster risk management actions andimplementing the HFA, known commonly as National Platforms, areseen as key advocacy routes for achieving new and improved legislation(UNISDR, 2005, 2007b). Where National Platforms are less prevalent orless well organized, literature suggests that regional disaster managementbodies are viewed as responsible for advancing legislation (Pelling andHolloway, 2006; UNISDR, 2007b). With new information on the impactsof climate change, legislation on managing disaster risk may need to bemodified and strengthened to reflect changing rights and responsibilitiesand to support the uptake of adaptation options (UNDP , 2009; Llosa andZodrow, 2011; see Case Study 9.2.12 on legislation). 
There have been few detailed cross-comparative studies that assess the
extent to which legislation in different countries is oriented toward
managing uncertainty and reducing disaster risk compared with disasterresponse (Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). Limited evidence suggests that
legislation in some countries (such as the United Kingdom, the United
States, and Indonesia) has led to a focus on building institutional capacity
to help create resilience to disasters at different scales, but even in suchcases a strongly reactive culture is retained when observing the system
as a whole (O’Brien and Read, 2005, O’Brien, 2006, 2008; UNDP , 2009;O’Brien and O’Keefe, 2010). This has been attributed to lack of politicalwill and insufficient financial and human resources for disaster risk
reduction (O’Brien 2006, 2008). Additionally, few studies have assessed
whether disaster risk management legislation includes provision for the
impact of climate change on disaster risk or whether aspects of managingdisaster risk are included in other complementary pieces of legislation(Case Study 9.2.12; Llosa and Zodrow, 2011), though there are also a very
limited number of normative studies on these aspects (Llosa and Zodrow,2011). However, where reforms of disaster management legislationhave occurred, they have tended to: (a) demonstrate a transition fromemergency response to a broader treatment of managing disaster risk;(b) recognize that protecting people from disaster risk is at least partlythe responsibility of governments; and (c) promote the view that reducingdisaster risk is everyone’s responsibility (Case Study 9.2.12; UNDP ,2004b; Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). 
Vietnam has taken steps to integrate disaster risk management into
legislation across key development sectors, including its Land Use Lawand Law on Forest Protection. Vietnam’s Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper also included a commitment to reduce by 50% those falling backinto poverty as a result of disasters and other risks (Pelling and Holloway,2006). Case Study 9.2.12, in examining legislation developmentprocesses in the Philippines and South Africa, highlights a number ofcomponents of effective disaster risk management legislation. Anact needs to be: (a) comprehensive and overarching; (b) establishmanagement structures and secure links with development processes atdifferent scales; and (c) establish participation and accountabilitymechanisms that are based on information provision and effectivepublic awareness and education. Box 6-1 supplements these cases withreflections on the process that led to the creation of disaster riskmanagement legislation in Indonesia.
Where risk management dimensions are a feature of national legislation,
positive changes are not always guaranteed (UNDP , 2004b). A lack offinancial, human, or technical resources and capacity constraints presentsignificant obstacles to full implementation, especially as experiencesuggests that legislation should be implemented continuously from thenational to local level and is contingent on strong monitoring andenforcement frameworks and adequate decentralization of responsibilitiesand human and financial resources at every scale (UNDP , 2004b; Pellingand Holloway, 2006). In some countries, building codes, for instance, areoften not implemented properly because of a lack of technical capacityand political will of officials concerned (UNDP , 2004b). Where enforcementis unfeasible, accountability for disaster risk management actions isextremely challenging; this supports the need for an inclusive, consultativeprocess for discussing and drafting the legislation (UNDP , 2004b;UNISDR, 2007b). Effective legislation includes benchmarks for action, aprocedure for evaluating actions, integrated planning to assist coordinationacross geographical or sectoral areas of responsibility, and a feedbacksystem to monitor risk reduction activities and their outcomes (UNISDR,2005; Pelling and Holloway, 2006). 
6.4.2. Coordinating Mechanisms and Linking across Scales 
As the task of managing the risks of changing climate conditions andclimate extremes and disasters cuts across the majority of sectors andinvolves a wide range of actors, multi-stakeholder and cross-governmentmechanisms are commonly cited as preferred way to ‘organize’ disasterChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters359risk management systems at the national level (UNISDR, 2005, 2007b;
see Section 6.3.3), as well as for addressing the challenges associatedwith adaptation to climate change (ONERC, 2009). The HFA terms these‘National Platforms,’ defined as a “generic term for national mechanismsfor coordination and policy guidance on disaster risk reduction that aremulti-sectoral and inter-disciplinary in nature, with public, private and civilsociety participation involving all concerned entities within a country”(UNISDR, 2005). In some countries such coordinating mechanisms arereferred to by other names (Hay, 2009; Gero et al., 2011) but essentiallyperform the same function. Guidelines on establishing National Platformssuggest that they need to be built on existing relevant systems andshould include participation from different levels of government, key
line ministries, disaster management authorities, scientific and academicinstitutions, civil society, the Red Cross/Red Crescent, the private sector,
opinion shapers, and other relevant sectors associated with disaster
risk management (UNISDR, 2007b). Evaluations and reflections on the
effectiveness of National Platforms for delivering results on the HFA andon disaster risk management more broadly indicate widely varying
results (GTZ/DKKV, 2007; UNISDR, 2007c, 2008c; UNISDR/DKKV/Councilof Europe, 2008; Sharma, 2009). An assessment in Asia foundNational Platforms struggling to obtain the legal mandate to secure full
participation of stakeholders, particularly NGOs, difficulty in obtaining
sustainable funding sources, and challenges associated with translatingintent into implementation (Sharma, 2009). On the other hand, pockets ofevidence exist where National Platforms have succeeded in generatingsenior political commitment for disaster risk reduction, in strengthening
integration of disaster risk reduction into national policy and develop mentplans, and in establishing institutions and programs on disaster risk
management with engagement from academia, media, and the privatesector (UNISDR, 2008b; Sharma, 2009). This assessment found only alimited number of genuinely independent studies on the effectivenessof National Platforms, with evidence particularly weak in Africa andelsewhere. 
While the evidence again suggests significant differences between
countries, on balance, national coordination mechanisms for adaptation toclimate change and disaster risk management remain largely disconnected,although evidence suggests that the trajectory is one of improvement(National Platform for Kenya, 2009; Mitchell et al., 2010b; discussed inChapter 1). Benefits of improved coordination between adaptation toclimate change and disaster risk management bodies, and developmentand disaster management agencies, include the ability to (i) explorecommon tradeoffs between present and future action, includingaddressing human development issues and reducing sensitivity todisasters versus addressing post-disaster vulnerability; (ii) identifysynergies to make best use of available funds for short- to longer-termadaptation to climate risks as well as to tap into additional fundingsources; (iii) share human, information, technical, and practice resources;(iv) make best use of past and present experience to address emergingrisks; (v) avoid duplication of project activities; and (vi) collaborate onreporting requirements (Mitchell and Van Aalst, 2008). Barriers tointegrating disaster risk management and adaptation coordinationmechanisms include the underdevelopment of the ‘preventative’component of disaster risk management, the paucity of projects thatChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
Box 6-1 | Enabling Disaster Risk Management Legislation in Indonesia
Indonesia: Disaster Management Law (24/2007)
The legislative reform process in Indonesia that resulted in the passing of the 2007 Disaster Management Law (24/2007) created a
stronger association between disaster risk management and development planning processes. The process was considered successfuldue to the following factors:
•
Strong, visible professional networks – Professional networks born out of previous disasters meant a high level of trust and
willingness to coordinate and became pillars of the legal reform process. The political and intellectual capital in these netwo rks,
along with leadership from the MPBI (The Indonesian Society for Disaster Management), was instrumental in convincing thelawmakers about the importance of disaster management reform. 
•Civil society leading the advocacy – Civil society leading the advocacy for reform has resulted in CSOs being recognized by the
Law as key actors in implementing disaster risk management in Indonesia.
•The impact of the 2004 South Asian tsunami helping to create a supportive political environment – The reform process was
initiated in the aftermath of the tsunami that highlighted major deficiencies in disaster management. However, the direction of  the
reform (from emergency management toward disaster risk reduction) was influenced by the international focus, through the HFA,on disaster risk reduction. 
•An inclusive drafting process – Consultations on the new Disaster Management Law were inclusive of practitioners and civil
society, but were not so far-reaching as to delay or lose focus on the timetable for reform. 
•Consensus that passing an imperfect law is better than no law at all – An imperfect law can be supplemented by additional
regulations, which helps to maintain interest and focus.

disconnects between different levels of government, and the weaknessof both disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change innational planning and budgetary processes (Few et al., 2006; Mitchelland Van Aalst 2008; Mitchell et al., 2010b) (see Box 6-2).
While national level coordination is important and the majority of risks
associated with disasters and climate extremes are owned by nationalgovernments and are managed centrally (see Section 6.2.1), sourcessuggest that decentralization can be an effective risk managementstrategy, especially in support of community-based disaster riskmanagement processes (Mitchell and Van Aalst, 2008; GNDR, 2009;Scott and Tarazona, 2011). However, there are few studies that criticallyexamine the effectiveness of decentralization of disaster risk managementin detail (Twigg, 2004; Tompkins et al., 2008; Scott and Tarazona, 2011).One such study of four countries – Colombia, Mozambique, Indonesia,and South Africa – found that effective decentralization of disaster riskreduction can be constrained by (a) low capacity at the local level;
(b) funds dedicated to disaster risk reduction often being channeled
elsewhere; (c) the fact that decentralization does not automatically lead
to more inclusive decisionmaking processes; (d) an appreciation that
decentralized systems face significant communications challenges; and
(e) knowledge that robust measures for ensuring accountability and
transparency are vital for effective disaster risk management but are
often missing (Scott and Tarazona, 2011). It appears that motivation for
management at a particular scale promises to influence how well the
impacts of disasters and climate change are managed, and therefore
affect disaster outcomes (Tsing et al., 1999). Decisions made at one scalemay have unintended consequences for another (Brooks and Adger,2005), meaning that governance decisions will have ramifications across
scale and contexts. In all cases, the selection of a framework for
governance of disasters and climate change-related risks may be issue-
or context-specific (Sabatier, 1986). 6.4.3. Finance and Budget Allocation
Governments in the past have ignored catastrophic risks in decisionmaking,implicitly or explicitly exhibiting risk-neutrality (Mechler, 2004). This isconsistent with the Arrow Lind theorem (Arrow and Lind, 1970), accordingto which a government may be well equipped to efficiently (i) pool risksas it possesses a large number of independent assets and infrastructureso that the aggregate risk converges to zero, and/or (ii) spread riskacross the taxpaying population base, so that per capita risk accruing torisk-averse households converges to zero. In line with this theorem, dueto their ability to spread and diversify risks, governments are sometimestermed ‘the most effective insurance instrument of society’ (Priest 1996).Accordingly, it has been deduced that, although individuals are risk-averse [to disasters risk], governments can take a risk-neutral approach.However, the experiences of highly exposed countries suggest otherwiseand have led to a recent paradigm shift, with governments changingfrom being ‘risk neutral’ to being risk averse and managing disaster risks.Many highly exposed developing and developed countries (especially inthe wake of the recent financial crisis) have very limited economicmeans, rely on small and exhausted tax bases, have high levels ofindebtedness, and are unable to raise sufficient and timely capital toreplace or repair damaged assets and restore livelihoods followingmajor disasters. This can lead to increased impacts of disaster shocks onpoverty and development (OAS, 1991; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005;Hochrainer, 2006; Mahul and Ghesquiere, 2007; Cummins and Mahul,2009). Exposed countries thus have had to rely on donors to ‘bail’ themout after events, although ex-post assistance usually only providespartial relief and reconstruction funding, and such assistance is also oftenassociated with substantial time lags (Pollner, 2000; Mechler, 2004). 
Furthermore, extreme events that are associated with large losses may
lead to important downstream economic effects (see Section 4.5),causing depressed incomes and reduced ability to share the losses.Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
Box 6-2 | National and Sub-National Coordination for Managing Disaster Risk
in a Changing Climate: Kenya
Kenya’s National Platform is situated under the Office of the President and has made significant achievements in coordinating m ultiple
stakeholders, but is constrained by limited resources and lack of budgets for disaster risk reduction in line ministries (Natio nal Platform
for Kenya, 2009). Some key constraints of the national system are recognized as being difficulties in integrating disaster risk  reduction in
planning processes in urban and rural areas and lack of data on risks and vulnerabilities at different scales (Few et al., 2006) . In this regard,
Nairobi has experienced periods of drought and heavy rains in the last decade, prompting action to reduce exposure and vulnerab ility to
what is perceived as changing hazard trends (ActionAid, 2006). Increasing exposure and vulnerability has resulted from a rapid expansion
of poor people living in informal settlements around Nairobi, leading to houses of weak building materials being constructed im mediately
adjacent to rivers and blocking natural drainage areas. While data and coordination systems are still lacking, the Government o f Kenya
has established the Nairobi Rivers Rehabilitation and Restoration Programme (African Development Bank Group, 2010), designed toinstall riparian buffers, canals, and drainage channels, while also clearing existing channels. The Programme also targets the urban poor
with improved water and sanitation, paying attention to climate variability and change in the location and design of wastewaterinfrastructure and environment monitoring for flood early warning (African Development Bank Group, 2010). This demonstrates the  kind
of options for investments that can be achieved in the absence of a fully fledged nationally coordinated disaster management sy stem
and in the absence of complete multi-hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data sets.361Consequently, a risk-neutral stance in dealing with catastrophic risk
(implying that the consideration of risk broadly in terms of means – thestatistical expectation – is sufficient) may not be suitable for exposeddeveloping countries with limited diversification of their economies orsmall tax bases. Accordingly, assessing and managing risks over thewhole spectrum of probabilities is gaining momentum (Cardenas et al.,2007; Cummins and Mahul, 2009). As the Organization of American Statessuggests: “Government decisions should be based on the opportunitycosts to society of the resources invested in the project and on the lossof economic assets, functions and products. In view of the responsibilityvested in the public sector for the administration of scarce resources,and considering issues such as fiscal debt, trade balances, incomedistribution, and a wide range of other economic and social, andpolitical concerns, governments should not act risk-neutral” (OAS,1991). Also, in more developed economies, less-pronounced but stillconsiderable effects imposed by events linked to climate variability canbe identified. This has been shown by the Austrian political and fiscal
crisis in the aftermath of large-scale flooding that led to billions of
Euros in losses in 2002 (Mechler et al., 2010). 
Budget and resource planning for extremes is not an easy proposition.
Governments commonly plan and budget for direct liabilities, that is,
liabilities that manifest themselves through certain and annually recur rent
events. Those liabilities are of explicit (as recognized by law or contract),or implicit nature (moral obligations) (see Table 6-2). Yet, governmentsare not good at planning for contingencies even for probable events, letalone improbable events. Explicit, contingent liabilities deal with thereconstruction of infrastructure destroyed by events, whereas implicitobligations are associated with providing relief – commonly consideredas a moral liability for governments (Polackova Brixi and Mody, 2002).In many countries, governments do not explicitly plan for contingentliabilities, and rely on reallocating their resources following disastersand raising capital from domestic and international donations to meetinfrastructure reconstruction needs and costs.
More recently, some developing and transition countries that face large
contingent liabilities in the aftermath of extreme events and associatedfinancial gaps have begun to plan for and consider contingent naturalevents (also see Section 6.5.3). Mexico, Colombia, and many Caribbeancountries now include contingent liabilities in their budgetary processand eventually even transfer some of these risks (Cardenas et al., 2007;Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007; Cummins and Mahul, 2009; seeBox 6-3). Similarly, many countries have also started to focus onimproving human development conditions as an adaptation strategy forclimate change and extreme events, particularly with the help ofinternational agencies such as the World Bank. These deliberations areChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters

6.5. Practices including Methods and Tools
With some success and with many challenges, countries are increasinglyadopting a diverse range of approaches, methods, and tools to manage
disaster risk and adapt to a changing climate, with the intention of
building a safe, secure society. This section discusses efforts made in
building a culture of safety (Section 6.5.1), which includes methods
associated with assessing and communicating risk; reducing climate-
related disaster risks (Section 6.5.2); transferring and sharing residual
risks (Section 6.5.3); and managing the impacts of disasters holistically
(Section 6.5.4), as disaster risks can never be reduced to zero.
Accordingly, it is important to recognize that the approaches, methods,
and tools discussed here are complementary, often overlapping, and
can be pursued simultaneously. Whereas the Summary for Policymakers
includes a visual representation of the range of such approaches (seeFigure SPM-2), Figure 6-3 on the previous page is tailored to incrementalaction at the national level. 
Figure 6-3 characterizes the range of risk management and adaptation
options open to stakeholders involved in national systems for managing
disaster risk. Such options exist along a continuum of action, with
choices between different options being dependent on the qualityof information and how it is communicated, the findings of risk
assess ments, the culture of risk management/acceptability of risk, and
on capacities and resources. In practice, different options will likely bepursued simultaneously and will have a high degree of co-dependence. 
6.5.1. Building a Culture of Safety
Building a culture of safety involves several strategies and activities that
start with the assessment of risk factors and development of information
systems that provide relevant information for critical decisionmaking. It
also involves understanding the large variety of beliefs and core value
systems, which will help determine decisions made by different actors
and stakeholders. A key ingredient is appropriate public education and
awareness raising, and as such, early warning systems play an important
role in managing residual risk as they can provide timely warnings to
exposed communities and thus can promote action for a quick
response. Time series empirical data used to generate risk assessments,
including those contributing to early warnings, are also critical for long-
term planning because of their relevance in generating appropriate
information about adequate land use planning, for example, to reduceclimatic risks. As examples, in the same sense, analyzed informationabout climate-adapted infrastructure, enhanced human development,ecosystems protection, risks transfer, and sharing and managing theimpacts of climate-related disasters can play a fundamental role inbuilding a culture and practice of human safety. Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
Box 6-3 | Mexico’s Fund for Natural Disasters, FONDEN
Mexico is exposed to natural hazards due to its location within one of the world’s most active seismic regions and in the path of
hurricanes and tropical storms originating in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. There have been many disaster events
and in the past severe hurricane disasters (in addition to earthquakes) have created large fiscal liabilities and imbalances (C ardenas et
al., 2007). Given high perceived financial vulnerability to disasters, in 1994, the Mexican Government passed a law that requir ed federal,
state, and municipal public assets to be insured. This was intended to relieve the central government of the obligation of havi ng to pay
for the reconstruction of public infrastructure, although the adequate level of insurance, particularly for very large events r emained a
concern. As a next step, in 1996, the national government established a system of allocating resources for disaster spending (F ONDEN)
in order to enhance the country’s financial preparedness for disaster losses and prevent imbalances in the federal government f inances
derived from outlays caused by catastrophes. FONDEN serves as last-resort funding for uninsurable losses, such as emergency res ponse
and disaster relief expenditures. In addition to this budgetary program, in 1999, a reserve fund was created that accumulates t he surplus
of the previous year’s FONDEN budget item (Cardenas et al., 2007).
After the initial phase that was characterized by spending in line with requirements caused by disaster events, one concern for  the
disaster management authorities became the regular demands on the funds in non-disaster years. As a consequence, budgeted FONDE N
resources were declining while demands on FONDEN’s resources were becoming more volatile, and outlays often exceeded budgetedfunds causing the reserve fund to decline. In 2005, after the severe hurricane season affecting large parts of coastal Mexico, the fund
was finally exhausted. This forced the Mexican Government to look at alternative risk financing strategies, which included hedg ing
against disaster shocks, government agencies at all levels providing their insurance protection independent of FONDEN, and thatFONDEN itself should only indemnify losses that exceed the financial capacity of the federal, local, or municipal government ag encies. In
2006, Mexico became the first transition country to transfer part of its public sector catastrophe risk to the international re insurance and
capital markets, and, in 2009, the transaction was renewed for another three years, covering both hurricane and earthquake risk(Cardenas et al., 2007).3636.5.1.1. Assessing Risks and Maintaining Information Systems
As discussed widely in Chapter 1, the first key step in managing risk is
to assess and characterize it. In terms of risk factors, disaster risk iscommonly defined by three elements: the hazard, exposure of elements,and vulnerability (Swiss Re, 2000; Kuzak, 2004; Grossi and Kunreuther,
2005; CACCA, 2010). Thus, understanding risk involves observing and
recording hazards and hazard analysis, studying exposure and drivers ofvulnerability, and vulnerability assessment. Responding to risks isdependent on the way risk-based information is framed in the contextof public perception and risk management needs. 
Given the ‘public good’ nature of much of disaster-related information
(Benson and Clay, 2004), governments have a fundamental role inproviding good-quality and context-specific risk information about, forexample, the geographical distribution of people, assets, hazards, risks, anddisaster impacts and vulnerability to support disaster risk management(McBean, 2008). Good baseline information and robust time seriesinformation are key for long-term risk monitoring and assessments, notonly for hazards, but also for evaluating the evolution of vulnerability andexposure (McEntire and Myers, 2004; Aldunce and León, 2007). Regularupdating of information about hazards, exposure, and vulnerability arealso necessary because of the dynamic nature of disaster risk, especiallydue to the effects of climate change and the associated uncertainty this
creates (UNISDR, 2004; Prabhakar et al., 2009; CACCA, 2010). 
A key component in the risk assessment process is to determine exposed
elements at risk. This may relate to persons, buildings, infrastructure(e.g., water and sewer facilities, roads, and bridges), agricultural assets,livelihoods, ecosystems, natural infrastructure, and ecosystem servicesin harm’s way that can be impacted in case of a disaster event. Fornational level assessments, their aggregate values are of interest.Ideally, this would be based on national asset inventories, nationalpopulation census, and other national information. In practice, collectingan inventory on assets and their values often proves very difficult andexpensive due to the heterogeneity and sheer number of the examined
elements (see Cummins and Mahul, 2009). In addition, risk management
processes require identifying those elements of the social process thatalso contribute to vulnerability – such as organizational and economiccapacities, human development status of communities at risk, andcapacity to respond to disasters (Lavell, 1996; Cardona et al., 2010) – aswell as assessing the impacts following disaster events (ECLAC, 2003;Benson and Clay, 2004). Considerable progress has been made in thegeneration and use of such information including in some developingcountries (Benson and Clay, 2004; UNISDR 2009c). Nevertheless, inmany countries this is not a regular practice and efforts to document

Regular monitoring of vulnerability is also at a nascent stage (Dilley ,
2006; Cardona et al., 2010). Table 6-3 on the previous page shows asample of the kinds of information required for effective disaster riskmanagement and adaptation to climate change activities. 
Country- and context-specific information on disaster impacts and losses,
including baseline data about observations (different types of losses,weather data) from past events, is often very limited and of mixedquality (see Embrechts et al., 1997; Carter et al., 2007). Data records atbest may date back several decades, and thus often would provideonly one reference data point for extreme events, such as a 100-year event (see Section 3.2.1). Data on losses from extremes can also besystematically biased due to high media attention (Guha-Sapir andBelow, 2002). At times the data on losses are incomplete, as in thePacific small island developing states, because of limited capacity tosystematically collect information at the time of disaster, or because ofinconsistent methodologies and the costs of measures used (Chung,2009; Lal, 2010).
International disaster impact databases are available, such as the EM-
DAT database of the Centre for the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) inBrussels, Desinventar maintained by a network of scientists involvedin studying disasters in Latin America (Red de Estudios Sociales enPrevención de Desastres en América Latina – LA RED), as well asdatabases of reinsurers such as Munich Re. Comparisons of internationaland national disaster loss databases have shown significant variationsin documented losses due to inconsistencies in the definition of keyparameters and estimation methods used. This emphasizes the need tostandardize parameter definitions and estimation methods (Guha-Sapirand Below, 2002; ECLAC, 2003; Tschoegl et al., 2006). For some countries,a reasonable quality and quantity of information may exist on the directimpacts, particularly where the reinsurance industry, consulting firms,and multi-lateral financial institutions have worked together with theresearch communities. Limited information is generally available onsocially relevant effects of disasters, such as the incidence of healtheffects after a disaster as well as the impacts on ecosystems, whichhave not been well studied (Benson and Twigg 2004). Furthermore, the
assessment of indirect disaster impacts on social or economic systems,
such as on income-generating sectors and national savings, needs greaterattention (ECLAC, 2003; Benson and Clay, 2004). Such information canoften also be very useful in order to assess risks by using statistical
estimation techniques (Embrechts et al., 1997) or catastrophe modeling
approaches (Grossi and Kunreuther, 2005).
6.5.1.2. Preparedness: Risk Awareness, Education,
and Early Warning Systems
National governments create the environment and communication
channels to develop and disseminate different kinds of information on, for
example, the hazards that affect different populations and preparednessfor disaster response. Numerous studies indicate that up-to-date androbust early warning systems play a critical role in reducing the impacts
of potential disasters and enable populations to protect lives and someproperty and infrastructure (White et al., 2004; Aldunce and León, 2007;McBean, 2008; Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010), and as illustrated in CaseStudy 9.2.11. 
Traditionally, early warning systems have been interpreted narrowly as
technological instruments for detecting and forecasting impending hazardevents and for issuing alerts (Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). However, thisinterpretation does not clarify whether warning information is receivedby or helpful to the population it serves or is actually used to reducerisks (Basher, 2006; Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). As noted in Case Study9.2.11, the HFA 2005-2015 stated a need for more than just accuratepredictions, stressing that early warning systems should be “peoplecentered” and that warnings need to be “timely and understandable tothose at risk” and include “guidance on how to act upon warnings”(UNISDR, 2005). 
Governments also maintain early warning systems to warn their citizens
and themselves about impending creeping climate- and weather-relatedhazards. For example, ‘early warnings’ of potentially poor seasons havebeen successful at informing key actions for agricultural planning onlonger time scales and for producing proactive responses (Meinke et al.,2006; Vogel and O’Brien, 2006). Case Study 9.2.11 provides examples ofearly warning systems for short-response hazards as well as for creepinghazards operating on time scales from weeks to seasonal. This case studyalso highlights the possibility of using weather and climate predictionsfor timeframes longer than a few days to provide advanced warning ofextreme conditions, which has been only a very recent development.Studies indicate that successful early warning systems are reliant onclose inter-institutional collaboration between national meteorologicaland hydrological services and the agencies that directly intervene inrural areas, such as extension services, development projects, and civilsociety organizations (Meinke et al., 2006; Vogel and O’Brien, 2006;Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010).
An effective early warning system delivers accurate, timely, and meaningful
information, with its success dependent on whether the warnings
trigger effective responses (UNISDR, 2005; Basher, 2006; Gwimbi,2007; Auld, 2008a; van Aalst, 2009; Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010).Warnings fail in both developing and developed countries for a numberof reasons, including inaccurate weather and climate forecasting,public ignorance of prevailing conditions of vulnerability, failure tocommunicate the threat clearly or in time, lack of local organization,and failure of the recipients to understand or believe in the warning orto take suitable action (UNISDR, 2006; Auld, 2008a; Rogers andTsirkunov, 2010). To be effective and complete, an early warning systemtypically is composed of four interacting elements (Basher, 2006;UNISDR, 2006): (1) generation of risk knowledge including monitoringand forecasting; (2) surveillance and warning services; (3) disseminationand communication; and (4) response capability. Warnings are receivedand understood by the target audience and are most relevant when thecommunications have meaning that is shared between those who issueChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters365the forecasts, local knowledge, and the decisionmakers they are intended
to inform (Basher, 2006; UNISDR, 2006; Auld, 2008a; Case Study 9.2.2).Because emergency responders, the media, and the public often areunable to translate the scientific information on forecast hazards inwarnings into risk levels and responses, early warning systems are mosteffective when their users can identify and interpret the general warningmessages into simple and relevant local impacts and actions (e.g., flashflood warning and the need to evacuate areas at risk), prioritize the mostdangerous hazards, assess potential contributions from cumulative andsequential events to risks, and identify thresholds linked to escalatingrisks for infrastructure, communities, and disaster response (UNISDR,2006; Auld, 2008a).
Different hazards and different sectors often require unique preparedness,
warnings, and response strategies (Basher, 2006; UNISDR, 2006). Forexample, the needs and responses behind a warning of a drought, atornado, a cyclone, or a fire are very different. Some hazards mayrepresent singular extreme events, sequences, or compound combinationsof hazards while other hazards can be described as ‘creeping’ oraccumulations of events (or non-events). For example, the WorldMeteorological Organization (WMO), national meteorological andhydrological services, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food andAgriculture Organization (FAO), and others recognize that combinationsof weather and climate hazards can result in complex emergencyresponse situations and are working to establish multi-hazard earlywarning systems for complex risks such as heat waves and vector-bornediseases (UNISDR, 2006; WMO, 2007) and early warnings of pests andfood safety threats and disease outbreaks (e.g., prediction of a potentialdesert locust crisis) (WMO, 2004, 2007; FAO, 2010). Other ‘creeping’hazards can evolve over a period of days to months; floods anddroughts, for example, can result from cumulative or sequential multi-hazard events, especially when accompanied by an already existingvulnerability, while other hazards such as accumulated precipitation canlead to critical infrastructure failure (Basher, 2006; Auld, 2008a; Rogersand Tsirkunov, 2010). Section 3.1.3 provides more detail on compound,multiple, and creeping hazards. 
Studies indicate that an understanding by the public and community
organizations of their risks and vulnerabilities are critical but insufficient
for risk management and that early warning systems need to becomplemented by preparedness programs as well as public educationand awareness programs (Basher, 2006; UNISDR, 2006; Gwimbi, 2007;Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). This requires systematic linkages andintegration between early warning systems and contingency planning
processes (Pelham et al., 2011). For example, a significant long-termsocial protection program known as the Productive Safety NetProgramme (PSNP) was implemented in Ethiopia in 2007 in response toexperiences from a series of drought-related disaster responses duringthe late 1990s and early 2000s (Pierro and Desai, 2008; Conway andSchipper, 2011). The aim of the PSNP was to shift institutional approachesaway from just emergency responses and into more sustainable livelihoodapproaches involving asset protection and food security. Under thisprogram, millions of people in ‘chronically’ food-insecure households inrural Ethiopia received resources from the PSNP through cash transfers
or food payments for their participation in labor-intensive public worksprojects with a particular focus on environmental rehabilitation(Conway and Schipper, 2011). The case study on drought (Case Study9.2.3) also emphasizes the importance of proactive steps in the form ofdrought preparedness and mitigation, and improved monitoring andearly warning systems.
Some studies indicate that public awareness and support for disaster
prevention and preparedness are often high immediately after a majordisaster event and that such moments can be capitalized on to strengthenand secure the sustainability of, for example, early warning systems(Basher, 2006; Rossetto, 2007). It should be noted that such windowsrequire the pre-existence of a social basis for cooperation that, in turn,supports a collaborative framework between research and management(Rossetto, 2007; Tompkins et al., 2008; Pelham et al., 2011).
The timing and form of climatic information (including forecasts and
projections), and access to trusted guidance to help interpret andimplement the information and projections in decisionmaking processes,may be more important to individual users than improved reliability andforecast skill (Pulwarty and Redmond, 1997; Rayner et al., 2005;Gwimbi, 2007; Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010). Decisionmakers typicallymanage risks holistically, while scientific information is generallyderived using reductionist approaches (Meinke et al., 2006). The netoutcome can be a ‘disconnect’ between scientists and decisionmakerswith the result that climate and hydro-meteorological information canbe developed that, although scientifically sound, may lack relevance tothe decisionmaker (Cash and Buizer, 2005; Meinke et al., 2006; Vogel andO’Brien, 2006; Averyt, 2010). Perceptions of irrelevance, inconsistency,confusion, or doubt can delay action (NRC, 2009). Some studies (Lowe,2003; Glantz, 2005; Meinke et al., 2006; Feldman and Ingram, 2009)advise scientists and practitioners to work together to produce trustworthyknowledge that combines scientific excellence with social relevance, apoint also emphasized in Case Study 9.2.2 on fire. These studies suggestthat decision support activities should be driven by users’ needs, not byscientific research priorities, and that these user needs are not alwaysknown in advance, but should be identified collaboratively and iterativelyin ongoing two-way communication between knowledge producers anddecisionmakers (Cash and Buizer, 2005; NRC, 2009). It has beensuggested that this ongoing interaction, two-way communication, andcollaboration allows scientists and decisionmakers to get to know eachother, to develop an understanding of what decisionmakers need toknow and what science can provide, to build trust, and, over time,develop highly productive relationships as the basis for effectivedecision support (Feldman and Ingram, 2009; NRC, 2009; Averyt, 2010). 
Since early warning information systems are multi-jurisdictional and
multidisciplinary, they usually require anticipatory coordination across aspectrum of technical and non-technical actors. National governmentscan play an important role in setting the high-level policies and supportingframeworks involving multiple organizations, in adopting multi-hazardand multi-stakeholder approaches, and in promoting community-based
Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters366early warning systems (Pulwarty et al., 2004; Basher, 2006, UNISDR,
2010). National governments can also interact with regional andinternational governments and agencies to strengthen early warningcapacities and to ensure that warnings and related responses are directedtoward the most vulnerable populations (Basher, 2006; UNISDR, 2010).At the same time, national governments can also play an important rolein supporting regions and sub-national governments in developingoperational and local response capabilities (Basher, 2006; UNISDR,2010; see Section 6.5.4). In Japan and the Mekong region, for example,in addition to using an early warning system based on extensive floodmodeling exercise, the emergency basin-level management relies on theflood mitigation capacity of paddy fields (Masumoto et al., 2006, 2008). 
6.5.2. Reducing Climate-Related Disaster Risk 
National climate-related disaster risk reduction activities include abroad range of options that vary from safe infrastructure and buildingcodes to those aimed to enhance and protect natural ecosystems,support human development and even ‘build back better’ following adisaster. Each of these strategies can prove minimally effective inisolation but highly effective in combination. These and other differentoptions, along with their limitations (e.g. lack of information andunderstanding, human resource capacity, scientific requirements,financing) are addressed in the following subsections, noting how riskreduction measures are increasingly being considered as good practicesto promote adaptation to climate change.
6.5.2.1. Applying Technological
and Infrastructure-Based Approaches
Climate change has the potential to directly and indirectly impact the
safety of existing infrastructure and to alter engineering and maintenancepractices, and will require changes in building codes and standardswhere they exist (Bourrelier et al., 2000; Füssel, 2007; Wilby, 2007; Auld,2008b; Stevens, 2008; Hallegatte, 2009). The changing climate also hasthe potential regionally to increase premature deterioration and
weathering impacts on the built environment, exacerbating vulnerabili ties
to climate extremes and disasters and negatively impacting the expected
and useful life spans of structures (Auld, 2008b; Larsen et al., 2008;Stewart et al., 2011). As noted in Case Study 9.2.8, people living withun-adapted and inadequate infrastructure and housing will be more at
risk from climate change.
With projected increases in the magnitude and/or frequency of some
extreme events in many regions (see Chapter 3), small increases in climateextremes above thresholds or regional infrastructure ‘tipping points’
have the potential to result in large increases in damages to all forms ofexisting infrastructure nationally and to increase disaster risks (Coleman,2002; Munich Re, 2005; Auld, 2008b; Larsen et al., 2008; Kwadijk et al.,2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010).  Since infrastructure systems, such as
buildings, water supply, flood control, and transportation networksoften function as a whole or not at all, an extreme event that exceeds
an infrastructure design or ‘tipping point’ can sometimes result inwidespread failure and a potential disaster (Ruth and Coelho, 2007;Haasnoot et al., 2009). For example, a break in a water main, di ke, or
bridge can impact other systems and sectors and render the regionalsystem incapable of providing needed services (Ruth and Coelho, 2007).These infrastructure thresholds or adaptation ‘tipping points’ becomeimportant when considering sensitivities to climate change andadaptation and disaster risk reduction options for the future (seeSection 6.6.1 for further discussion on thresholds and management ofclimate change uncertainties). Infrastructure thresholds refer here to thecritical climate conditions where acceptable technical, economic, spatial,or societal limits are exceeded and the current built environment systemis no longer “future climate proof” (i.e., it fails, requiring proactiveadaptation actions and changes in infrastructure codes, standards, andmanagement processes) (Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Kwadijk etal., 2010; Mastrandrea et al., 2010).
The need to address the risk of climate extremes and disasters in the
built environment and urban areas, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, is one that is not always fully appreciated by manynational governments and development and disaster specialists(Rossetto, 2007; Moser and Satterthwaite, 2008). Low- and middle-income countries, which account for close to three-quarters of theworld’s urban populations, are at greatest risk from extreme events andalso have far less capacity than do high-income countries, largely due tobacklogs in protective infrastructure and services and limitations in urbangovernment (Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Moser and Satterthwaite, 2008).Rapid growth and expansion in urban areas, particularly in developingcountries, can outpace infrastructure development and lead to a lack ofinfrastructure services for housing, sewer systems, effective transportation,and emergency response and increased vulnerability to weather andclimate extremes (Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Birkmann et al., 2011).These impacts from the changing climate will be particularly severe forpopulations living in poor-quality housing on illegally occupied land,where there is little incentive for investments in more resilient buildingsor infrastructure and service provision (Freeman and Warner, 2001;Satterthwaite et al., 2007; Birkmann et al., 2011). Case Study 9.2.8provides further discussion on the best adaptation and risk managementpractices for cities and their built environment.
An inevitable result of potentially increased damages to infrastructure
will be a dramatic increase in the national resources needed to restoreinfrastructure and assist the poor affected by damaged infrastructure(Freeman and Warner, 2001). A study by the Australian Academy ofTechnological Sciences and Engineering concluded that national retrofitmeasures will be needed to safeguard existing infrastructure in Australiaand new adaptation approaches and national codes and standards willbe required for construction of new infrastructure (Stevens, 2008).Recommendations reported from this study call for research to fill gapson the future climate risks, comprehensive risk assessments for existingcritical climate-sensitive infrastructure, development of information andsupporting tools (e.g., non-stationary extreme value analysis methods)Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters367about future climate change events, investigation of the links between
soft and hard engineering solutions, and strengthened research effortsto improve the modeling of small-scale climate events (Wilby, 2007;Auld, 2008b; Stevens, 2008). 
The recommended national adaptation options to deal with projected
impacts to the built environment range from deferral of actions pendingdevelopment of new climate change information to modification ofinfrastructure components according to national guidance, acceptance ofresidual losses, reliance on insurance and other risk transfer instruments,formalized asset management and maintenance, mainstreaming intoenvironmental assessments, new structural materials and practices,improved emergency services, and retrofitting and replacement ofinfrastructure elements (Bourrelier et al., 2000; Auld, 2008b; Stevens,2008; Haasnoot et al., 2009; Hallegatte, 2009; Neumann, 2009; Kwadijket al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). 
Strategic environmental assessment approaches, such as those
recommended by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) and many national environmental assessmentagencies, offer an effective means for ensuring that adaptation to climate
change and disaster risk management, as well as GHG reduction prac tices,
are mainstreamed into policies and planning for new programs oninfrastructure and systems (OECD, 2006; Benson, 2007). Environmentalimpact assessment approaches can reduce the risks of environmentaldegradation from a project and reduce future disaster risks from currentand changing climate conditions (Benson, 2007). For long-livedinfrastructure or networks, studies recommend consideration of likelyclimate change impacts that will potentially affect the planned usefullife of the infrastructure system (e.g., seasonal variability in water flows,temperatures, incidence of extreme weather events) (OECD, 2006;Bosher et al., 2007; Auld, 2008b; Larsen et al., 2008; Neumann, 2009;NRTEE, 2009).
The implementation of adequate national building codes that incorporate
up-to-date regionally specific climate data and analyses can improveresilience of infrastructure for many types of weather-related risks(Auld, 2008b; WWC, 2009; Wilby et al., 2009). Typically, infrastructurecodes and standards in most countries use historical climate analyses to
climate-proof new structures, assuming that the past climate can beextrapolated to represent the future. For example, water-related
engineering structures, including both disaster-proofed infrastructure
and services infrastructure (e.g., water supply, irrigation and drainage,sewerage, and transportation), are typically designed using analysis ofhistorical rainfall records (Ruth and Coelho, 2007; Auld, 2008b;
Haasnoot et al., 2009; Hallegatte, 2009; Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Sinceinfrastructure is built for long life spans and the assumption of climate
stationarity will not hold for future climates, it is important that national
climate change guidance, tools, and consistent adaptation options bedeveloped to ensure that climate change can be incorporated into
infrastructure design (Auld, 2008b; Stevens, 2008; Hallegatte, 2009;Wilby et al., 2009). While some government departments responsible for
building regulations and the insurance industry are taking the reality ofclimate change very seriously, challenges remain about how to
incorporate the uncertainty of future climate projections into engineeringrisk management and into codes and standards, especially for climateelements such as extreme winds and extreme precipitation and theirvarious phases (e.g., short- and long-duration rainfalls, freezing rain,snowpacks) (Sanders and Phillipson, 2003; Auld, 2008b; Haasnoot et al.,2009; Hallegatte, 2009; Kwadijk et al., 2010; Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Lu,2011). Recent advances in characterizing the uncertainties of climatechange projections, in regionalization of climate model outputs, and inthe application and mainstreaming of integrated top-down, bottom-upapproaches for assessing impacts and adaptation options (Sections6.3.1 and 6.3.2) will help to ensure that infrastructure and technologycan be better adapted to a changing climate. Sections 3.2.3, 3.3, and 3.4provide further details on scientific advances for the construction,assessment, and communication of climate change projections, includinga discussion on recent advances in the development of regionalizationor downscaling techniques and approaches used to quantify uncertaintiesin climate change model outputs.
Some implementation successes are emerging. In one exampl e, dis cussed
in Case Study 9.2.10, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and itsNational Permafrost Working Group developed a Technical Guide, CSAPlus 4011-10, on Infrastructure in Permafrost: A Guideline for Climate
Change Adaptation , that directly incorporated climate change tempera ture
projections from an ensemble of climate change models. This CSA Guideconsidered climate change projections of temperature and precipitationand incorporated risks from warming and thawing permafrost tofoundations over the planned life spans of the structure (Hayley andHorne, 2008; NRTEE, 2009; CSA, 2010a; Smith et al., 2010; Grosse et al.,2011). The guide suggested possible adaptation options, taking intoaccount the varying levels of risks and the consequences of failure forfoundations of structures, whether buildings, water treatment plants,towers, tank farms, tailings ponds, or other infrastructure (NRTEE, 2009;CSA, 2010a; see Case Study 9.2.10). Similarly, working with the Canadianmeteorological service, engineering associations, and national waterstakeholder associations, the CSA has also developed an initial rainfallIntensity-Duration-Frequency Guideline for water practitioners withadaptation guidance (CSA, 2010b). 
In developing countries, structures are often built using prevalent local
practices, which may not reflect best practices from disaster risk reductionor adaptation perspectives. These prevalent local practices usually donot include the use of national building standards or adequatelyaccount for local climate conditions (Rossetto, 2007).
While t he perception
in some developing countries is that national building codes and stan dards
are too expensive, experience in the implementation of incrementalhazard -proof measures in building structures has proven in some countries
to be relatively inexpensive and highly beneficial in reducing losses(Rossetto, 2007; ProVention, 2009). In reality, the most expensivecomponents of codes and standards are usually the cost to implementnational policies for inspections, knowledge transfer to trades, andnational efforts for their uptake and implementation (Rossetto, 2007).Bangladesh, for example, has implemented simple modifications toChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters368improve the cyclone resistance of (non-masonry) kutcha or temporary
houses, with costs that amounted to only 5% of the construction costs(Lewis and Chisholm, 1996; Rossetto, 2007). Bangladesh is alsodeveloping national policies requiring that houses built followingdisasters include a small section of the replacement house that meets‘climate proofing’ standards and acts as a household shelter in the nextdisaster. In many countries, climate-proofing guidelines and standardsare applied to structures that are used as emergency shelters and forstructures that form the economic and social lifeline of a society, suchas its communications links, hospitals, and transportation networks(Rossetto, 2007). 
Many studies advocate that technical and infrastructure solutions are
not the only way of adapting to changing climates and that ‘softsolutions’ such as financial tools, land use planning, and ecosystemconservation or soft engineering approaches are also needed (Adger etal., 2007; Auld, 2008b; Nicholls et al., 2008; Hallegatte, 2009; McEvoy etal., 2010). Land and water use planning, use of bioshields as naturalbuffers, soft defenses, and green or ‘soft engineering’ are complemen tary
adaptation options, described further in Section 6.5.2.3 and in CaseStudies 9.2.1 and 9.2.8.
6.5.2.2. Human Development and Vulnerability Reduction
Vulnerabilities to climate-related hazards and the options to reducethem vary between and within countries due to factors such as poverty,social positioning, geographic location, gender, age, class, ethnicity,ecosystem condition, community structure, community decisionmakingprocesses, and political issues (Yodmani, 2001; Yamin et al., 2005;Halsnaes and Traerup, 2009). Overall, studies indicate that the extent ofthe vulnerability to climate variability and climate change is shaped byboth the dependence of the national economy and livelihoods on climate-sensitive natural resources and the resilience or robustness of thecountry’s social institutions to equitable distribution of resources underclimate change (Ikeme, 2003; Brooks et al., 2009; Virtanin et al., 2011).The poorest regions are often characterized by vulnerable housing, weakemergency services and infrastructure, and a dependence on agriculture
and other natural resources (Ikeme, 2003; Manuel-Navarrete et al.,
2007; Reid et al., 2010).
Many vulnerable communities already suffer greater water stress, food
insecurity, disease risks, and loss of livelihoods, which have the potentialto increase under climate change (Manuel-Navarrete et al., 2007; Brookset al., 2009; Halsnaes and Traerup, 2009; Virtanin et al., 2011). Forexample, climate change may increase the risk of waterborne diseases,
requiring targeted assistance for health and water sanitation issues(Curriero et al., 2001; Brooks et al., 2009). Small island states and low-lying countries may require support to relocate vulnerable groups to
safer locations or other countries, all requiring a complex set of actions
at the national and international levels (Manuel-Navarrete et al., 2007;
McGranahan et al., 2007). Other studies indicate that resilient housing and
safe shelters will remain a key adaptation action to protect vulnerablepeople from disasters and climate extremes, requiring national guidelines
to ensure that new or replacement structures are built with flexibility toaccommodate future changes (Ikeme, 2003; Manuel-Navarrete et al.,2007; Rossetto, 2007; Auld, 2008b). Under climate change, it is expectedthat food security issues among vulnerable populations will becomemore impacted by climate variability, erratic rainfall, and more frequentextreme events (Ikeme, 2003; IRI, 2006; Brooks et al., 2009; Halsnaesand Traerup, 2009; and regional studies through global partnerships,such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research).When faced with food scarcity, vulnerable populations sometimes adoptmaladaptive coping strategies such as overgrazing, deforestation, andunsustainable extraction of water resources that aggravate long-termdisaster risks (Brooks et al., 2009; Bunce et al., 2010). 
Studies indicate that the greatest losses in suitable agricultural cropland
due to climate change are likely to be in Africa, particularly sub-SaharanAfrica (Ikeme, 2003; FAO, 2010). Assessing food security issues in thisvulnerable area requires consideration of multiple socioeconomic andenvironmental variables, including climate (Verdin et al., 2005; Virtaninet al., 2011). In sub-Saharan Africa, where large and widely dispersedpopulations depend on rain-fed agriculture and pastoralism, climatemonitoring and forecasting are important inputs to food security analysisand assessments. Since conventional climate and hydro-meteorologicalnetworks in these areas are sparse and often report with significant delays,there is a growing need for increased capacity in rainfall observations,forecasting, data management, and modeling applications (Verdin etal., 2005; Heltberg et al., 2009; FAO, 2010). Studies indicate a need forrainfall observation networks to be expanded and to incorporate satel lite
information; for data management systems to be improved; for tailoredforecast information to be disseminated and used by decisionmakers;and for more effective early warning systems that can integrate seasonalforecasts with drought projections as inputs for hazards, food security,and vulnerability analysis (Verdin et al., 2005; Heltberg et al., 2009; FAO,2010). Other short-term but limited strategies to minimize food securityrisks include diversifying livelihoods to spread risk, farming in differentecological niches, building social networks, productive safety net andsocial protection schemes, and risk pooling at the regional or nationallevel to reduce financial exposure (Brooks et al., 2009; Halsnaes andTraerup, 2009; Heltberg et al., 2009; FAO, 2010). Specific longer-termstrategies to address the increasing risks, particularly given uncertainties,include land rehabilitation, terracing and reforestation, measures toenhance water catchment and irrigation techniques, improvements toinfrastructure quality for better access to markets, and the introductionof drought-resistant crop varieties (Halsnaes and Traerup, 2009;Heltberg et al., 2009). 
In the longer term, studies indicate that increasing food security risks
under climate change will require higher agricultural productivity, reducedproduction variability, and agricultural systems that are more resilientto disruptive events (Cline, 2007; Stern, 2007; Halsnaes and Traerup,2009; FAO, 2010). This implies transformations in the management ofnatural resources; new climate-smart agriculture policies, practices, andtools; better use of climate science information in assessing risks andChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters369vulnerability; and financing for food security (Brooks et al., 2009;
Ericksen et al., 2009; FAO, 2010). Other coping strategies may includeincreased non-farm incomes, migration, government and other financialassistance, microfinance, social protection, other safety nets, andvarious insurance products (Barrett et al., 2007; Heltberg et al., 2009;FAO, 2010). The Sustainable Livelihoods Approach or Framework has beenused internationally for rural and coastal development to holisticallydescribe the variables that impact livelihoods locally and to define thecapacity, assets (both natural and social), and policies required forsustainable living, poverty reduction, and recovery from disasters(Brocklesby and Fisher, 2003; Yamin et al., 2005). Sections 2.3, 2.4.3,2.6.1, 5.2.3, and 5.4, and Case Studies 19.2.1 and 19.2.2, also discusssustainable livelihood approaches that can be considered inbuilding adaptive capacity and resilience to climate hazards and climatechange. 
Early identification of populations at risk can enable timely and
appropriate actions needed to avert widespread impacts. Reliable anddetailed information on the current and future climates and theirimpacts can play an important role in the recognition of the need toadapt and the successful evolution of effective adaptation strategies(Ikeme, 2003; Verdin et al., 2005; Heltberg et al., 2009; Wilby et al., 2009;and as discussed in Section 6.5.1). Some studies claim that one of thepotential barriers for identifying the most vulnerable regions and peoplein developing countries under future climate change is the limitedhuman resource capacity regionally to downscale global and regionalclimate projections to a scale suitable to support national-level planningand programming processes (Ikeme, 2003; Verdin et al., 2005; CCCD,2009; Wilby et al., 2009). Not all of the climate variables of importancefor development can be projected and downscaled with confidence,particularly given that many development activities are especiallysensitive to changes in climate extremes (Agrawala and van Aalst,2008). Even when downscaled results are available, their use can belimited by a lack of understanding and interpretation of how thesedownscaled projections can be translated to highlight vulnerabilitieswith certainty (Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009).Agrawala and van Aalst (2008) argue that development practitionersand climate scientists should join forces to make climate information
more accessible, relevant, and usable.
Because the risks posed by climate change can affect the long-term
efficiency with which development resources can be invested and
development objectives achieved, studies indicate that it remains
important to integrate or mainstream disaster risk management andclimate change adaptation into a range of development activities
(Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Halsnaes and Traerup, 2009; Heltberget al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2010a). Lack of awareness within the
development community of the many implications of climate change
and limitations on resources for implementation are frequently cited
reasons for difficulties in mainstreaming adaptation and disaster risk
management (Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009; alsosee Section 6.3.2). Adaptation to climate change and disaster risk
management actions can be considered to be successfully mainstreamedwhen they reduce the vulnerability of susceptible populations to existing
climate variability and are also able to strengthen the capacity of thepopulation to prepare for and respond to further changes (Yamin et al.,2005; Manuel-Navarrete et al., 2007; Mertz et al., 2009). Studies indicatethat national policies can increase this capacity (Ikeme, 2003; Heltberget al., 2009). Policies and measures such as the establishment of anLDC fund, Special Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, climate change Multi-Donor Trust Fund, etc., have all been developed to address the specialadaptation and risk reduction issues of vulnerable countries (seeSections 7.4.2 and 7.4.3.3 for more details). 
In spite of recommendations to target assistance to the most vulnerable
in the developing world, practical ‘on the ground’ examples have beenlimited (Yamin et al., 2005; Ayers and Huq, 2009; Heltberg et al.,2009). Nonetheless, some developing countries have implemented
successful policies and plans. Nationally, good progress is being made
in strengthening some disaster reduction capacities for disasterpreparedness and early warning and response systems and in addressingsome of the underlying risk drivers in many developing country regionsand sectors (Manuel-Navarrete et al., 2007; UNISDR, 2009c). For example,social safety nets and other similar national-level programs, particularlyfor poverty reduction and attainment of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals, have helped the poorest to reduce their exposure to current andfuture climate hazards (Yamin et al., 2005; Tanner and Mitchell 2008;Heltberg et al., 2009). Some examples of social safety nets are cashtransfers to the most vulnerable, versions of weather-indexed cropinsurance, employment guarantee schemes, and asset transfers (Yaminet al., 2005; CCCD, 2009; also see Section 6.6.3). A national policy tohelp the vulnerable build assets should incorporate climate screening inorder to remain resilient under a changing climate (UNISDR, 2004;
Tanner and Mitchell, 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009). Other measures, such
as social pensions that transfer cash from the national level to vulnerablepeople, provide some buffers against climate hazards (Davies et al., 2008;Heltberg et al., 2009). However, lack of capacity and good governancehas remained a major barrier to efficient and effective delivery of
assistance to the most vulnerable (Yamin et al., 2005; CCCD, 2009;
Heltberg et al., 2009; Warner et al., 2009).
National Adaptation Programme of Actions (NAPA) under the UNFCCC
process have helped least-developed countries assess the climate-sensitive sectors and prioritize projects to address the most urgentadaptation issues of the most vulnerable regions, communities, andpopulations. The NAPA process has proven instrumental in increasingawareness of climate change and its potential impacts in the poorestcountries. The proposed adaptation projects under the NAPA usuallycover small areas and address a few components within a given sectorwith a view to addressing urgent and immediate needs. The choice ofprojects is based on the urgency of the actions as well as cost-effective ness
in cases where delays would increase the costs of later addressing theissue. Assessment of completed NAPAs show different national andregional priority sectors such as health, food security, infrastructure,coastal zone and marine ecosystem, insurance, early warning and disastermanagement, terrestrial ecosystem, education and capacity building,
Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters370tourism, energy, water resources, and cross-sectoral areas. The NAPA
process forms a good basis for developing medium- and long-termadaptation plans and policies. The capacity within NAPA teams and thesubsequent networks that are created are proving very useful in thedesign of broader national adaptation plans (UNFCCC, 2011a,b).
6.5.2.3. Investing in Natural Capital
and Ecosystem-Based Adaptation
Ecosystem-based adaptation, which integrates the use of biodiversity
and ecosystem services into an overall adaptation strategy, can be a cost-effective strategy for responding to the effects of weather and climateextremes (SCBD, 2009). It is generally agreed that investment in sustainable
ecosystems and environmental management has the potential to also
provide improved livelihoods and increased biodiversity conservation(Bouwer, 2006; UNEP , 2006, 2010; McGray et al., 2007; Colls et al.,2009; SCBD, 2009; Sudmeier-Rieux and Ash, 2009; World Bank, 2009). 
Healthy, natural or modified, ecosystems (see Section 6.3.1 and Box 6-4)
have a critical role to play in reducing risks of climate extremes anddisasters (Sidle et al., 1985; Dorren et al., 2004; Phillips and Marden,2005; Reid and Huq, 2005; UNISDR, 2005, 2007a,b, 2009a,b; Bebi et al.,2009; Colls et al., 2009; SCBD, 2009; Sudmeier-Rieux and Ash, 2009;UNEP , 2009; Lal, 2010). Although the scientific evidence base relatingto the role of ecosystem services in reducing the sensitivity of naturalsystems to weather and climate extremes and reducing vulnerabilitiesto many disasters is nascent, investment in natural ecosystemmanagement has long been used to reduce risks of disasters (see Box6-4). Forests, for example, have been used in the Alps and elsewhere aseffective risk-reducing measures against avalanches, rockfalls, andlandslides since the 1900s (Sidle et al., 1985; Dorren et al., 2004; Phillipsand Marden, 2005; Bebi et al., 2009). The damage caused by wildfires,wind erosion, drought, and desertification are reported to have beenbuffered by forest management, shelterbelts, greenbelts, hedges, andother ‘living fences’ (ProAct Network, 2008; Dudley et al., 2010).Mangrove replanting has been used as a buffer against cyclones andstorm surges, with reports of a 70 to 90% reduction in energy from
wind-generated waves in coastal areas (UNEP , 2006) and reduction inthe number of deaths from cyclones (Das and Vincent, 2009), dependingon the health and extent of the mangroves. Many sectoral examplesare provided in Table 6-1 that also provide evidence of the value of
ecosystem services in disaster risk reduction and adaption to climatechange (see also Section 6.5.2.1).
The extent to which ecosystems support such benefits, though, depends
on a complex set of dynamic interactions among ecosystem-related
factors, as well as the intensity of the hazard (UNEP , 2006; Sudmeier-Rieux and Ash, 2009) and institutional and governance arrangements(see case studies in Angelsen et al., 2009). Scientific understanding of
the relationship between ecosystem structure and function and the
reduction of risks associated with weather and climate extremes is
limited, though growing.Investment in natural ecosystems also contributes significantly to
reduction in GHG emissions, through practices such as those associatedwith Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) and throughReduced Carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation(REDD) or REDD+, which additionally includes the value of conservationfrom sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forestcarbon stocks (UNEP , 2006; SCBD, 2009). Mangrove ecosystems, forexample, are important for carbon sequestration and storage,containing among the highest carbon pools: 1,060-2,020 t CO
2ha-1
or an annual carbon sequestration of 6.32 t CO2ha-1(Murray et al.,
2010), as well as providing the buffers against weather and climateextremes, biodiversity values, and livelihood benefits discussed above.Investment in natural ecosystems, through REDD and REDD+ relatedstrategies, can generate alternative sources of income for localcommunities and provide much needed financial incentives to preventdeforestation (Reid and Huq, 2005; Angelsen et al., 2009; SCBD, 2009;Sudmeier-Rieux and Ash, 2009; Murray et al., 2010), as well as provideadditional livelihood benefits from the conservation and restoration offorest ecosystems and the services they support (Longley and Maxwell,2003; MEA, 2005; SEEDS India, 2008; Sudmeier-Rieux and Ash, 2009;Murray et al., 2010).

solutions for climate change mitigation and/or adaptation to risksChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters

•In Vietnam, the Red Cross began planting mangroves in1994 with the result that, by 2002, some 12,000 hectares ofmangroves had cost US$1.1 million for planting but savedannual levee maintenance costs of US$ 7.3 million, shieldedinland areas from a significant typhoon in 2000, andrestored livelihoods in planting and harvesting shellfish(Reid and Huq, 2005; SCBD, 2009). 
•In the United States, wetlands are estimated to reduce
flooding associated with hurricanes at a value of US$ 8,250
per hectare per year, and US$ 23.2 billion a year in storm
protection services (Costanza et al., 2008). 
•In Orissa, India, a comparison of the impact of the 1999
super cyclone on 409 villages in two tahsils with andwithout mangroves showed that villages that had healthystands of mangroves suffered significantly less loss of livesthan those without (or limited areas) healthy mangroves,even though all villages had the benefit of early warningsand accounting for other social and economic variables(Das and Vincent, 2009). 371associated with weather and climatic extremes as an integral element
of national and sectoral development decisions (see Box 6-5).
Ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, often considered as part of ‘soft’
options, are a widely applicable approach to climate change adaptation
because they can be applied at regional, national, and local levels, at
both project and programmatic levels, and benefits can be realized overshort and long time scales. They can be a more cost-effective adaptationstrategy than hard infrastructure and engineering solutions, as alsodiscussed in Section 6.5.2.1, and produce multiple benefits, and are also
considerably more accessible to the rural poor than measures based on
hard infrastructure and engineering solutions (Sudmeier-Rieux and Ash,
2009). Communities are also able to integrate and maintain traditionaland local knowledge and cultural values in their risk reduction efforts
(SCBD, 2009). 
In the choice of ecosystem-based adaptation options, decisionmakers
may at times require making judgements about the tradeoffs between
particular climatic risk reduction services and other ecosystem services
also valued by humans. Such decisions benefit from information resultingfrom risk assessments, scenario planning, and adaptive management
approaches that recognize and incorporate these potential tradeoffs.This might be the case, for example when deciding to use wetlands forcoastal protection that requires emphasis on silt accumulation andstabilization possibly at the expense of wildlife values and recreation(SCBD, 2009), particularly when achieving a full complement ofbiodiversity values is highly complex and long-term in nature (UNEP ,2006).
However, countries would need to overcome many challenges if they are
to be successful in increasing investment in ecosystem-based solutions,including for example: 
•Insufficient recognition of the economic and social benefits ofecosystem services under current risk situations, let alone underpotential changes in climate extremes and disaster risks (Vignolaet al., 2009).
•Lack of interdisciplinary science and implementation capacity formaking informed decisions associated with complex and dynamicsystems (Leslie and McLeod, 2007; OECD, 2009). 
•Ability to estimate economic values of different ecosystem servicessupported by nature (TEEB, 2009).
•Lack of capacity to undertake careful cost and benefit assessmentsof alternative strategies to inform choices at the local level. Suchassessments could provide the total economic value of the full rangeof disaster-related ecosystem services, compared with alternativeuses of the forested land such as for agriculture (see, e.g., Balmfordet al., 2002). 
•Where they exist, data on and monitoring of ecosystem status andrisk are often dispersed across agencies at various scales and arenot always accessible at the sub-national or municipal level whereland use-planning decisions are made (UNISDR, 2009a). 
•The mismatch in geographic scales and mandates between theadministration and responsibilities for disaster reduction, and thatof ecosystem extent and functioning, such as in water basins(Leslie and McLeod, 2007; OECD, 2009).
6.5.3. Transferring and Sharing ‘Residual’ Risks
Not all risk can be reduced, and a residual, often sizeable risk willremain. Mechanisms for sharing and transferring residual risks forhouseholds and businesses have been introduced in Section 5.5.2.2 inthe context of managing local-level impacts and risks. Chapter 5 alsodiscusses the incentive and disincentive aspects provided by insurancefor risk management and adaptation to climate change at the local level.This section sets out the role of national-level institutions, especiallygovernments, in enabling and regulating practices at national scales. Italso discusses the need on the part of some governments to transfertheir own risks. 
Markets offer risk-sharing and transfer solutions, most prominently
property and asset insurance for households and businesses, and cropinsurance for farmers. Insurance markets are generally segregated andChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters

•Vietnam has applied strategic environmental assessments to
land use-planning projects and hydropower development forthe Vu Gia-Thu Bon River basin, including climatic disasterrisks (OECD, 2009; SCBD, 2009). 
•European countries affected by severe flooding, notably theUnited Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Germany, have madepolicy shifts to ‘make space for water’ by applying moreholistic river basin management plans and integratedcoastal zone management (DEFRA, 2005; Wood and VanHalsema, 2008; EC, 2009; ONERC 2009). 
•At the regional level, the Caribbean Development Bank hasintegrated weather and climatic disaster risks into itsenvironmental impact assessments for new developmentprojects (CDB and CARICOM, 2004; UNISDR, 2009c). 
•Under the Amazon Protected Areas Program, Brazil hascreated a more than 30 million hectare mosaic ofbiodiversity-rich forests reserve of state, provincial, private,and indigenous land, resulting in a potential reduction inemissions estimated at 1.8 billion tonnes of carbon throughavoided deforestation (World Bank, 2009). 
•Swiss Development Cooperation’s four-year project inMuminabad, Tajikistan adopted an integrated approach torisk through reforestation and integrated watershedmanagement (SDC, 2008). 372regulated nationally. Existing national insurance systems commonly
offer a wide variety of choice in providing protection for property andassets against natural hazards. National insurance systems differentiallyinclude hazards, such as storms, hail, floods, earthqua ke, and also
landslides or subsidence. Risks may be covered separately or bundledwith a fire policy or covered under an ‘all hazards’ policy. The contracts
differ in the extent of cover offered, as well as indemnity limits, andwhether the policies are compulsory, bundled, or voluntary. Importantly,they differ institutionally with regard to the involvement of the publicauthorities and private insurers and how they allocate liability andresponsibility for disaster losses across individual households, businesses,and taxpayers (Schwarze and Wagner, 2004; Aakre et al., 2010).
Yet, insurance coverage is limited and globally only about 20% of the
losses from weather-related events have been insured over the period1980 to 2003 (also see Section 6.2.2). In many instances, insuranceproviders even in industrialized countries have been reluctant to offerregion- or nationwide policies covering flood and other hazardsbecause of the systemic nature of these risks, as well as problems ofmoral hazard and adverse selection (Froot, 2001; Aakre et al., 2010). Insome highly exposed countries, such as The Netherlands for flood risk,insurance is even non-existent and government relief is dispensed inlieu (Botzen et al., 2009). In many developing countries, there is little interms of insurance for disaster risks, yet novel index-based micro-insurance solutions have been developed and are starting to showresults (Hazell and Hess, 2010; see also Sections 5.6.3 and Case Study9.2.13 on risk financing). Market mechanisms may work less well indeveloping countries, particularly because there is often limited riskassessment information, limited scope for risk pooling, and little or nosupply of insurance instruments. In such circumstances, governmentsmay need to create enabling environments by helping to estimate risk,helping to develop training programs for insurer’s staff, and generallypromoting awareness among the population at risk (Linnerooth-Bayeret al., 2005; Hoeppe and Guren ko, 2006; Cummins and Mahul, 2009;
Hazell and Hess, 2010).
Employing insurance and other risk-financing instruments for helping to
manage the vagaries of nature may often involve the building of PPPs
in developing and in developed countries in order to tackle market
failure, adverse selection, and the sheer non-availability of suchinstruments (see Aakre et al., 2010). Because of such reasons, there is a
role for governments to not only create an enabling environment for
private sector engagement, but also to regulate its activities. In the
development context, Hazell and Hess (2010) distinguish betweenprotection and promotion models, while acknowledging that in many
instances hybrid combinations may contain elements of both.
Protection relates to governments helping to protect themselves,individuals, and businesses from destitution and poverty by providingex-post financial assistance, which, however, is taken out as an ex-ante
instrument as insurance before disasters. The promotion model relates
to the public sector promoting more stable livelihoods and higherincome opportunities by better helping businesses and households
access risk financing, including micro-financing.Private insurers are often not willing to fully underwrite the risks and
many countries, including Japan, France, the United States, Norway, andNew Zealand, have therefore instituted public-private national insurancesystems, where participation of the insured is mandatory or voluntaryand single hazards may be insured or comprehensive insurance offered(Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007). Further, specific strategies maybe employed to increase market penetration of risks that are noteasily covered by regular avenues. As one example, in India, pro-poorregulation stipulates that insurers within their regular business segmentreserve a certain quota of insurance policies for the poor and thus cross-subsidize fledgling low-income micro-insurance policies (Mechler et al.,2006a).
As well, governments may insure their liabilities through sovereign
insurance. Liabilities arise as governments own a large portfolio of
public infrastructure and other assets that are exposed to disaster risks.
Moreover, most governments accept their role as provider of post-disaster emergency relief and assistance to vulnerable and affectedhouseholds and businesses. In wealthy countries, government (sovereign)insurance hardly exists at the national level and, in Sweden, insurancefor public assets is illegal (Linnerooth-Bayer and Amendola, 2000). Onthe other hand, states in the United States, Canada, and Australia,although regulated not to incur budget deficits, often carry cover fortheir public assets (Burby, 1991). As discussed earlier (see Section 6.4.3),this is consistent with the Arrow and Lind Theorem, which suggests thatgovernments can efficiently spread and share risk over their citizenswithout buying sovereign insurance policies. 
Yet, realizing the shortcomings of after-the-event approaches for coping
with disaster losses for small, low-income or highly exposed countrieswith over-stretched tax bases and highly correlated infrastructure risks(OAS, 1991; Pollner, 2000; Mechler, 2004; Cardona, 2006; Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007; Mahul and Ghesquiere, 2007), sovereigninsurance for public sector assets and relief expenditure has become arecent cornerstone for tackling the substantial and increasing effects ofdisasters (Mahul and Ghesquiere, 2007). As a general statement, thestrategy involves transferring a layer of risks ranging from infrequentrisk (such as events with a return period of more than 10 years) up to risksassociated with 150-year return periods, beyond which it will becomevery costly to insure (Cummins and Mahul, 2009). One key element is todefine the financial vulnerability indicating the inability to bear losseswith a certain return period (Mechler et al., 2010). 
Key applications have been implemented in Mexico in 2006, which
insured its government emergency relief expenditure, and in the
Caribbean with the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility in
2007 (Ghesquiere, et al., 2006; Cardenas et al., 2007). Like national
governments, donor organizations, exposed indirectly through their
relief and assistance programs, also have been considering similar
transactions; the World Food Programme in 2006, for example, purchased
‘humanitarian insurance’ for its drought exposure in Ethiopia through
index-based reinsurance (see Section 9.2.13). These transactions set
innovative and promising precedents in terms of protecting highly
Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters373exposed developing and transition government portfolios against the
risks imposed by disasters. 
6.5.4. Managing the Impacts
Even in the rare circumstances where efforts outlined previously are allin place, there still needs to be investment in capacities to managepotential disaster impacts as risk cannot be reduced to zero (Pelling,2003; Wisner et al., 2004; Coppola, 2007). The scale of the disaster
impact should ideally dictate the level and extent of response. Individual
household capacities to respond to disasters may be quickly overwhelmed,requiring local resources to be mobilized (del Ninno, 2001). Whencommunity-level responses are overwhelmed, regional or centralgovernments are called upon (Coppola, 2007). Some events mayoverwhelm national government capacities too, and may requiremobilization of the international community of humanitarian responders(Fagen, 2008; Harvey, 2009). International responses pose the mostcomplex management challenges for national governments, because ofthe diversity of actors that are involved and the multiple resources flowsthat are established (Borton, 1993; Bennett et al., 2006; Ramalingam etal., 2008; ALNAP , 2010a). However, although humanitarian principlescall for a proportionate and equitable response, in practice there are a fewhigh-profile disasters that are over-resourced, with many more that are‘forgotten or neglected emergencies’ (Slim, 2006). Despite the definition ofinternational or national disasters as those where immediate capacitiesare overwhelmed, evaluations routinely find that most of the vital life-saving activities happen at the local level, led by households, communities,and civil society (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2; Smillie, 2001; Hilhorst, 2003;ALNAP , 2005; Telford and Cosgrave, 2006).
In terms of how responses are managed nationally, there are different
models to consider (ALNAP , 2010b). Many countries now have somestanding capacity to manage disaster events (Interworks, 1998) and thisshould be considered distinct from national systems for managingdisaster risk, commonly associated with ‘national platforms’ detailed inSection 6.4.2. Examples of standing disaster management capacityinclude the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United
States, Public Safety in Canada, the National Commission for DisasterReduction in China, the National Disaster Management Authorities in
India and Indonesia, National Disaster Management Offices (NDMO) in
many Pacific island countries, and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in
the United Kingdom. Comparative analysis of these structures shows
that there are a number of common elements (Interworks, 1998;
Coppola, 2007). Countries with formal disaster management structurestypically operate a system comprised of a National Disaster Committee,
which works to provide high-level authority and ministerial coordination,alongside an NDMO to lead the practical implementation of disaster
preparedness and response (Interworks, 1998). National Committeesare typically composed of representatives from different ministries anddepartments as well as the Red Cross/Red Crescent. They might alsoinclude donor agencies, NGOs, and the private sector. The committee
works to coordinate the inputs of different institutions to provide acomprehensive approach to disaster management. NDMOs usually act
as the executive arm of the national committee. Focal points for disastermanagement are usually professional disaster managers. NDMOs maybe operational, or in large countries they may provide policy andstrategic oversight to decentralized operational entities at federal orlocal levels. Where formal structures do not exist, national ministerialoversight is provided to the efforts of the NDMO in times of nationaldisasters.
Government ownership of the national disaster management function
can vary, with three models evident: it may reside with the presidentialor prime ministerial offices; it may sit within a specific ministry; or it maybe distributed across ministries (Interworks, 1998). The way in which theinternational community is engaged in major emergencies is shaped byexisting national capabilities and social contracts, with four possibleresponse approaches (Chandran and Jones 2008; ALNAP , 2010b; seeTable 6-4). Analysis based on these broad categories helps clarify theways in which international agencies are mobilized to manage disasterimpacts, following from national structure and capabilities.
There may be states where there is an existing or emerging social
contract with its citizens, by which the state undertakes to assist andprotect them in the face of disasters, and there is a limited role forinternational agencies, focusing on advocacy and fundraising. Bycomparison, there are states that have a growing capacity to respondand request international agencies to supplement their effort in specificlocally owned ways, through filling gaps in national capacities orresources. Next, there are states that have limited capacity and resourcesto meet their responsibilities to assist and protect their citizens in theface of disasters, and which request international assistance to copewith the magnitude of a disaster, resulting in a fully fledged internationalresponse. Finally, there are states that lack the will to negotiate aresilient social contract, including assisting and protecting their citizens

combination of direct delivery and advocacy. Across all four categories
of response, there are challenges around resources availability,proportionality of distribution, coordination, and leadership (ALNAP ,2010a). 
Box 6-6 outlines details of the disaster management systems of two
countries, which were chosen to illustrate the different stages of
disaster management development that are evident across states.
Although level of response and actors involved can vary considerably
between disasters and countries (ALNAP , 2010a), the basic actions
taken to manage disaster impacts remain broadly the same across
countries, and correspond closely to the different stages of the disaster
timeline (see Table 6-4; Coppola, 2007). In general, disaster management
employs immediate humanitarian activities, needs assessments, and thedelivery of goods and services to meet requirements. The demand for
water, food, shelter, sanitation, healthcare, security, and – later on –education, employment, reconstruction, and so on is balanced againstavailable resources (Wisner and Adams, 2002).
Despite the existence of evidence that climate change is not responsible
for the vast majority of the increasing trend in disaster losses (see SPMand Section 4.5.3.3), climate change-related disasters are still widely, ifincorrectly, seen by particularly the humanitarian community as playinga major role in increasing the overall human impact of disasters.Numerous trends in disaster events are commonly attributed to climatechange (IASC, 2009a; IFRC, 2009), and, as such, climate change is oftencited as a reason for enhancing both national and international disastermanagement capacities (HFP , 2007; Oxfam, 2007; IASC, 2009a,b).Consequently, climate change-related considerations are increasinglyfeaturing in literature on disaster management (Barrett et al., 2007;Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
Box 6-6 | National Disaster Preparedness, Prevention, and Management Systems: China and Kenya
China
The Government’s disaster management process, developed as National Integrated Disaster Reduction, is a comprehensive system br inging
together a number of central and local government sectors and covering the different phases of disasters preparedness, response , and
recovery/rehabilitation. China has put in place over 30 laws and regulations regarding disaster management. The Emergency Respo nse
Law was adopted on 30 August 2007, as the central legal document governing all disaster-related efforts in China.
Under the related law and regulations, the Government has established an emergency response system consisting of three levels:
• The National Master Plan for Responding to Public Emergencies – a framework to be used throughout government to ensure public
security and cope with public emergency events, including all disaster response activities.
• Five national thematic disaster response plans that outline the detailed assignment of duties and arrangements for major disas ter
response categories – disaster relief, flood and drought, earthquakes, geological disasters, and very severe forest fires.
• Emergency response plans for 15 central government departments and their detailed implementation plans and operation norms
(UNESCAP , 2009).
KenyaThe government is working toward a national disaster management policy with the intention of preventing disasters and minimizin g the
disruption they cause through taking steps to reduce risks. The policy will help enhance existing capacities by building resili ence to hazard
events, building institutional capacity, developing a well-managed disaster response system, reducing vulnerability, and ensuri ng that
disaster policy is integrated with development policy and poverty reduction and takes a multi-sectoral, multi-level approach. T he Ministry
of State for Special Programmes will be responsible for the coordination of the disaster management policy, will promote integr ation
and coordination of disaster management, and will establish a national institute for disaster research to improve systematic mo nitoring
and promotion of research. 
The draft policy published in 2009 stressed the central role of climate change in any future sustainable planned and integrated  National
Strategy for Disaster Management. It sets out principles for effective disaster management, codes of conduct of different stake holders, and
provides for the establishment of an institutional framework that is legally recognized and embedded within the government stru ctures.
It stresses the importance of mobilizing resources to enable the implementation of the policy, with provision of 2% of the annu al public
budget to a National Disaster Management Fund. 
At the time of writing, this policy has not reached Parliament for discussion and approval (MOSSP , 2010).375McGray et al., 2007; Mitchell and Van Aalst, 2008; Venton and La Trobe,
2008; IASC, 2009a). As presented in this report, evidence is available forthe influence of climate change on some extreme weather events butnot for others (see Chapter 3), and, perhaps because of this, challengesremain in how climate change-related information can be used as adirect guide to decisionmaking in the humanitarian sector (IASC, 2009a). 
The challenges of climate change call for institutional changes in
approaches to managing disasters that are far from trivial (Salter 1998),with such challenges including more appropriate policies and legislation;decentralization of capacities and resources; greater budgetary allocation;improved capacity building at the local level; and the political will tobridge the divide between disaster risk reduction activities and thehumanitarian action associated with managing disasters (Sanderson,2000; UNISDR, 2005). Recent analyses of the need for greater innovationin international humanitarian responses (Ramalingam et al., 2009)present these shifts as among the most significant and importantreforms the international system must undergo. 
6.6. Aligning National Disaster Risk
Management Systems with theChallenges of Climate Change
As mentioned, climate change presents multidimensional challenges for
national systems for managing the risks of climate extremes and disasterrisks, including potential changes in the way society views, treats, andresponds to risks and projected impacts on hazards, exposure, andvulnerability. As climate change is altering the frequency and magnitudeof some extreme events (see Chapter 3) and contributing to trends inexposure and vulnerability (see Chapter 4), the efficacy of national sys tems
of disaster risk management requires review and realignment with thenew challenges (UNISDR, 2009c; Mitchell et al., 2010a; Polack, 2010; seeFAQ 6.1). Literature suggests that the effectiveness of national systemsfor managing disaster risk in a changing climate will be improved if theyintegrate assessments of changing climate extremes and disasters intocurrent investments, strategies, and activities; seek to strengthen theadaptive capacity of all actors; and address the causes of vulnerabilityand poverty recognizing climate change as one such cause (Schipper,
2009; UNISDR 2009c; Mitchell et al., 2010a). In practice, this mightrequire: (i) new alliances and hybrid organizations across government
and potentially across countries; (ii) different actors to join the national
system; (iii) new cross-sector relationships; (iv) reallocation of functions,
responsibilities, and resources across scales; and (v) new practices (Hedgeret al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2010a; Polack, 2010). As a complement to theavailable data, information, and knowledge about the impact of climate
change and disaster risk presented in Chapters 2, 3, and 4, this section
seeks to elaborate the key areas where realignment of national systems
could occur – in assessing the effectiveness of disaster risk management
in a changing climate (Section 6.6.1), managing uncer tainty and adaptive
management (Section 6.6.2), in tackling poverty, vulnerability, and their
structural causes (Section 6.6.3); and comment ing on the practicalities of
approaching such changes holistically (Section 6.6.4).6.6.1. Assessing the Effectiveness of Disaster Risk
Management in a Changing Climate
In order to align disaster risk management with the challenges presented
by climate change, it is necessary to assess the effectiveness andefficiency of management options in a changing climate based on thebest available information, recognizing that that information remains
patchy at best. Adopting an economic assessment framework, different
approaches have been used to comment on the effectiveness or effi ciency
of adaptation options. Many climate adaptation studies have focused onthe national-level costs of adaptation rather than comparing costs andbenefits (i.e., examining the benefits of adaptation or reduced disasterimpacts and damage costs) (see Nordhaus, 2006; EEA, 2007; UNFCCC,2007a; Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008; World Bank, 2008; ECA, 2009;Parry et al., 2009). National-level adaptation assessments have beenconducted, among others, in the European Union, the United Kingdom,Finland, The Netherlands, and Canada, as well as in a number ofdeveloping countries using the NAPA approach (UNDP , 2004c; MMM, 2005;DEFRA, 2006; UNFCCC, 2007b; Lemmen et al., 2008; De Bruinet al., 2009a). 
Other approaches include assessments of disaster risk management
with risk assessment at the core, and focusing on economic efficiency ofmanagement responses (see World Bank, 1996; Benson and Twigg, 2004;Mechler, 2004). Using such a rationale, the World Bank, for example,goes as far as suggesting that governments should in many instancesprioritize allocating their resources on early warning (such as forfloods), critical infrastructure, such as water and electricity lifelines, andsupporting environmental buffers such as mangroves, forests, andwetlands, of which the latter should be treated with caution (WorldBank and UN, 2010). Another report suggests taking an adaptation costcurve approach to selecting adaptation options (ECA, 2009); thisapproach organizes adaptation options around their cost-benefit ratios,similar to mitigation cost curves. Interestingly, many of the optionsconsidered efficient in this analysis are ‘soft’ options, such as revivingreefs, using mangroves as barriers, and nourishing beaches.
It is, however, difficult to make conclusive assessments about the
effectiveness of disaster risk management in a changing climate, asoverall the evidence base used to determine economic efficiency – thatis, benefits net of costs of adaptation – remains limited and fragmented(Adger et al., 2007; UNFCCC, 2007a; Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008).In addition to the rather small number of studies available, there areimportant limitations of these assessments as well. These relate to thetypes of hazards examined as well as treatment of extreme events andrisk, affecting the robustness of the results. Another key limitation, relevantfor this report, is that only very few national level studies assessingeconomic efficiency of options have focused explicitly on disaster risk,and in most instances the hazards examined have been gradual, such assea level rise and slower onset impacts, such as drought, on agriculture(see UNFCCC, 2007a; Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008). Where extremeevents and disaster risks have been considered, studies have oftenadopted deterministic impact metrics, when disaster risk associatedwith frequency and variability of extreme events can change. WhereChapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disastersdisaster risks have been accounted for, the robustness of future projec tions
of risk is also uncertain (Bouwer, 2010).
Furthermore, many of the economic cost assessments faced key
methodological challenges, including the difficulty in estimating economic
values of intangible effects of disasters, such as impact on human life,
suffering, and ecological services, different rates of time preferences or
discounting the future, as well as the difficulties associated with prop erlyaccounting for the distribution of costs and benefits across different
sectors of society (Parry et al., 2009). Such challenges suggest that thevalue of tools, such as cost-benefit analysis, for the assessment ofeconomic efficiency, even with risk considerations, may lie in theusefulness of the analytical process rather than the numeric outcomesper se. They suggest that in the context of climate adaptation, suchtools may be most usefully employed as a heuristic tool in the contextof iterative stakeholder decisionmaking processes (Moench et al., 2007).

FAQ 6.1 | What can a government do to better prepare its people for changing
climate-related disaster risks?
In almost all countries, governments create the enabling environment of policies, regulations, institutional arrangements, and coordination
mechanisms to guide and support the efforts of all agencies and stakeholders involved in managing disaster risks at different s cales.
Such risks are increasing and changing because of population growth, migration, climate change, and a range of other factors. N ational
systems for managing disaster risk need to act on these changes in order to build resilience in the short and long term. Accord ingly, the
following measures can be considered: 
•Generate and communicate robust information about the dynamic nature of disaster risk : Given the dynamic and changing
nature of disaster risks in the context of climate change, regular updates on changes in the level of risk will further strengt hen such
systems if the information is acted upon. Not possessing information about changing disaster risks or not integrating the infor mation
into decisions about longer-term investments can lead to increases in the exposure and vulnerability of people and assets and m ay
increase risk over time. An example could be non-drought-tolerant monoculture agriculture in an area likely to experience incre ased
frequency and/or longer durations of drought conditions, or water harvesting tanks installed in houses or communities that lack  the
capacity to supply water during longer periods of drought, or roads not raised sufficiently above future projected flood levels .
Knowledge about dynamic risks can be generated from scientific observations and models, combined with analysis of patterns ofvulnerability and exposure and from the experiences of local communities (see Section 6.5.1). 
•Even without robust information, consider ‘no or
low regrets’ strategies, including ecosystem-basedadaptation : Countries have started to adopt ‘no or low
regrets’ strategies that generate short-term benefits aswell as help to prepare for projected changes in disasterrisks, even when robust information is not available (seeSection 6.3.1). Included in these ‘no or low regrets’strategies are ecosystem-based strategies that not onlyhelp reduce current vulnerabilities and exposure tohazards under a range of climatic conditions, but alsoproduce other co-benefits such as improved livelihoodsand poverty reduction that help reduce vulnerability toprojected changes in climate. Table 6-5, a considerablyreduced version of Table 6-1, shows a summary of theseoptions. Such ‘no or low regrets’ practices also tend toinclude measures to tackle the underlying drivers ofdisaster risk and are effective irrespective of projectedchanges in extremes of weather or climate (see Section6.5.2). Where better information is available, this can bemainstreamed across line ministries and other agencies
to shape practices that help to build resilience toprojected changes in disaster risk over the longer term.These are highlighted in the right-hand column of
Table 6-5.Table 6-5 | Range of practices to demonstrate comparison between ‘no or low regrets’
measures and those integrating projected changes in disaster risk.

•Use risk-sharing and transfer mechanisms to protect financial security : To effectively support communities and protect the
financial security of the country, governments are increasingly using a range of financial instruments for transferring costs o f disaster
losses through risk-sharing mechanisms. Key risk transfer instruments include financial insurance, micro-insurance, and micro-financing, investment in social capital, government disaster reserve funds, and intergovernmental risk sharing. The latter two help
to provide much needed relief and immediate liquidity after a disaster in regions where individual countries, because of their size
and lack of diversity, cannot have viable risk insurance schemes. Such mechanisms can allow for more effective governmentresponse, provide some relief of the fiscal burden placed on governments due to disaster impacts, and constitute critical steps  in
promoting more proactive risk management strategies and responses (see Section 6.5.3). 
•Not all disaster risk can be eliminated, so act to manage residual risk too : Even with effective disaster risk reduction policies
and practices in place, it is impossible to reduce all disaster risks to zero and some residual risks will remain. With disaste r risks
increasing in many countries, steps could be taken to strengthen governments’ ability to effectively manage residual risks effe ctively,
and in doing so will need to strengthen partnerships with other actors and stakeholders to enable quick and effective humanitar ian
response that includes measures to ‘build back better’ and build resilience over time (for example, using rapid climate risk as sessments
to position critical infrastructure or relief camps in safer locations during relief and reconstruction phases). Many governmen ts are
also already working to enhance their disaster preparedness and early warning systems, focusing on the accuracy and timeliness of
warnings, increasing public awareness, working with communities to ensure messages are communicated and transmitted effectively ,
and enhancing preparedness measures, such as first aid training, providing swimming lessons, encouraging households to have adisaster plan and an emergency kit, securing and indicating evacuation routes and shelters, and enhancing the skills of relief workers
in child protection, for example (see Section 6.5.4).
•Review resilience-building efforts : Given competing priorities and development goals, governments are forced to balance
resource allocation across development goals. The decision to bear residual losses is always a risk management option due tofinancial and other constraints. Many governments decide to accept the full risk of very low probability and surprise events, b ut
new information on the impacts of climate change on such events may lead to such decisions being reviewed. Even in such caseswhere risk reduction and risk transfer is not a viable management option, investments in reducing vulnerability and enhancing e arly
warning, preparedness, and standing capacity for emergency response can lead to positive returns. Furthermore, given uncertaint ies
associated with disasters, efforts to promote flexible institutions, cross-scale learning, improved knowledge and awareness, an d
redundancies in response systems (in case one part of the system is badly impacted) can all help to promote resilience to very low
probability and surprise events. Many governments are also encouraging maintenance and strengthening of social cohesivenessand social networks as a form of insurance enabling families and friends to support each other in times of disasters (see Secti ons
6.6.2 and 6.6.3).
A limited number of studies have used other tools such as multi-criteria
analysis and other variants, which do not rely on just quantitative values,to help in the stakeholder-based adaptation decisionmaking (De Bruinet al., 2009a; Debels et al., 2009; Cardona et al., 2010). Debels et al.(2009) developed a multi-purpose index for a quick evaluation of
adaptation practices in terms of proper design, implementation, andpost-implementation evaluation and applied it to cases in Latin
America. Mechler et al. (2006b) developed a metric for measuring fiscalvulnerability to natural hazards, capturing the relationship between theeconomic and fiscal losses that a country could experience when a
catastrophic event occurs and the availability of funds to address thesituation. Cardona et al. (2010), building on this, constructed the DisasterDeficit Index and applied it across a range of Latin American countriesto support governmental decisionmaking in disaster risk managementover time. De Bruin et al. (2009b) describe a hybrid approach based on
qualitative and quantitative assessments of adaptation options forflood risk in The Netherlands. For the qualitative part, stakeholders
selected options in terms of their perceived importance, urgency, and
other elements. In the quantitative assessment, costs and benefits of
key adaptation options are determined. Finally, using priority rankingbased on a weighted sum of the qualitative and quantitative criteria
suggests that in The Netherlands, for example, an integrated portfolio ofnature and water management with risk-based policies has particularlyhigh potential and acceptance for stakeholders. Overall, the assessmentof adaptation explicitly considering the risk-based nature of extremeevents remains fragmented and incipient, and more work will be neces sary
to improve the robustness of results and confidence in assessments.
6.6.2. Managing Uncertainties and
Adaptive Management in National Systems 
Disasters associated with climate extremes are inherently complex,
involving socioeconomic as well as environmental and meteorologicaluncertainty (Hallegatte et al., 2007; see Chapter 3). Population, social,economic, and environmental change all influence the way in whichhazards are experienced, through their impact on levels of exposure andon people’s sensitivity to hazards (Pielke Jr. et al., 2003; Aldunce et al.,2008). Uncertainty about the magnitude, frequency, and severity ofclimate extremes is managed, to an extent, through the development ofpredictive models and early warning systems (see Section 3.2.3 and
Box 3-2; Section 9.2.11). Early warning systems are also based onmodels and consequently there is always a probability of their success (orfailure) in predicting events accurately, although the failure to heed earlywarning systems is also a function of social factors, such as perceptionof risk, trust in the information-providing institution, previous experienceof the hazard, degree of social exclusion, and gender (see, e.g., Drabek,1986, 1999). Enhanced scientific modeling and interdisciplinaryapproaches to early warning systems can address some of theseuncertainties provided good baseline and time series information areavailable (see Section 3.2.3 and Box 3-2). Even where such informationis available, there remain other unresolved questions that influence theoutcome of hazards. These relate to the capacity of ecosystems to pro vide
buffering services, and the ability of systems to recover. Managementapproaches that take these issues into account include adaptivemanagement and resilience, yet these approaches are not without theirchallenges (also see Section 8.6.3.1).
Adaptive management, as defined in Chapter 8 (Section 8.6.3.1), is “a
structured process for improving management policies and practices bysystemic learning from the outcomes of implemented strategies, and bytaking into account changes in external factors in a proactive manner”
(Pahl-Wostl et al., 2009; Pahl-Wostl, 2009). It has come to also meanbringing together interdisciplinary science, experience, and traditional
knowledge into decisionmaking through ‘learning by doing’ by individualsand organizations (Walters, 1997). Decisionmakers, under adaptivemanagement, are expected to be flexible in their approach, and acceptnew information as it become available, or when new challenges emerge,
and not be rigid in their responses. Proponents argue that effective
adaptive management contributes to more rapid knowledge acquisition
and better information flows between policymakers, and ensures that
there is shared understanding of complex problems (Lee, 1993). 
In most cases, adaptive management has been implemented at the local
or regional scale and there are few examples of its implementation at
the national level. Examples of adaptive management abound in
ecosystem management (Johnson, 1999; Ladson and Argent, 2000) andin disaster risk management (Thompson and Gaviria, 2004; Tompkins,
2005; see Box 6-7). Nearly 40 years of research, after the seminal paperwas published by Holling in 1973, have produced evidence of the impactsof aspects of resilience policy (notably adaptive management) on forests,coral reefs, disasters, and adaptation to climate change; however, mostof this has been at the local or ecosystem scale. 
One of the main unresolved issues in adaptive management is how to
ensure that scientists and engineers tasked with investigating adaptationand disaster risk management processes are able to learn from eachother and from practitioners and how this learning can be integrated toinform policy and management practices. In the case of the restorationof the Florida Everglades, a limiting factor to effective managementobserved was the unwillingness of some parts of society to accept short-term losses for longer-term sustainability of ecosystem services (Kiker etal., 2001). Investment in hurricane preparedness in New Orleans prior to
Hurricane Katrina provides a contemporary example of science not beingincluded in disaster risk decisionmaking and planning (Laska, 2004;Congleton, 2006). The Cayman Islands hurricane management, on theother hand, demonstrates a success story in a flexible disaster manage ment
committee being prepared to change its strategies and measures fromexperience, and essentially learning by doing (Box 6-7).
Spare capacity within institutions has been argued to increase the ability
of socio-ecological systems to address surprises or external shocks (Folkeet al., 2005). McDaniels et al. (2008), in their analysis of hospital resilienceto earthquake impacts, agreed with this finding, concluding that keyfeatures of resilience include the ability to learn from previous experi ence,
careful management of staff during hazard, daily communication, andwillingness of staff to address specific system failures. The latter can beachieved through creating overlapping institutions with shared deliveryof services/functions, and providing redundant capacity within theseinstitutions thereby allowing a sharing of the risks (Low et al., 2003).Such redundancy increases the chances of social memory being retainedwithin the institution (Ostrom, 2005). However, if not carefully managed,costs of this approach can include fragmented policy, high transactionscosts, duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies (Imperial, 1999).
378Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
Box 6-7 | Building Resilience to Disasters in the Cayman Islands
Key aspects that are relevant to building disaster resilience are flexibility, learning, and adaptive governance (Adger et al.,  2005; Berkes,
2007), and the Cayman Islands (Tompkins et al., 2008) illustrate how such factors help to successfully manage their disaster ri sks. For
example, in 2004, Hurricane Ivan (which was similar in magnitude to Hurricane Katrina that hit New Orleans in 2005) only caused  two
fatalities in the island, largely due to the activities of the National Hurricane Committee (NHC), which manages hurricane disa ster risk
reduction in the Cayman Islands and is responsible for preparedness, response, and recovery. The NHC is a learning-based organi zation.
It learns from its successes, but more importantly from mistakes made. Each year the disaster managers actively assess the prev ious
year’s risk management successes and failures. Every year the National Hurricane Plan is revised to incorporate this learning a nd to
ensure that good practices are institutionalized. Evidence of adaptive governance can be observed, for example, in the changingcomposition of the NHC, its structure, network arrangements, funding allocation, and responsibilities. Policymakers are encoura ged to
design and to implement new initiatives, to make adjustments, and take motivated actions. Creating such space for experimentati on,
innovation, learning, and institutional adjustment is crucial for disaster resilience.379Chapter 6 National Systems for Managing the Risks from Climate Extremes and Disasters
‘Learning by doing’ in disaster risk management can only be undertaken
effectively if the management institutions are scaled appropriately,where necessary at the local level, or at multiple scales with effectiveinteraction (Gunderson and Holling, 2002; Eriksen et al., 2011). For themanagement of climate extremes, the appropriate scale is influenced bythe magnitude of the hazard and the affected area, including biologicaldiversity. Research suggests that increasing biological diversity ofecosystems allows a greater range of ecosystem responses to hazards,and this increases the resilience of the entire system (Elmqvist et al.,2003). Other research has shown that reducing non-climate stresses onecosystems can enhance their resilience to climate change. This is thecase for coral reefs (Hughes et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2008)and rainforests (Malhi et al., 2008). Managing the resources at theappropriate scale, for example, water catchment or coastal zone insteadof managing smaller individual tributaries or coastal sub-systems (suchas mangroves), is becoming more urgent (Sorensen, 1997; Parkes andHorwitz, 2009).
Climate resilience as a development objective is, however, difficult to
implement, particularly as it is unclear as to what resilience means(Folke, 2006). Unless resilience is clearly defined and broadly understood,
with measurable indicators designed to fit different local contexts andto show the success, the potential losers from this policy may gounnoticed, causing problems with policy implementation and legitimacy(Eakin et al., 2009). See the Glossary for this report’s definition ofresilience, and more details regarding uncertainty and resilience relatedto extreme events in the light of climate change are given in Section3.2.3, Box 3-2, and Section 8.5.1.
6.6.3. Tackling the Underlying Drivers of Vulnerability 
This assessment has found that future trends in exposure, vulnerability,and climate extremes may further alter disaster risk and associated impacts.Future trends in climate extremes will be affected by anthropogenicclimate change in addition to natural climate variability, and exposure andvulnerability will be influenced by both climatic and non-climatic factors(SPM; Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5). Accordingly, reducing vulnerability andits underlying drivers is a considered a critical aspect of addressing both
observed and projected changes in disaster risk (UNISDR 2009c, 2011b;Figure 6-3). Section 6.5.2.2 discussed the centrality of human developmentand vulnerability reduction to the goal of disaster risk reduction. As
an extension, literature focused on aligning national disaster risk
management systems to the challenges posed by climate change andother dynamic drivers of disaster risk places considerable importance onaddressing the underlying drivers of vulnerability as one of the most
effective ‘low or no regrets’ measures (see Figure 6-3 and Table 6-5 in
FAQ 6.1; Tanner and Mitchell, 2008; Davies et al., 2008; CCCD, 2009;UNISDR, 2009c; Mitchell et al., 2010a). Such underlying drivers ofvulnerability include inequitable development; poverty; declining
ecosystems; lack of access to power, basic services, and land; and weakgovernance (Wisner et al., 2004; Schipper 2009; UNISDR 2009c, 2011b).An approach to managing disaster risk in the context of a changingclimate highlights that disaster risk management efforts should seek to
develop partnerships to tackle vulnerability drivers by focusing onapproaches that promote more socially just and economic systems;forge partnerships to ensure the rights and entitlements of people toaccess basic services, productive assets, and common propertyresources; empower communities and local authorities to influence thedecisions of national governments, NGOs, and international and privatesector organizations and to promote accountability and transparency;and promote environmentally sensitive development (Hedger et al.,2010; Mitchell et al., 2010a; Polack, 2010).
To date, strategies for tackling the risks of climate extremes and
disasters, in practice, have tended to focus on treating the symptoms ofvulnerability, and with it risk, rather than the underlying causes, partlydue to disaster risk management still not being a core component ofsustainable development (Schipper, 2009). The mid-term review of the HFAindicates that insufficient effort is being made to tackle the conditions that
create risk (UNISDR, 2011b), and other studies have found a continueddisconnect between disaster risk management and developmentprocesses that tackle the structural causes of poverty and vulnerabilityand between knowledge and implementation at all scales (CCCD, 2009;UNISDR, 2009c). The impacts of climate change, both on disaster riskand on vulnerability and poverty, are viewed by some as a potentialforce that will help to forge a stronger connection between disaster riskreduction measures and poverty and vulnerability reduction measures,also partly as a result of increased availability of financial resources andrenewed political will (Soussan and Burton, 2002; Schipper, 2009;Mitchell et al., 2010a). A recent and growing body of literature hasfocused on the potential for strengthening the links among particularforms of social protection, disaster risk reduction, and climate changeadaptation measures as a way to simultaneously tackle the drivers ofvulnerability, poverty, and hence disaster risk (see Section 8.3.1; Davieset al., 2008; Heltberg et al., 2009). With increasing levels of exposure todisaster risk in middle-income countries (see Section 6.1; UNISDR,2009c, 2011a), reducing vulnerability of poor people and their assets insuch locations is becoming a focus for those governments and for CSOsand CBOs (Tanner and Mitchell, 2008). 
6.6.4. Approaching Disaster Risk, Adaptation,
and Development Holistically
As this chapter has demonstrated, climate change poses diverse and
complex challenges for actors in national disaster risk managementsystems and for disaster risk management policies and practices morebroadly. These challenges include changes in the magnitude andfrequency of some hazards in some regions, impacts on vulnerabilityand exposure, new agreements and resource flows, and the potential ofclimate change to alter value systems and people’s perceptions. As TableSPM.1 highlights, it is the complexity resulting from the combination ofthese factors, in addition to the uncertainty generated, that meansnational disaster risk management systems and broader nationalstrategies may need to be realigned to maintain and improve theireffectiveness. There is high agreement but limited evidence to suggest
that a business-as-usual approach to disaster risk management thatfails to take the impacts of climate change into account will becomeincreasingly ineffective. Section 6.6 and other parts of this chapterhave assessed evidence on the different elements involved in such arealignment. A selection of these elements is briefly summarized here. 
As discussed in Section 6.6.2, there is high agreement but limited
evidence to suggest that flexible and adaptive national systems for
disaster risk management, based on the principle of learning by doing,are better suited to managing the challenges posed by changes inexposure, vulnerability, and weather and climate extremes than staticand rigid systems (see Section 8.6). This ability to be flexible will betested by a systems’ capacity to act on new knowledge generated bythe frequent assessment of dynamic risk needed to capture trends inexposure vulnerability and weather and climate extremes and byinformation on how the costs and benefits of different response meas ures
change as a result (Section 6.6.1). The accuracy of these assessmentswill be based on the quality of available data (Section 6.5.2.1). Wheresuch assessments generate uncertainty for decisionmakers, tools suchas multi-criteria analysis, scenario planning, and flexible decision pathsoffer ways of supporting informed action (Section 6.6.1).
There is high agreement and robust evidence to demonstrate that the
mainstreaming of disaster risk management processes into developmentplanning and practice leads to more resilient development pathways. Byextension, with climate change and other development processes havingan impact on disaster risk, these changes then need to be factored intodevelopment and economic planning decisions at different scales. Thissuggests an ideal national system for managing the risks from climateextremes and disasters would be designed to be fully integrated witheconomic and social development, environmental, poverty reduction,and humanitarian dimensions to create a holistic approach. The natureof transformational changes in thinking, analysis, planning, approaches,strategies, and actions is the subject of Chapter 8 (particularly Section8.2.2).
While there is limited evidence that some countries have begun to factor
climate change into the way disaster risks are assessed and managed(see Sections 6.3 and 6.6.1), few countries appear to have adopted acomprehensive approach – for example, by addressing projected changesin exposure, vulnerability, and extremes as well as adopting a learning-
by-doing approach to decisionmaking embedded in the context of
national development planning processes. Incremental efforts toward
implementing suitable strategies for mainstreaming climate change
responses into national development planning and budgetary processes,and climate proofing at the sector and project levels (Sections 6.2 and6.3) in the context of disaster risk management appear to be the most
likely approach adopted by many countries. None of these measures willbe easy to implement, as actors and stakeholders at all levels of societyare being asked to embrace a dynamic notion of risk as an inherent partof their decisions, and continuously learn and modify policies, decisions,and actions taking into account new traditional and scientific knowledgeas it emerges. 
The knowledge base for understanding changing climate-related disaster
risks and for the way national systems are acting on this understandingthrough modifying practices, altering the nature of relationshipsbetween different actors, and adopting new strategies and policies isfragmented and incomplete. As this chapter has illustrated, incompleteinformation and knowledge gaps do not need to present blockages to
action. As FAQ 6.1 and Section 6.3.1 highlight, there is considerableexperience of governments and other actors investing in measures to
respond to existing climate variability and disaster risk that can beconsidered as ‘no or low regrets’ options when taking into account theuncertainty associated with future climate. However, in conducting thisassessment, some knowledge gaps have emerged that, if filled, wouldaid the creation of enduring national risk management systems fortackling observed and projected disaster risk. These gaps include the
need for more research on: 
•The extent to which efforts to build disaster risk managementcapacities at different scales prepare people and organizations forthe challenges posed by climate change. 
•Whether the current trend of decentralizing disaster risk managementfunctions to sub-national and local governments and communitiesis effective, given the level of information and capacity requirements,changing risks, and associated uncertainties presented by climatechange. 
•How the function, roles, and responsibilities of different actorsworking within national disaster risk management systems arechanging, given the impacts of climate change at the national andsub-national level.
•The characteristics of flexibility, learning-by-doing, and adaptivemanagement in the context of national disaster risk managementsystems in different governance contexts. 
•How decisions on disaster risk management interventions are madeat different scales if there is limited context-specific information. 
•The costs and benefits of different risk management interventionsif the impacts of climate change and other dynamic drivers of riskare factored in. 
•The benefits and tradeoffs of creating integrated programs andpolicies that seek to manage disaster risk, mitigate GHGs, adapt toclimate change, and reduce poverty simultaneously.

Increasing global interconnectivity, population, and economic growth, and the mutual interdependence of
economic and ecological systems, can serve both to reduce vulnerability and to amplify disaster risks ( high
confidence ). Global development pathways are becoming a more important factor in the management of
vulnerability and disaster risk. [7.2.1]
The international community has accumulated substantial experience in providing help for disasters and
risk management in the context of localized and short-term events associated with climate variability andextremes. Experience in disaster risk management includes both bottom-up and top-down approaches, but most
often has developed from disasters considered first as local issues, then at the national level, and only at theinternational level where needs exceed national capacity, especially in terms of humanitarian assistance and capacitybuilding. [7.2.4]
There are two main mechanisms at the international level that are purpose-built and dedicated to disaster
risk management and climate change adaptation. These are the United Nations International Strategy forDisaster Reduction (UNISDR) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),in particular in its adaptation components. This chapter focuses on these two bodies while recognizing that
there are many others that have an international role to play. Page limitations require a selective approach and acomprehensive assessment of all relevant bodies is impractical. The UNISDR and the UNFCCC are very differentinstitutions with different mandates and scope and objectives, and with varying strengths and capacities ( high
confidence ). Up to the present this fact has made the integration of disaster risk management and climate change
adaptation difficult to achieve ( medium confidence ). [7.3] The evolution of disaster risk management has come
from various directions: from the top down where legislation has required safe practice at operationallevels and from the local level up to the national and international levels. The evolution of climate changeadaptation has been driven primarily by the recognition of the global issue of anthropogenic climatechange ( high confidence ).[7.3]
In addition to the UNISDR and the UNFCCC, other areas of international law and practice are being used
to address climate change adaptation and disaster risk management. The relationship between legalaspirations and obligations in these areas of international action and management is complex and neitheris well understood or agreed upon ( high confidence ). Other areas include international refugee law, which has
been invoked to deal with the displacement of people that might be in part attributed to climate change; humanrights law as used by citizens against states for climate change impacting on the enjoyment of human rights; and theattempts to expand existing legal doctrines such as the emerging ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine to motive statesto act on climate change. Such attempts to use tools from other areas of international law to address climate change
adaptation and disaster risk reduction challenges have generally not been successful. [7.2.5]
International action on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation can be motivated both by
national interests and a concern for the common (global) public good. [7.2] The interdependence of the global
economy, the public good, and the transboundary nature of risk management, and the potential of regional risk pooling,
can make international cooperation on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation more economically efficient
than national or sub-national action alone. Notions of solidarity and equity motivate addressing disaster risk reduction
and climate change adaptation at the international level in part because developing countries are more vulnerable to
physical disasters. [7.2]
Closer integration at the international level of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, and
the mainstreaming of both into international development and development assistance, could foster
efficiency in the use of available and committed resources and capacity ( high confidence ).[7.4] Neither
disaster risk reduction nor climate change adaptation is as well integrated as they could be into current development
policies and practices. Both climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction might benefit from sharing ofExecutive Summary397Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales
knowledge and experience in a mutually supportive and synergistic way. Climate change adaptation could be factored
into all disaster risk management, and weather-related disasters are becoming an essential component of the adapta tion
agenda. [7.4]
Opportunities exist to create synergies in international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation
to climate change, but these have not yet been fully realized ( high confidence ).International funding for
disaster risk reduction remains relatively low as compared to the scale of spending on international humanitarianresponse. [7.4.2] Governments have committed to mobilize greater amounts of funding for climate change adaptationand this may also help to support the longer-term investments necessary for disaster risk reduction. [7.4.2]
Expanded international financial support for climate change adaptation as specified in the Cancun
Agreements of 2010 and the Climate Change Green Fund will facilitate and strengthen disaster riskmanagement ( medium confidence ).The agreements to provide substantial additional finance at the international
level for adaptation to climate change have been formulated to include climate- and weather-related disaster riskreduction. There is therefore some prospect that projects and planning for disaster risk reduction and climate changeadaptation can increasingly be combined and integrated at the national level ( high confidence ). [7.3.2.2, 7.4]
Technology transfer and cooperation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
has until recently focused more on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions than on adaptation ( high
confidence ). Technology for disaster risk management, especially to advance and strengthen forecasting and warning
systems and emergency response, is promoted through the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), but is widely dispersedamong many international and national-level organizations and is not closely linked to the UNISDR. Technology transferand cooperation to advance disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation are important. Coordination ontechnology transfer and cooperation between these two fields has been lacking, which has led to fragmentedimplementation ( high confidence ). [7.4]
International financial institutions, bilateral donors, and other international actors have played a catalytic role in the
development of catastrophic risk transfer and other risk-sharing instruments in the more vulnerable countries.Stronger products and methods for risk sharing and risk transfer are being developed as a relatively newand expanding area of international cooperation to help achieve climate change adaptation and disasterrisk reduction ( high confidence ). [7.4] Established mechanisms include remittances, post-disaster credit, and
insurance and reinsurance. Partly in response to concerns about climate change, additional insurance instruments arein various stages of development and expansion including international risk pools and weather index micro-insurance.These processes and products are being developed by international financial institutions as well as by nongovernmentalorganizations and the private sector. [7.4.4.2]
One lesson from disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation is that stronger efforts at the
international level do not necessarily lead to substantive and rapid results on the ground and at the locallevel. There is room for improved integration across scales from international to local ( high confidence ).
[7.6] The expansion of disaster risk reduction through the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
(1990-1999), and the establishment of the UNISDR and the creation and adoption of the HFA have had results that
are difficult to specify or to quantify – but which may have contributed to some reduction in morbidity and mortality,
while enjoying much less success in the area of economic and property losses. The problems of disaster risk have
continued to grow due in large part to the relentless expansion in exposure and vulnerability even as the international
management capacity has expanded ( medium confidence ). [7.5, 7.6]398Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales
7.1. The International Level
of Risk Management
7.1.1. Context and Background
A need to cope with the risks associated with atmospheric processes
(floods, droughts, cyclones, and so forth) has always been a fact of humanlife (Lamb, 1995). In more recent decades, extreme weather events have
increasingly come to be associated with large-scale disasters and an
increasing level of economic losses (Chapters 2 and 4). Considerable
experience has accumulated at the international (as well as local andnational) level on ways of coping with or managing the risks.
The same cannot be said for the risks associated with anthropogenic
climate change. These are new risks identified as possibilities orprobabilities (IPCC 1990, 1996, 2007).
Acceptance of climate change and its growing impacts has led to a
stronger emphasis on the need for adaptation, as exemplified, forexample, in the Bali Action Plan (adopted at the 13th Session of theConference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (UNFCCC, 2007a) and theCancun Agreements of December 2010.
The international community is thus faced with a contrast between a
long record of managing disasters and the risks of ‘normal’ climateextremes, and the new problem of adaptation to anthropogenic climatechange and its associated changes in variability and extremes. It hasbeen asked how the comparatively new field of anthropogenic climatechange adaptation (CCA) can benefit from the longer experience indisaster risk management (DRM). That question is a major focus of thisSpecial Report.
Climate extremes can have both negative and positive effects. The
occurrence of extreme events has raised consciousness of climate changewithin the public and in policymakers. This can then help to enhance asense of priority to governmental action in terms of supporting DRM,enhancing adaptation, and promoting mitigation (Adger et al., 2005).An international framework for integration of climate-related DRM and
CCA in the development process could provide the potential for reducingexposure and vulnerability (Thomalla et al., 2006; Venton and La Trobe,
2008). Collective efforts at the international level to reduce greenhouse
gases are a way to reduce long-term exposure to frequent and moreintense climate extremes. International frameworks designed to facilitateadaptation with a deliberate effort to address issues of equity, technology
transfer, globalization, and the need to meet the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) can, when combined with mitigation, lead to reduced
vulnerabi lity (Adger et al., 2005; Haines et al., 2006). The 2007/2008 Human
Development Report noted that if climate change is not adequately
addressed now, 40% of the world’s poorest (i.e., 2.6 billion people) will
be confined to a future of diminished opportunity (Stern, 2007; Watkins,2007). The long-term potential to reducing exposure to climate risks lies
in sustainable development (O’Brien et al., 2008). Both seek to buildresilience through sustainable development (O’Brien et al., 2008).Some claim that DRM and CCA could be realized through increased
awareness and use of synergies and differences, and by the provision ofa framework for integration in areas of overlap between the two(Venton and La Trobe, 2008). The World Conference on DisasterReduction held in Kobe (UNISDR, 2005c), Hyogo Prefecture, Japan in2005 and the Bali Action Plan both point to the need for incorporationof measures that can reduce climate change impacts within the practiceof disaster risk reduction (DRR). Integration of the relevant aspects ofDRR and CCA can be facilitated by using the Hyogo Framework forAction (2005-2015) as agreed by 168 governments in Kobe (UNISDR,2005a).
7.1.2. Related Questions and Chapter Structure
Within the context of the overarching question – how can experiencewith disaster risk management inform and help with climate changeadaptation? – there are a series of other related issues to be addressedin this chapter in order to provide a basis for their closer integration. Afirst question concerns the rationale for disaster risk management andclimate change adaptation at the international level. The issues ofsystemic risks and international security, economic efficiency, solidarity,and subsidiarity are addressed in Section 7.2.
A second topic concerns the nature and development of institutions and
capacity at the international level. This topic is explored in Section 7.3concentrating on the Hyogo Framework for Action and the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
A third issue concerns the opportunities for and constraints on disaster
risk management and climate change adaptation at the internationallevel. These include the matters of legal, financial, technology, risktransfer, and cooperation, and the creation of knowledge and itsmanagement and dissemination. All are addressed in Section 7.4.
Considerations of future policy and research are addressed in Section
7.5.
The challenge of bringing lessons from disaster risk reduction to climate
change adaptation takes on a different complexion at different temporaland spatial scales. The question of integration across scales is taken upin Section 7.6.
7.2. Rationale for International Action
This section provides a brief overview of selected concepts and principlesthat have been invoked to justify (or restrain) financing, assistance,regulation, and other types of international policy interventions fordisaster risk management and climate change adaptation. There is noattempt to be comprehensive, and additional principles are discussed inSection 7.2.5. Starting from the reality that risks of extreme weather andrisk management interventions cross national borders and transcend399single nation policies and procedures, this section discusses the
systemic nature of these risks and their effects on international security
before turning to a discussion of efficiency, shared responsibility , and
subsidiarity as these principles have shaped international discourse,
practices, and legal obligations within existing frameworks andconventions.
7.2.1. Systemic Risks and International Security
The term ‘systemic risk’ refers to risks that are characterized by linkages
and interdependencies in a system, where the failure of a single entityor cluster of entities can cause cascading impacts on other interlinkedentities. Because of greatly increased international interdependency,
shocks occurring in one country can potentially have major and bi-
directional systemic impacts on other parts of the world (Kleindorfer,2009), although the full extent of these impacts is not well documented.Moreover, major interlinked events, such as melting of glaciers, will bringincreased levels of hazard to specific areas, and the initial impacts ofsuch changes can extend to second- and third-order impacts (Alexander,2006). This can apply to the contiguous zones of many countries, such asshared basins with associated flood risks, which calls for transboundary,international mechanisms (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2001). 
Relationships and connections involving the movement of goods
(trade), finance (capital flows and remittances), and people (displacedpopulations) can also have transboundary impacts as discussed below.Moreover, actions in one country impact another, for example, clearingforests in an upstream riparian country can increase flood risksdownstream. Chastened by the unexpected systemic cascading of the2007-2008 financial crisis, firms with global supply chains are nowdevoting significant resources to crisis management and disruption riskmanagement (Sheffi, 2005; Harrington and O’Connor, 2009).
A few examples can illustrate the cascading nature of the financial and
economic impacts from disaster. Due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, theInternational Energy Agency announced a coordinated drawdown ofEuropean and Asian oil stocks totaling 60 million barrels (Bambergerand Kumins, 2005), and reportedly oil prices rose not only in the United
States but also as far away as Canada and the United Kingdom.Disasters also have an impact on international trade. Using a gravitymodel across 170 countries (1962-2005), Gassebner et al. (2010)conclude that an additional disaster reduces imports on average by
0.2% and exports by 0.1%. The main conditions determining the impactof disastrous events on trade are the level of democracy and the
geographical size of the affected country.
Turning specifically to displaced persons as a cascading impact,
estimates of the numbers of current and future migrants due not onlyto disasters but generally to environmental change are divergent andcontroversial (Myers, 2001; Christian Aid, 2007). A middle-rangeestimate puts the figure at 200 million by 2050 (Brown, 2008). Lookingonly at extreme weather as a cause of migration, a recent reportestimates that over 20 million people were displaced due to sudden-
onset climate-related disasters in 2008 (OCHA/IDMC, 2009). This reportand others, however, acknowledge the difficulty of disentangling thedrivers of migration, including climate change risks, rising poverty,spread of infectious diseases, and conflict (Castles, 2002; Myers, 2005;Thomalla et al., 2006; Barnett and Adger 2007; CIENS, 2007; Dun andGemenne, 2008; Guzmán, 2009; Morrissey, 2009).
As opposed to abrupt displacement due to extreme weather events,
mobility and migration can also be an adaptation strategy to gradualclimatic change (Barnett and Webber, 2009), which normally leads toslower migration shifts. However, the very poor and vulnerable will inmany cases be unable to move (Tacoli, 2009). To the extent that weatherextremes contribute to migration, it can result in a huge burden to thedestination areas (Barnett and Adger, 2007; Heltberg et al., 2008;Morrissey, 2009; Tacoli, 2009; Warner et al., 2009a). As part of thisburden, the conflict potential of migration depends to a significantdegree on how the government and people in the transit, destination,or place of return respond. Governance, the degree of political stability,the economy, and whether there is a history of violence are generallyimportant factors (Kolmannskog, 2008).
The international impacts of climate-related disasters can extend
beyond financial consequences, international trade, and migration, andaffect human security more generally. O’Brien et al. (2008) report on theintricate and systemic linkages between DRR, CCA, and human security,and they emphasize the importance of confronting the societal context,including development levels, governance, inequality, and culturalpractices. A further rationale for disaster risk reduction in the face ofclimate change at the international scale thus places emphasis on ethicalissues and the growing connections among people and places in coupledsocial-ecological systems.
7.2.2. Economic Efficiency
The public policy literature describes situations in which governmentintervention is justified to address market deficiencies and inefficiencies,a rationale that can also be applied to international interventions. Stern(2007) makes the case that adaptation will not happen autonomouslybecause of inefficiencies in resource allocation brought about by missingand misaligned markets. As a case in point, markets do not allocateresources efficiently in the case of public goods, which are goods thatmeet two conditions: the consumption of the good by one individualdoes not reduce availability of the good for consumption by others; andno one can be effectively excluded from using the good. Tompkins andAdger (2005) and Berkhout (2005) discuss how some areas, such aswater resources, change from being public to private depending onnational regulations and circumstances. Nevertheless, the principles ofinterdependence and public goods suggested by Stern and others (andwhich lead to inefficient allocation of resources) are frequently noted inthe literature on international responsibility (Stern, 2007; Vernon, 2008;Gupta et al., 2010; World Bank, 2010a).Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales400Early warning systems (as an example of a public good) can depend on
regional and international cooperation to make more efficient use ofclimate data through its exchange. In the field of meteorology, manyyears of discussion under the auspices of the World MeteorologicalOrganization (WMO) have led to formal agreements on the types ofdata that are routinely exchanged (WMO, 1995; Basher, 2006). Thereare similar levels of agreement in other hazard fields, for instance,sharing resources and expertise in managing floods at the river basinscale. As another example of enhanced efficiency through internationalcooperation, many Caribbean countries have formed a catastropheinsurance pool to reduce reinsurance premiums (see Sections 6.3.3 and7.4, and Case Study 9.2.13). 
7.2.3. Shared Responsibility
It is not only efficiency claims that can be invoked to justify internationalinterventions, but also considerations of shared responsibility andsolidarity, especially with those least able to cope with the impacts ofextreme events and changes in them due to climate change. Thissubsection makes reference to selected principles found in the currentliterature on adaptation to weather-related extremes; there is noattempt to comprehensively assess the moral and ethical literature onthis topic.
In the words of the Millennium Declaration that was adopted by 189
nations in September 2000:“We recognize that, in addition to ourseparate responsibilities to our individual societies, we have a collectiveresponsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality andequity at the global level. Global challenges must be managed in a waythat distributes the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with basicprinciples of equity and social justice. Those who suffer or who benefitleast deserve help from those who benefit most” (UNGA, 2000).
In the poorest countries, people have a higher burden in terms of loss of
life per event and loss of their assets relative to their income. Based onhistorical loss data from Munich Re, average fatalities for major disasterevents have been approximately 40 times higher in low-income as
compared to high-income countries (groupings according to the World
Bank), and direct asset losses as a percentage of gross national incomehave averaged three times greater (Barnett et al., 2008; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2010). Changes in frequency, magnitude, and spatial coverageof some climate extremes (see Table 3-1) can result in losses that exceedthe capability of many individual countries to manage the risk(Rodriguez et al., 2009). Many have concluded that without significant
international assistance the most vulnerable countries will have difficulty
in adapting to changes in extreme events and their impacts due to climate
change, as well as other impacts of climate change (Agrawala and
Fankhauser, 2008; Agrawala and van Aalst, 2008; Klein and Persson,2008; Klein and Möhner, 2009; Gupta and van de Grijp, 2010; Gupta etal., 2010; World Bank, 2010a). Shared responsibility can take the formof ex-ante interventions to reduce vulnerability and poverty, as well as
ex-post disaster response and assistance.Weather extremes constrain progress toward meeting the MDGs as
expressed in the Millennium Declaration, especially the goal of eradicatingextreme poverty and hunger (UNDP , 2002; Mirza, 2003; Watkins, 2007;UNISDR, 2009a), which can be interpreted as a direct raison d’être forinternational intervention in risk management (UNISDR, 2005b;Heltberg et al., 2008). Barrett et al. (2007) have shown that ex-ante riskmanagement strategies on the part of the poor commonly sacrificeexpected gains, such as investing in improved seed, to reduce risk ofsuffering catastrophic loss, a situation perpetuating the ‘poverty trap.’The poor can be subject to multiple exposures from climate changeand other stresses like geophysical hazards and changing economicconditions (e.g., fluctuating exchange rates) leading to vulnerability toeven moderate hazard events (O’Brien and Leichenko, 2000).
Shared responsibility and common human concern have been articulated
most effectively with regard to post-disaster humanitarian assistance,and the Millennium Declaration gives specific mention to ‘natural’disasters in this context. Section VI (Protecting the Vulnerable) states: “Wewill spare no effort to ensure that children and all civilian populationsthat suffer disproportionately the consequences of natural disasters …are given every assistance and protection so that they can resume normallife as soon as possible.” With growing globalization the principle ofshared responsibility is further enhanced as offers of disaster relief mayprovide nations access to new spheres of influence both politically andin terms of new business opportunities. Governments can piggyback ahumanitarian effort on top of a for-profit operation involving privatecompanies (Dunfee and Hess, 2000). 
Disasters can overwhelm the coping mechanisms of nations, in which
case international relief and assistance, as a form of solidarity, arerequired as a matter of saving lives. Humanitarian assistance willremain essential, but emphasizing disaster response strategies at theexpense of proactive integrated approaches to disaster risk reductioncan have the effect of perpetuating vulnerability (UNDP , 2002; Bhatt,2007). For this reason, the DRR and CCA communities are placing greatemphasis on pre-disaster investment and planning to redress this balanceand reduce overall costs of disaster management (Kreimer and Arnold,2000; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005). These efforts include encouragingthe humanitarian community to become a stronger advocate of DRRand CCA.
Beyond a sense of common human concern, it can be argued that
countries contributing most to climate change have an obligation topay to reduce or compensate losses. This is the principle underlying the‘polluter pays principle.’ In addition, it can be claimed that countrieshave a ‘principled’ obligation to support those who are most vulnerableand who have made a limited contribution to the creation of the climatechange problem. This is the claim underlying the expression of ‘commonbut differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ (CBDR),which has emerged as one principle of international environmental law(De Lucia, 2007) and has been explicitly formulated in the context ofthe 1992 Rio Earth Summit (and subsequently in the Preamble andArticle 3 of the UNFCCC). “In view of the different contributions to global
Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales401environmental degradation, States have common but differentiated
responsibilities. The developed countries acknowledge the responsibilitythat they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development inview of the pressures their societies place on the global environment andof the technologies and financial resources they command.” (Principle 7,the Rio Declaration; UNCED, 1992). The CBDR is discussed further inSection 7.2.5. For purposes here it is important to note that, whilethe CBDR principle can apply to climate change in general, includingincremental change, it is relevant to climate-related disasters only if thereis evidence or reason to believe that the disaster would not have occurredor would have been less severe in the absence of climate change.
Another set of literature (e.g., Adger et al., 2009; Caney, 2010) frames
equity issues around climate change in terms of ‘rights,’ namely the right‘not to suffer from dangerous climate change’ or ‘to avoid dangerousclimate change’ (Adger, 2004; Caney, 2008). The ‘rights’ argument,which is highly relevant to international solidarity, can be extended tosuggest that individuals and collectives have the right to be protectedfrom risk and disaster imposed by others through the processes thatlead to social exclusion, marginality, exposure, and vulnerability.According to this literature, climate change impacts can jeopardizefundamental rights to life and livelihood (such as impacts on diseaseburden, malnutrition, and food security). Caney (2010, p. 83) alsodiscusses a potential further undeniable right, ‘not to be forciblyevicted.’ This framing, however, raises a number of difficult issuesbecause of competing fundamental rights (O’Brien et al., 2009). 
7.2.4. Subsidiarity
The principle of ‘subsidiarity’ can be invoked to support a case against
international intervention. It is best known as articulated in Article 5 ofthe Treaty of Maastricht on European Union (Maastricht Treaty, 1992). Itis based on the concept that centralized governing structures shouldonly take action if deemed more effective or necessary than action atlower levels (Jordan, 2000; Craeynest et al., 2010). The intent is tostrengthen accountability and reduce the dangers of making decisionsin places remote from their point of application (Gupta and Grubb,
2000). In Europe, the principle of subsidiarity has been interpreted to
mean, for example, that international- or national-level involvement in
flood protection should only apply to cross-border catchments (Stoiber,2006). While many regions and river basins are required to develop risk
management flood plans, flood protection is considered predominantly
a national, and in many countries (e.g., Germany and India), primarily a
sub-national (state) responsibility.
The principle also recognizes that multi-level governance requires
cooperation between all levels of government (Begg, 2008). As anexample of this cooperation, in 2004, the African Union developed a
continent-wide African Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction
(African Union, 2010). Below the continental level, disaster managementstrategies are developed at the regional level (e.g., under the
Regional Economic Communities), national level (e.g., National DisasterManagement platforms), district level (e.g., District Disaster Management
Committees), and local levels (e.g., Village Development Committees).Action at any one level can affect all others in a reflexive fashion. 
7.2.5. Legal Obligations
7.2.5.1. Scope of International Law,
Managing Risks, and Adaptation
Contemporary international law concerns the coexistence of states in
times of war and of peace (19th-century conception of internationallaw, rooted in the Westphalian system), the relationship between a stateand citizens (e.g., human rights law), and the cooperation between
states and other international actors in order to achieve common goals
and address common concerns (e.g., international environmental law).International law, according to the authoritative Article 38 of the Statuteof the International Court of Justice, emanates from three primarysources: (1) international conventions, which establish “rules expresslyrecognized by the … state s,” and result from a deliberate process of
negotiations; (2) international custom, “as evidence of a general practiceaccepted as law”; and (3) general principles of law, “recognized by civilized nations” (see also Birnie et al., 2009). This triumvirate ofconventional and customary international law, and general principles oflaw, contains legal norms and obligations that can be used to motivate,justify, and facilitate international cooperation on climate changeadaptation, such as contained within the UNFCCC, and in anticipationof and response to natural disasters, such as with the emerging field ofinternational disaster relief law. 
In addition to international sources of ‘hard law,’ ‘soft law’ principles
also exist in the form of non-legally binding resolutions, guidelines,codes of conduct (Chinkin, 1989; Bodansky, 2010), and other non-legallybinding instruments adopted by states. Collectively, hard law and softlaw provide a framework within which states have obligations (hardlaw) or commitments (soft law) of relevance to adapting to climatechange and disaster risk management. These include obligations tomitigate the effects of drought (United Nations Convention to CombatDesertification), to formulate and implement measures to facilitateadaptation (UNFCCC; see Section 7.3.2), to exercise precaution (RioDeclaration), for international cooperation to protect and promotehuman rights (OHCHR, 2009, para. 84 et seq.), and to develop nationallegislation to address disaster risk reduction (HFA; see Section 7.3.1). 
At the same time as international law appears to provide a normative
framework and to create an obligation to “implement … measures tofacilitate adequate adaptation to climate change” (UNFCCC Article 4.1(b)),the literature suggests that taken together, international legal instru ments
are not equipped to fully facilitate climate adaptation and to reducedisaster risk. To illustrate, the law of international disaster response,which aims to establish a legal framework for transborder disaster reliefand recovery, has been characterized as “dispersed, with gaps of scope,geographic coverage and precision” (Fisher, 2007), with states beingChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales402“hesitant to negotiate and accept far-reaching treaties that impose
legally binding responsibilities with respect to disaster preparedness,protection, and response” (Fidler, 2005). A second example, internationalrefugee law, does not recognize environmental factors as grounds forgranting refugee status to those displaced across borders as a result ofenvironmental factors (Kibreab, 1997).
7.2.5.2. International Conventions
Few internationally negotiated treaties deal, at the international level,with managing risk associated with climate extremes or with adaptationto climate change. As the primary treaty to address climate-related riskmanagement at the international level, the UNFCCC commits Parties to
facilitate adequate adaptation, to cooperate with planning for extreme
weather, and to consider insurance schemes, though at present it isunresolved as to whether this implies international insurance schemes.Specifically, in Article 4.1(b), Parties to the UNFCCC agree to “formulate,implement, publish and regularly update national and, where appropriate,regional programmes containing … measures to facilitate adequateadaptation to climate change.” In Article 4.1(e), Parties agree to“cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change;develop and elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zonemanagement, water resources and agriculture, and for the protectionand rehabilitation of areas, particularly in Africa, affected by drought anddesertification, as well as flood s.” Article 4.8 of the UNFCCC commits
Parties to consider actions “including related to funding, insurance andthe transfer of technology” to meet the specific needs and concerns ofdeveloping countries. In Article 3.14, UNFCCC’s Kyoto Protocol considersthe establishment of funding, insurance, and transfer of technology (seealso Sections 7.4.2, 7.4.3, and 7.4.4).
In addition to the UNFCCC, Parties to the United Nations Convention to
Combat Desertification aim to “combat desertification and mitigate theeffects of drought in countries experiencing serious drought and/ordesertification … through effective action at all levels, supported byinternational cooperation and partnership arrangements” (Article 2). 
The Tampere Convention on the Provision of Telecommunication Resources
for Disaster Mitigation and Relief Operations is the only contemporary
multilateral treaty on the topic of disaster relief (Fidler, 2005). Aiming toreduce regulatory barriers for important equipment for disaster response,and entered into force in 2005, the Tampere Convention’s first applicationhas been met with limited success, due primarily to limited membership
of many of the most vulnerable states (Fisher, 2007).
7.2.5.3. Customary Law and Soft Law Principles
Customary law and soft law principles, unlike international conventions,
emerge from informal processes and do not exist in canonical form
(Bodansky, 2010, p. 192 et seq.), though such customary law and softlaw principles are often reflected in international treaties. This is thereality of various customs and principles that justify or mandate
international action on disaster risk reduction and climate changeadaptation. To be established as customary law, two elements arerequisite: evidence of generally uniform and continuous state practice(regular behavior), and evidence that this practice is motivated by a senseof legal obligation ( opinio juris ) (Bodansky, 1995). Soft law principles of
law, by contrast, are not customary norms and do not reflect behavioralregularities. They are rather an articulation of collective aspiration,
important in shaping the “development of international law andnegotiations to develop more precise norms” (Bodansky, 2010, p. 200).In practice, the distinction between rules of customary law (reflectingactual practice of states following a legal obligation) and soft lawprinciples is frequently blurred. For instance, the principle of common butdifferentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities – which wouldfor example suggest that states have differentiated responsibilities inaddressing disaster risk and financing adaptation – is increasinglysupported by state practice, however opinio juris is lacking as it is unclear
whether most states consider the principle to be a legal obligation. Theprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities and respectivecapabilities might thus fall closer to a general principle than a customarynorm. Irrespective of this status, the principle of common but differentiatedresponsibilities and respective capabilities is nevertheless a principlethat states may apply in their international relations, even if it is not anorm of customary international law. 
The precautionary principle states that scientific uncertainty does not
justify inaction with respect to environmental risks (Trouwborst, 2002),and is articulated in a number of international instruments includingPrinciple 15 of the Rio Declaration, and Article 3 of the UNFCCC. Thatstates have a duty to prevent transboundary harm, provide notice of, andundertake consultations with respect to such potential harms is a softlaw norm expressed under international environmental law. The moregeneral duty to cooperate has evolved as a result of the inapplicabilityof the law of state responsibility to problems of multilateral concern,such as global environmental challenges. The Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights has noted that “climate change canonly be effectively addressed through cooperation of all members of theinternational community” (OHCHR, 2009). From the duty to cooperateis deduced a duty to notify other states of potential environmentalharm. This is reflected in Principles 18 and 19 of the Rio Declaration (anon-legal international instrument), that “States shall immediately notifyother States of any natural disasters or other emergencies that are likelyto produce sudden harmful effects on the environment of those States”(Rio Principle 18) and “States shall provide prior and timely notificationand relevant information to potentially affected States on activities thatmay have a significant adverse transboundary environmental effect”(Rio Principle 19). 
7.2.5.4. Non-Legally Binding Instruments
Many international instruments are non-legal in nature (Raustiala,2005). This is the case with respect to disaster relief where many of theChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales403most significant international instruments are non-binding. Illustrative are
the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red CrescentMovement and Nongovernmental Organizations in Disaster Relief (ICRC,1995) and the Sphere Project, Humanitarian Charter and MinimumStandards in Disaster Response (Sphere Project, 2004), which focus on thequality of relief developed by the international humanitarian community.These are limited by lack of compliance mechanisms (Fidler, 2005), aswell as in their application, as they are the creation of internationalnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and are rarely recognized in thepolicies of national governments. The Guiding Principles on InternalDisplacement (Cohen, 1998) articulate principles of disaster preventionand of human vulnerability (Fisher, 2007). 
International human rights norms as articulated in the International Bill
of Human Rights have also been applied to disaster risk reduction andadaptation to climate change. Notably, the Report of the Office of theHigh Commission for Human Rights observes that climate change andresponse measures thereto can have a negative effect on the realizationof human rights including rights to life, adequate food, water, health,adequate housing, and self-determination (OHCHR, 2009). These rightscould risk being jeopardized when contemplated, for example, in thecontext of migration induced by extreme weather events. As discussedin Section 7.3.1, the HFA further stipulates key tasks for governmentsand multi-stakeholder actors; among these is the development of legalframeworks (UNISDR, 2005a, para. 22). The HFA is an internationalframework, a priority area of which is to ensure that disaster risk reduc tion
is a national priority with an institutional basis for implementation. Asto adaptation, the Bali Action Plan agreed to at the 13th Conference ofthe Parties to the UNFCCC recognizes the need to address considerationof disaster reduction strategies and risk management within adaptation(UNFCCC, 2007a). Adaptation is further addressed in the CancunAgreements (UNFCCC, 2010c).
7.3. Current International Governance
and Institutions
Among the many relevant frameworks and protocols administered by
a host of United Nations and other international agencies, the most
significant for this Special Report are the HFA, to reduce disaster risk,
and the UNFCCC, which includes adaptation to the adverse effects ofclimate change. Since both DRR and CCA occur within a broaderdevelopment context and are particularly relevant to the challenges
facing developing countries, they are indirectly connected to a third
important international framework: the MDGs.
The UNFCCC was adopted in 1992 following one year of negotiations
and was further complemented by the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997.The Convention came into force in 1994 and the Protocol in 2005. In
parallel, the DRR framework was adopted as a nonbinding instrumentin 2005 following two years of negotiations and is time bound – 2005to 2015. The HFA recognizes the relevance of addressing climate change
in order to reduce the risk of disasters and, as soon as adopted, the twoprocesses began to work together, collaborating closely in order to
synchronize frameworks and approaches so as to create added value tocurrent risk management initiatives. This IPCC Special Report is oneexample of the initiatives taken by governments. It is one of the firstofficial products of the two communities working within different butrelated policy frameworks. 
This section first introduces the HFA and the UNFCCC, including an
overview of their respective objectives, legal nature, and status ofimplementation. It then presents relevant international actors involved
in implementing these two frameworks, as well as a summary of otherrelevant international policy frameworks and agencies.
7.3.1. The Hyogo Framework for Action
7.3.1.1. Evolution and Description
The first major collective international attempt to reduce disaster impact,
particularly within hazard-prone developing countries, took place in1989, when the United Nations (UN) General Assembly designated the1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction(IDNDR) (Wisner et al., 2004). About 120 National Committees wereestablished and in 1994, the first World Conference on Natural DisasterReduction was held in Yokohama, Japan. The conference produced the‘Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action,’ providing policy guidance witha strong technical and scientific focus.
In 2000, the IDNDR was followed by the United Nations International
Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), which broadened the technicaland policy scope of the IDNDR to include increased social action, publiccommitment, and linkages to sustainable development. The UNISDRsystem promotes tools and methods to reduce disaster risk whileencouraging collaboration between disaster reduction and climatechange. The UNISDR Secretariat provides information and guidance ondisaster risk reduction and has increasingly widened its focus to embraceadaptation to climate change. The strategy undertakes global reviews ofdisaster risk and promotes national initiatives to reduce disaster risk.The UNISDR has also promoted the development of National Platforms.A key function is to assist in the compilation, exchange, analysis, anddissemination of good practices and lessons learned in disaster riskreduction (refer to Section 7.4.5).
In January 2005, just three weeks after the Indian Ocean tsunami, the
second World Conference on Disaster Reduction was held in Kobe,Japan. 168 governments adopted the Hyogo Framework for Action2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities toDisasters. The adoption of the framework directly after a devastatingtsunami gave the framework high visibility in many countries. The HFAwas unanimously endorsed by the UN General Assembly (UNISDR, 2005a).The HFA is not a binding agreement: the governments simply agreedand adopted the framework as a set of recommendations to be utilizedvoluntarily. In international law it can be described as ‘soft law.’ SomeChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales404regard the voluntary nature of the HFA as a useful flexible commitment,
largely based on self-regulation and trust, while others regard this as itsinherent weakness (Pelling, 2011, p. 44).
The HFA’s Strategic Goals include the integration of DRR into sustainable
development policies and planning; development and strengthening ofinstitutions, mechanisms, and capacities to build resilience to hazards;and the systematic incorporation of risk reduction approaches into thedesign and implementation of emergency preparedness, response, andrecovery programs (UNISDR, 2005a). The Framework also provides fivePriorities for Action:
1)Ensure that DRR is a national and local priority, with a stronginstitutional basis for implementation
2)Identify, assess, and monitor disaster risks, and enhance earlywarning
3)Use knowledge, innovation, and education to build a culture ofsafety and resilience at all levels
4)Reduce the underlying risk factors
5)Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels.
The priorities address all hazards with a multi-hazard approach, hence
the inclusion of climate change risks and adaptation, but they do notspecify the need to factor climate change risks and adaptation intoongoing action. The HFA does identify ‘critical tasks’ for varied actors,including states who are to “promote the integration of DRR with cli mate
variability and climate change into DRR strategies and adaptation toclimate change” (UNISDR 2005a; see also UNISDR, 2009a, 2011a,b;World Bank, 2011a).
7.3.1.2. Status of Implementation
This section will review the various tools that have been used to measurethe performance of the HFA in fulfilling its Strategic Goals and Prioritiesfor Action.
The measurement of performance in the implementation of DRR was a
matter of considerable debate when the HFA was drafted. The consensus
was for the final text not to include targets or indicators of progress, but
countries were encouraged to develop their own guidelines to monitor
their own progress in reducing their risks. To assist this process, in 2008,
UNISDR published guidance notes on ‘Indicators of Progress’ (UNISDR,2008). This provided the template for self-assessment that is used innational reports. While there is an obvious value in ‘self-assessment’ asa learning experience, in the absence of external, objective evaluation,
inevitable doubts will always remain concerning such internal reporting
on actual progress with DRR and CCA.
The main instruments to encourage HFA applications are the HFA
Monitoring Service on PreventionWeb acting mainly as a guidance tool
for countries to monitor their own progress in DRR. This is a multi-tier
online tool for regional, national, and local progress review. Core
Indicators are measured for the five HFA Priorities for Action as notedbelow, and these are reported with detailed analysis in the Global
Assessment Reports (UNISDR, 2009a, 2011a; refer to Section 7.4.5). Inaddition to these biennial reports, the UNISDR has published a mid-termreview of progress in achieving the HFA (UNISDR, 2011b). Further toolsto measure progress include the reports to the biennial sessions of the
Global Platform for DRR and the regional platforms for DRR and other
similar mechanisms. The World Bank and the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) also utilize the HFA to guide theirsupport to national and local programs on DRR and gradually also forCCA (the HFA is also discussed in Sections 1.3.6 and 6.3.2).
As a result of the adoption of HFA, and the development of performance
indicators, global efforts to address DRR have become more systematic.In 2009, the first biennial Global Assessment Report (GAR) on DisasterRisk Reduction was released and in the same year the Global Networkof Civil Society Organisations for Disaster Reduction (GNDR) alsoreleased a report on the performance of the HFA (GNDR, 2009). The GAR
found that since the adoption of the HFA, progress toward decreasingdisaster risk is varied across scales. This variation is based on nationalgovernment agencies self-assessment of progress against the indicatorsdefined by the UNISDR (UNISDR, 2008) and since many of these indicatorsrequire a subjective assessment, progress is not directly comparableacross countries. 
Countries have been making improvements toward increasing capacity,
developing institutional systems, and legislation to promote DRR, andearly warning systems have been implemented in many areas. However,the Global Assessment Reports (UNISDR, 2009a, 2011a) conclude thatprogress is still required to mainstream DRR into public investment,development planning, and governance arrangements. During 2010, atthe mid-point in the HFA, the UN Secretary General echoed this concernin reporting that “risk reduction is still not hardwired into the ‘businessprocesses’ of the development sectors, planning ministries and financialinstitutions” (UNGA, 2010, p. 5). 
Further, both the GARs and the GNDR (2009, 2011) noted that at
national and international levels, policy and institutional frameworksfor climate change adaptation and poverty reduction are not yetsynchronized to those for DRR. For example, the 2011 GAR reports onweak coordination and separate management between institutionaland program mechanisms (UNISDR, 2011a, p. 150).
The GNDR observed that ecosystem management approaches can provide
multiple benefits, including risk reduction, and thus be a central part ofDRR strategies. But countries have experienced difficulty in addressingunderlying risk drivers (such as food security, social protection, buildingcodes/standards, poverty alleviation, poor urban and local governance,vulnerable rural livelihoods, and ecosystem decline) in a way that leadsto a reduction in the risk of damages and economic loss (GNDR, 2009).This Fourth HFA Priority for Action – ‘Reduce the Underlying Risk Factors’– remains the greatest challenge to civil society bodies, with all 13criteria only reaching a rating of 2 on the assessment scale: ‘some activitybut significant scope for improvements’ (GNDR, 2009, pp. 24–26). TheChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales405GARs also note this area of weakness, but note that it is possible for
countries to address underlying risk drivers using an assortment ofmechanisms to increase resilience (e.g., raising awareness, education,training, risk assessments, early warning systems, building safety, micro-insurance in macro-financing schemes) (UNISDR, 2009a, 2011a).
It was also acknowledged in the 2009 GAR that weather-related disaster
risk is escalating swiftly, in terms of the regions affected, frequencyof events, and losses reported. This frequency relates to occurrencepatterns as well as improved reporting of all categories of weather-related hazards. Data was collected from a sample of 12 Asian and LatinAmerican countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,the Indian states of Orissa and Tamil Nadu, Iran, Mexico, Nepal, Peru,Sri Lanka, and Venezuela. The report further noted that these increaseswill magnify the uneven distribution of risk between wealthier andpoorer countries (UNISDR, 2009a, p. 11). Furthermore, a conclusion isdrawn in the report that climate change is changing the geographicaldistribution, intensity, and frequency of these weather-related hazards,threatening to exceed the capacities of poorer countries and theircommunities’ abilities to absorb losses and recover from disasterimpacts (UNISDR, 2009b). However, the 2011 GAR reported significantprogress with a decrease in global mortality risk from tropical cyclones andflooding, with the only exception being South Asia where vulnerabilityis still increasing (UNISDR, 2011a, p. 28).
The 2009 and 2011 GARs, as well as the discussion they generated in
the Global Platforms of 2009, have brought a regional dimension toperformance assessment, in an effort to monitor progress.
When evaluating the progress of HFA on each of its five Priorities for
Action, the GNDR found that the lowest level of progress across all thefive priorities was at the lowest scale in community participation indecisionmaking on DRR (GNDR, 2009). These findings also indicate theneed for a stronger link between policy formulation at international andnational levels to policy execution at local levels. Rapid progress hasbeen made in the development of comprehensive seasonal and long-term early warning systems (EWS) to anticipate droughts, floods, andtropical storms. These systems have proved to be effective in saving
lives and protecting property. In the 2009 GAR, the status of EWS was
reviewed (UNISDR, 2009a, Box 5.2 on p. 127). This was based on adetailed progress review of EWS undertaken by WMO (WMO, 2009).Typical examples of the effectiveness of EWS in reducing the impact of
cyclones and flooding can be found in Mozambique, where their EWS
was first tested in a cyclone in 2007 (Foley, 2007) and in Bangladesh,where the flood and cyclone EWS has been progressively developed
over three decades (Paul et al., 2010; also see Case Study 9.2.11). 
A key finding concerned the importance of education and sharing
knowledge, including indigenous and traditional knowledge, and ensuringeasy and systematic access to best practice tools and international
standards, tailored to specific sectors (see Section 7.4.5). There is some
recognition of the benefits in harmonizing and linking the frameworks
and policies for DRM and CCA as core policy and programmatic objec tivesin national development plans and in support of poverty reduction
strategies. DRM policies also need to take account of climate change.Nevertheless, countries are making significant progress in strengtheningcapacities, institutional systems, and legislation to address deficienciesin disaster preparedness and response (GNDR, 2009; UNISDR, 2009a). 
In preparing for the mid-term review of the HFA, the UNISDR secretariat
commissioned a desk review of literature to form “a baseline of thedisaster risk reduction landscape.” Forty-seven key documents wereidentified, mainly consisting of reports from UNISDR offices and partnerorganizations: NGOs and international development banks (UNISDR,2011b).
The HFA Mid-Term Review 2010-2011 raised two important international
issues. The first need is to develop accountability mechanisms at alllevels to measure the actions taken and progress achieved in DRR. Thesecond need is for the international community to develop a morecoherent and integrated approach to support the implementation of theHFA. The review suggests that this will require connected action of thevaried international actors (UNISDR, 2011b).
However, it is important to reflect on the reality that all of these methods
to review international progress in risk reduction – country progressreports, the 2009 and 2011 GARs, the reports of the GNDR, and theMid-Term Review of the HFA – are all internally produced reports by theparticipating agencies with external advisory boards and peer review,but all involving self-assessment. The GNDR’s publications are fullyindependent from the UN and governments, but make no claim to bescientifically accurate assessments. The country HFA reports are onlineat www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/progress/?pid:73&pih:2. 
All the above studies attempted to assess HFA performance and, as
noted above, none were totally separate from the work or institutionsbeing assessed. Furthermore, none looked specifically at the performanceof the lead organization, UNISDR, in comparison with other multilateralbodies. This report came in 2011, when the UK Aid Agency, theDepartment for International Development (DFID), published aMultilateral Aid Review. The purpose was to ensure maximum value formoney for UK aid by examining the performance of 43 multilateralorganizations. This peer-reviewed assessment placed the UNISDR in a43rd-ranked position in an assessment of 43 multilateral organizations(DFID, 2011).
This independent and comparative assessment included an evaluation
of UNISDR since its foundation and identified its strength as globalcoordinator of the three Global Platforms in DRR that have beensuccessful in advocacy and raising awareness. However, the assessmentalso identified a series of shortcomings in UNISDR. They included its poorperformance in international coordination and its focus on national-level
responses rather than its global mandate, which is broad rather thanspecific in focus. Further criticisms include inadequate attention tostrategic considerations as well as leadership failures, with the reportstating that there was no clear line of sight from UNISDR’s mandate, to
Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales406a strategy, to an implementation plan and that there was an absence of
a results-based framework, thus making it difficult to measure resultsfrom input to output (DFID, 2011, p. 211). 
UNISDR responded to the assessment by noting that the criticisms were
also reflected in a UN audit as well as in an external evaluation requestedby UNISDR in 2009, and that changes had now been incorporated in amanagement-reform work program (UNISDR, 2011c).
Whatever method is adopted to monitor progress with risk reduction
and climate change adaptation (internal or external, self-assessment orpeer review), the implicit problems faced in the measurement of DRRand CCA before a disaster event must be recognized. It is not easy, evenwith detailed objective scientific measurement, to accurately determinewhether a given structural or non-structural measure will actuallyprovide the necessary level of protection to people and property underextreme hazard loads. Structural tests can be carried out and simulationexercises can be usefully conducted to test warning systems or theeffectiveness of preparedness, but at best such performance tests canonly approximate disaster reality. The ultimate test of DRR and CCAapplications will inevitably need to await the impact of the next disaster.But this limitation does not remove the requirement to monitor andmeasure progress in an objective scientific manner to the upper limitsof existing knowledge (Davis, 2004). 
7.3.2. The United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change
7.3.2.1. Evolution and Description
The UNFCCC is a multilateral treaty aimed at addressing climate change.
Its ultimate objective as stated in Article 2 is (UN, 1992; see alsoOppenheimer and Petsonk, 2005):
“to achieve … stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in theatmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenicinterference with the climate system. Such a level should be achievedwithin a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturallyto climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened
and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable
manner.”
The UNFCCC was negotiated from February 1991 to May 1992, and
opened for signature at the UN Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. It entered into force on 21
March 1994, and since 1995 the Conference of the Parties (COP) to theUNFCCC has met in yearly sessions. The rules, institutions, and proceduresof the UNFCCC have been described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Yamin and
Depledge, 2004; Bodansky, 2005). The development of adaptation as apriority under the UNFCCC has been analyzed by Schipper (2006).
A major thrust of the UNFCCC and subsequent negotiations about its
implementation concerns the mitigation of climate change: all policiesand measures aimed at reducing the emission of greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide (CO
2), or at retaining and capturing them in sinks
such as forests, oceans, and underground reservoirs. As mentioned bySchipper (2006), adaptation to climate change was initially given littlepriority, although it is subject to various commitments in the UNFCCC
(see Box 7-1). When taken together, these commitments acknowledge
the systematic nature of climate change risks and the relevance of theprinciples of economic efficiency, solidarity, and subsidiarity in adapta tion.
The Kyoto Protocol, agreed at COP3 in 1997 and in force since 2005,
sets binding targets for 37 industrialized countries and the EuropeanUnion for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5%compared to 1990 over the five year period 2008-2012. Adaptation isall but absent in the Kyoto Protocol, with two exceptions. Article 10(b)specifies that Parties shall formulate, implement, publish, and regularlyupdate national and, where appropriate, regional programs containingmeasures to mitigate climate change and measures to facilitate adequateadaptation to climate change. Article 12.8, on the Clean DevelopmentMechanism, provides the basis of what later became the AdaptationFund (see Section 7.4.2).
7.3.2.2. Status of Implementation
There is to date no overall assessment of progress on adaptation underthe UNFCCC in the way that the UNISDR has assessed progress underthe HFA in the GARs. However, Parties to the UNFCCC are required tosubmit National Communications on their activities toward implementingthe UNFCCC, including adaptation. There is no common reportingtemplate so reports vary widely in content, making aggregation orcomparison problematic. The annual sessions of the COP also allowcountries to assess their progress toward meeting their commitmentsunder the UNFCCC, and to negotiate and adopt new decisions for furtherimplementation. By June 2011, there were 195 Parties to the UNFCCC:194 countries and one regional economic integration organization (theEuropean Union).
During the 1990s, adaptation received little attention in the UNFCCC
negotiations, reflecting a similarly low level of attention to adaptationfrom the academic community at the time (Burton et al., 2002). The pro file
was raised in 2001 with the publication of the IPCC Third AssessmentReport, which contained the chapter ‘Adaptation to Climate Change inthe Context of Sustainable Development and Equity’ (Smit et al., 2001).Also in 2001, COP7 adopted a decision (5/CP .7) that outlined a range ofactivities that would promote adaptation in developing countries,including the preparation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action(NAPAs) by least-developed countries. To this end, COP7 establishedthree funds with which adaptation in developing countries could besupported, namely the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), theSpecial Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and the Strategic Priority ‘Pilotingan Operational Approach to Adaptation’ (SPA) under the Trust Fund ofthe Global Environment Facility (GEF). In addition, COP7 took the firststeps toward making operational the Adaptation Fund (Huq, 2002;Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales407Dessai, 2003; Mace, 2005). Section 7.4.2 provides more information on
the international financing of climate change adaptation.
Since 2001, a number of successive decisions have given increasing
priority to climate change adaptation under the UNFCCC. Decision1/CP .10 built on Decision 5/CP .7; it reiterated the need for support foradaptation in developing countries and started a regional consultationprocess. Decision 2/CP .11 then established the Nairobi Work Programme
on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change, which
originally ran from 2006 to 2010 – a next phase is currently under
consideration, to be decided at COP17 in Durban in 2011. The objective
of the Nairobi Work Programme is to assist all Parties, in particular
developing countries, (i) to improve their understanding and assessment
of impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change, and (ii) to
make informed decisions on practical adaptation actions and measuresto respond to climate change on a sound scientific, technical, and
socioeconomic basis, taking into account current and future climate
change and variability (Decision 2/CP .11). The Nairobi Work Programme
is implemented by Parties, intergovernmental and nongovernmental
organizations, the private sector, communities, and other stakeholders.
Several of the nine work areas of the Nairobi Work Programme are
relevant to DRR as well as CCA, in particular ‘climate-related risks andextreme events’ and ‘adaptation planning and practices.’
With Decision 1/CP .13 (also known as the Bali Action Plan), agreed in
December 2007, the COP launched “a comprehensive process to enablethe full, effective, and sustained implementation of the Convention
through long-term cooperative action – now, up to, and beyond 2012 –in order to reach an agreed outcome and adopt a decision at its fifteenthsession” in Copenhagen in December 2009 (COP15). The Bali ActionPlan gave equal priority to mitigation and adaptation, and identifiedtechnology and finance as the key mechanisms for enabling developingcountries to respond to climate change (Clémençon, 2008; Ott et al.,2008; Persson et al., 2009). It recognized the need for action to enhanceadaptation in five main areas:
1)International cooperation to support urgent implementation ofadaptation actions, including through vulnerability assessments,prioritization of actions, financial needs assessments, capacitybuilding, and response strategies, and integration of adaptationactions into sectoral and national planning […]
2)Risk management and risk reduction strategies, including risk-sharing and transfer mechanisms such as insurance
3)Disaster reduction strategies and means to address loss and damageassociated with climate change impacts in developing countriesthat are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climatechange
4)Economic diversification to build resilience
5)Ways to strengthen the catalytic role of the Convention inencouraging multilateral bodies, the public and private sectors, andcivil society, building on synergies among activities and processes,as a means to support adaptation in a coherent and integratedmanner.Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales
Box 7-1 | Commitments on Climate Change Adaptation as Included in the UNFCCC
Article 4.1 : All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional
development priorities, objectives, and circumstances, shall:(b) Formulate, implement, publish, and regularly update national and, where appropriate, regional programs containing measures t o
mitigate climate change by addressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases notcontrolled by the Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change.
(e) Cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change; develop and elaborate appropriate and integrated pla ns
for coastal zone management, water resources, and agriculture, and for the protection and rehabilitation of areas, particularly  in
Africa, affected by drought and desertification, as well as floods.
(f) Take climate change considerations into account, to the extent feasible, in their relevant social, economic, and environment al
policies and actions, and employ appropriate methods, for example impact assessments, formulated and determined nationally,with a view to minimizing adverse effects on the economy, on public health, and on the quality of the environment, of projects or
measures undertaken by them to mitigate or adapt to climate change.
Article 4.4 : The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II shall also assist the developing country
Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adver se effects. 
Article 4.8 : In the implementation of the commitments in this Article, the Parties shall give full consideration to what actions are
necessary under the Convention, including actions related to funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology, to meet the sp ecific
needs and concerns of developing country Parties […].
Article 4.9 : The Parties shall take full account of the specific needs and special situations of the least developed countries in their
actions with regard to funding and transfer of technology.408No agreed outcome was reached at COP15, and no comprehensive
decision was adopted that included these five issues. Instead, the COPdecided to take note of the Copenhagen Accord, a nonbinding documentabout which there was no consensus among Parties, and which providesconsiderably less substance on adaptation than the Bali Action Plan(Bodansky, 2010; Grubb, 2010; Klein, 2010). As mentioned in Section7.4.2, however, the Copenhagen Accord was a milestone toward scaled-up funding for both mitigation and adaptation.
In 2010, Decision 1/CP .16 (part of the Cancun Agreements) established
the Cancun Adaptation Framework (Cozier, 2011). It invites all Parties toenhance action on adaptation by undertaking nine activities related toplanning, implementation, capacity strengthening, and knowledgedevelopment, including “enhancing climate change related disaster riskreduction strategies, taking into consideration the Hyogo Framework forAction where appropriate; early warning systems; risk assessment andmanagement; and sharing and transfer mechanisms such as insurance,at local, national, sub-regional, and regional levels, as appropriat e.” In
addition, Decision 1/CP .16 established (i) a process to enable least-developed countries and other developing countries to formulate andimplement national adaptation plans; (ii) an Adaptation Committee thatwill, among other things, provide technical support, share relevantinformation, promote synergies, and make recommendations on finance,technology, and capacity building required for further action; and (iii) awork program in order to consider approaches to address loss and damageassociated with climate change impacts in developing countries thatare particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.
Decision 1/CP .16 also established a Technology Mechanism, consisting of
a Technology Executive Committee and a Climate Technology Center andNetwork. The Technology Mechanism should accelerate action at differentstages of the technology cycle, including research and development,demonstration, deployment, diffusion, and transfer of technology insupport of mitigation and adaptation. Finally, Decision 1/CP .16 establishedthe Green Climate Fund as a new entity operating the financial mechanismof the UNFCCC under Article 11 (see Section 7.4.2).
The unfolding of international adaptation policy under the UNFCCC shows
the increasing prominence of adaptation in the negotiations, and theincreasing level of detail and concreteness of the relevant COP decisions.It also shows that adaptation under the UNFCCC is increasingly linkedwith disaster risk reduction, with the Hyogo Framework for Action
explicitly mentioned in the Cancun Agreements. Yet, this unfolding, fromDecision 5/CP .7 to Decision 1/CP .16, has taken 10 years.
7.3.3. Current Actors
A wide range of actors play a role in DRM and CCA at the internationallevel. This section does not attempt a comprehensive review of all of
these, but instead identifies the broad areas in which the international
community is providing support at the interface between DRM and
CCA, describes some of the main actors under each of these categories,and summarizes, where available, independent assessments of their
strengths and weaknesses in performing these roles.
7.3.3.1. International Coordination in Linking Disaster Risk
Management and Climate Change Adaptation
Given the wide range of actions and actors that are considered necessary
by those involved to carry out DRM and CCA, and to link them to eachother, effective international coordination is essential. Overall, there areweaknesses in the current systems; the 2009 Global Assessment Report
on Disaster Risk Reduction states that: “Efforts to reduce disaster risk,
reduce poverty and adapt to climate change are poorly coordinated”(UNISDR, 2009a).
The main coordination mechanism for DRR, contributing to DRM, is the
UNISDR, designed to develop a system of partnerships to supportnations and communities to reduce disaster risk. These partners includegovernments, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations,international financial institutions, scientific and technical bodies andspecialized networks as well as civil society and the private sector.Among the diverse range of stakeholders across scales, the nationalgovernments play the most important roles, including developingnational coordination mechanisms; conducting baseline assessments onthe status of disaster risk reduction; publishing and updating summariesof national programs; reviewing national progress toward achieving theobjectives and priorities of the Hyogo Framework; working to implementrelevant international legal instruments; and integrating disaster riskreduction with climate change strategies. Intergovernmental organizationsplay a supporting role, including, for example, promotion of DRR pro grams
and integration into development planning, and capacity building(UNISDR, 2005b). The fact that the primary roles in planning andimplementation are played by national governments, while the UNISDRSecretariat and other intergovernmental organizations provide support ing,
monitoring, and information sharing roles at the regional and globallevel is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.
UNISDR has made specific efforts to link DRR and CCA, through advocacy
of the role of DRR in climate change adaptation, and support for scien tific
reviews of the linkages (including this report). Two evaluations coveringthe effectiveness of UNISDR in linking DRR and CCA have recently beenpublished. The UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General forDisaster Risk Reduction and the main donors to UNISDR requested anindependent evaluation of the performance of the secretariat, whichwas published in 2010 (Dalberg, 2010). This review endorsed the overalleffectiveness of UNISDR, particularly in advocacy and awareness raising,and in establishing global and regional platforms, and specificallyhighlights its strong contribution to mainstreaming DRR into climatechange policy. However, it also highlights difficulties, including lack ofdefinition of comparative advantage within CCA implementation, andthe need to balance the focus and resources spent on DRR in climatechange adaptation versus the broader DRR concept. The same review alsoillustrates challenges in coordination of implementation, particularly theChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales409need for effective coordination with UN Country Teams, the World
Bank, and other relevant partners at the country level, and in the fullimplementation and sustainable follow-up of new initiatives. The UKGovernment also published a review of the performance of the UNISDRSecretariat, alongside other multilateral agencies, in 2011 (DFID, 2011).The review is critical of the overall operational and organizationalstrengths of the UNISDR, citing a lack of a results-based framework, andweaknesses in strategic direction, coordination focus, and speed ofreform. The review does, however, highlight the unique coordinatingrole of UNISDR, and specifically praises “a good focus on climatechange, especially adaptation.”
From the CCA side, the main global mechanism to increase understanding
and share best practice in CCA is the Nairobi Work Programme (NWP),coordinated by the UNFCCC Secretariat (UNFCCC, 2010a; refer toSection 7.3.2.2). The NWP functions mainly as a forum for interestedparties and organizations to specify their own contributions to CCAthrough ‘action pledges,’ and for sharing, synthesis, and disseminationof information. Disaster risk reduction is well represented within theNWP , which identifies DRR as one of its 14 specified adaptation deliveryactivities, with an associated ‘call to action’ for strengthened work inareas such as linking DRR and CCA, risk mapping, and cost-benefitanalysis of adaptation options. Out of the 137 action pledges made bypartners, 59 include a component of DRR. Evaluation of the NWP by Partiesis only now being carried out, so as yet there is no formal assessmentof the degree to which it has supported changes in policy and practiceas well as information exchange. 
7.3.3.2. International Technical and Operational Support
DRM and CCA are now beginning to be linked not only in internationalcoordination activities, but also in mechanisms for international technicaland operational support.
7.3.3.2.1. Climate services for disaster risk reduction and
climate change adaptation
National meteorological and hydrological services (NMHSs) are the
primary source of meteorological observations and forecasts at time
scales relevant to both disaster risk management and climate changeadaptation. These national services also constitute the members of the
WMO, which serves to set international standards and coordinate among
the members, as well as supporting several relevant internationalprograms, including a Disaster Risk Reduction and Service DeliveryBranch and a Climate Prediction and Adaptation Branch.
In recent years, a number of studies have identified weaknesses in the
way in which the large amount of potentially relevant information that
is available from NMHSs at the national and international level isincorporated into development decisions, particularly in the most
vulnerable countries. For example a ‘gap analysis’ of this issue in Africaidentified gaps in (i) integrating climate into policy; (ii) integrating cli mate
into practice; (iii) climate services; and (iv) climate data, concluding that“the problem is one of ‘market’ atrophy: negli gible demand coupledwith inadequate supply of climate services for development decisions”(IRI, 2006). Studies on specific sectors (e.g., health: Kuhn et al., 2005),or at a local level (Vogel and O’Brien, 2006), conclude that the maindeficit is not in generation of data, but in knowledge management. Theyconclude that this requires more effective mechanisms for decisionmakersto identify their information needs, and to work both with providers ofweather and climate information and with institutions working onother dimensions of human and social vulnerability to address theseneeds.
In response to the need for a comprehensive approach to climate
variability and change, and the drive for more demand-driven climateservices the, World Climate Conference-3 agreed in 2009 to begindevelopment of a Global Framework on Climate Services (GFCS) (WMO,2010). This has a goal of “the development and provision of relevantscience-based climate information and prediction for climate riskmanagement and adaptation to climate variability and change,throughout the world.” The framework therefore explicitly links climatevariability (most relevant to DRR), in the context of climate change(most relevant to CCA), and support for risk management decisions(common to both). The GFCS has four major components: a UserInteraction Mechanism; a World Climate Services System; ClimateResearch; and Observation and Monitoring. The initiative will focus onimproving access and operational use of climate information, especiallyin vulnerable, developing countries. The principles and focus of theinitiative therefore correspond closely to the objectives of linking DRMand CCA in operational planning across international and smallerscales. In May 2011, the 16th WMO congress committed to “supportand facilitate the implementation of the GFCS as a priority of theOrganization,” including the development of an implementation planfor review and adoption in 2012 (WMO, 2011).
7.3.3.2.2. Technical and operational support from civil society
Some of the largest international civil society organizations involved indisaster risk management and humanitarian response are now beginningto integrate climate change adaptation activities into their operationalprograms (e.g., CARE International, 2010; Oxfam, 2011). One of thelongest established examples of civil society providing technical supportto CCA and DRM integration is the Red Cross/Red Crescent ClimateCentre. Alongside awareness raising and advocacy, the Centre analyzesforecast information and integrates knowledge of climate risks into RedCross/Red Crescent strategies, plans, and activities, with a particularfocus on implementation at the community level (IFRC, 2011).
The various international civil society organizations working on DRR are
now also beginning to coordinate their operational support, and tomake explicit links to CCA (UNISDR, 2009a). The GNDR was launched in2007, and constitutes over 300 organizations across 90 countries. ItChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales410has three objectives of (1) influencing DRR public policy formulation
(development); (2) increasing public accountability for effective policyadministration (implementation); and (3) raising resources and political
will for community-based DRR (mobilization). One of the five core
strategies of the GNDR is to develop synergies between DRR and climate
change to address underlying risk factors (sustainable development),
including adapting local-level DRR monitoring infrastructure for climate
adaptation, and input to the UNFCCC COP negotiations. Given therecent launch of the initiative there is no evaluation of effectiveness so
far.
7.3.3.3. International Finance Institutions and Donors
7.3.3.3.1. Global Environment Facility
The GEF is an independent financial organization established in 1991
that provides grants to developing countries and countries witheconomies in transition for projects related to biodiversity, climate
change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, andpersistent organic pollutants. It has become the largest funder ofprojects to address global environmental challenges and it serves as thefinancial mechanism for the following conventions:
•Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
•United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC) 
•Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) 
•UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
The GEF administers the main international funds that have been made
available under the UNFCCC for adaptation: the SCCF , which supportsadaptation alongside development, technology transfer, capacitybuilding, and sectoral approaches, and the LDCF , which particularlyfocuses on the development and implementation of NAPAs in the least-developed countries (LDCs). Ten international agencies [UNDP , theUnited Nations Environment Programme, the World Bank, the Food andChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales
Box 7-2 | Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation
in the Context of International Development
Vulnerability to extreme weather and to climate change is strongly conditioned by socioeconomic development, including income l evels
and distribution, supportive institutional frameworks, and the capacities of specific sectors. Conversely, the effects of clima te change,
including through any increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, can also set back economic development (Stern, 2007) .
Countries that are relatively poor, isolated, and reliant on a narrow range of economic activities are particularly vulnerable to such
shocks (UNISDR, 2009a). The objectives of climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable development are t herefore
intricately linked, and while the HFA and UNFCCC are the main international frameworks for CCA and DRR, a wider range of othergovernance and institutional mechanisms have a major influence. These range, for example, from the agreements of the World Trad e
Organization (affecting development and potentially technology transfer for adaptation; WTO, 2011), to the International HealthRegulations (affecting the way that epidemics of climate-sensitive infectious diseases such as cholera are managed across borde rs; WHO,
2007), to the codes of practice of international humanitarian organizations (such as the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross
and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief; ICRC, 1995).
While approaches such as poverty reduction strategies are important in development planning at the national level, arguably the  central
framework for defining global development objectives is the Millennium Declaration and the associated MDGs. These have been agr eed
by all members of the United Nations as well as 23 international organizations, with a target date of 2015 (UN, 2011). These ar e also
supported by international aid agreements, such as the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative to cancel US$ 40 to 55 million dolla rs’ worth of
debt (IMF , 2011), and the commitment of economically advanced countries to commit 0.7% of gross national income to overseasdevelopment aid (UN ,1970). The eight MDGs break down into 21 quantifiable targets that are measured by 60 indicators (UN, 2011 ).
Neither DRM nor CCA are explicitly covered in the MDGs. However, they are strongly linked in practice. First, if disasters occu r they can
set back progress across many of the goals. Second, progress toward the MDGs can help to increase resilience to extreme weatherevents, and to climate change (Schipper and Pelling, 2006). Linking CCA and DRM with the MDGs is therefore important for the co herence
of international development, and the target date of the Hyogo Framework for Action coincides with the intended completion of t he
MDGs (UNISDR, 2005b).
While there are exceptions, the majority of the LDCs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are currently off track to reach most  of the MDGs
(UN, 2011). This has been attributed in part to financial, structural, and institutional weaknesses in the affected countries, and also by
failure of most developed countries to reach the 0.7% aid target. Failure or delays in reaching the MDGs are therefore likely t o be both a
cause and a consequence of vulnerability to extreme weather and climate change (UNISDR, 2005b).411Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Inter-American Development Bank
(IADB), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, theInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the European Bank forReconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the African and AsianDevelopment Banks] implement GEF projects, usually in partnershipwith national or other international agencies. Following a review of theimplementation of the LDCF Fund by the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body forImplementation, parties to the UNFCCC have requested the GEF , inter
alia, to speed up the implementation process, update NAPAs, and work
with its implementing agencies to improve communication with LDCs(UNFCCC, 2011). The GEF also provides interim secretariat services tothe Adaptation Fund, established under the Kyoto Protocol of theUNFCCC, funded mainly through a percentage of the proceeds of theCertified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism(Adaptation Fund, 2011a). The Fund finances climate change adaptationprojects, including DRR projects, in developing countries (AdaptationFund, 2011b).
7.3.3.3.2. The World Bank and Regional Development Banks
The major development banks (the African Development Bank, AsianDevelopment Bank, EBRD, IADB, and World Bank Group) manage muchof the funding for both climate change and disaster reduction. Thisincludes, for example, the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, coveringa wide remit, including integration of climate risk and resilience intodevelopment planning (World Bank, 2009; Climate Funds Update,2011).
Perhaps the clearest example of the strengths and challenges of
international financing for DRM and CCA is provided by the GlobalFacility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), managed by theWorld Bank. This is a partnership of the UNISDR system to support theimplementation of the HFA. The GFDRR’s mission is to mainstreamdisaster reduction and climate change adaptation into national policies,plans, and strategies to promote development and achieve the MDGs.The World Bank provides operational services to the GFDRR, on behalfof donors and other partnering stakeholders. The GFDRR supportsinternational collaboration, and provides technical and financialassistance to low- and middle-income countries that are considered to
be at high risk from disasters (GFDRR, 2010).
Two independent evaluations of the GFDRR have been conducted
(Universalia Management Group, 2010; DFID, 2011). The facility hasmobilized significant funds (over US$ 240 million in contributions and
pledges from 2006 to 2009). The fund is considered relevant andresponsive to stakeholders, and to play a unique role in helping to
bridge knowledge, policy, and practice in DRR services, with goodcoverage of climate change adaptation (Universalia ManagementGroup, 2010). It is also considered to be cost-effective in program
implementation (DFID, 2011). However, the resources that have been
mobilized through the fund remain much lower than those required,
and partnerships, policy integration, and monitoring of results areconsidered uneven across countries. Despite these challenges, thefacility is considered to have achieved important progress, and to be
implementing the necessary steps to improve function and to scale upimplementation (Universalia Management Group, 2010; DFID, 2011).
7.4. Options, Constraints, and Opportunities
for Disaster Risk Management andClimate Change Adaptation at theInternational Level
7.4.1. International Law
As demonstrated in Section 7.2.5, existing tools and instruments of
international law can assist with disaster risk reduction and managementand in driving adaptation to climate change, recognizing at the sametime that international law is limited in scope and enforceability whenapplied to addressing these challenges. 
7.4.1.1. Limits and Constraints of International Law
Structurally, international law is both facilitated and constrained by theneed for explicit or implicit acceptance by nation states, which createand comprise the system.  It follows that the relevance of negotiatedtreaties depends on state consent, while customary law only exists ifthere is state practice and opinio juris . For instance, in the case of the
Tampere Convention on the Provision of Telecommunication Resourcesfor Disaster Mitigation and Relief Operations noted in Section 7.2.5,only four of the 25 most disaster-prone states have signed up, limitingits relevance to many of the states that would most benefit from itsprovisions (Fisher, 2007). The International Bill of Rights, which at facevalue is highly relevant to disaster risk response and in supporting anobligation to assist with adapting to climate change, does not enjoyuniversal acceptance. Furthermore, because international law is madeby and applicable to states, the many non-state actors relevant todisaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation are not subjectto obligations – though as citizens they may benefit from the duty ofstates. 
Some fields of international law provide tools that seem applicable to
disaster risk management and/or adaptation to climate change, yet areconstrained through inherent limited applicability. Internationalhumanitarian law (IHL) enshrined in the 1949 Geneva Conventionsenjoys wide applicability due to universal adherence (Lavoyer, 2006;Fisher, 2007), but is limited to situations of armed conflict. In contrast,‘International Disaster Response Law’ (IDRL) (see Fisher, 2007), some times
proposed as a peacetime counterpart to IHL, not only lacks the centralregime and universal adhesion of the Geneva Conventions, but furtherexperiences challenges in coordination and monitoring (Fisher, 2007).As a second example, international law has on the one hand beendescribed as “not yet equipped to respond adequately to the diversecauses of climate-induced migration” (Von Doussa et al., 2007; generallyBiermann and Boas, 2010), while on the other hand the literature is inChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales412disagreement as to whether refugee law should provide the instruments
to deal with the challenge of migration related to climate change. Theapplication of international refugee law, as codified in the 1951Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, to those who crossinternational borders due to climate-induced migration is indeedcomplex and limited (UNHCR, 2009). Reopening the Convention toexpand the term ‘refugee,’ it is argued, would risk a renegotiation of theConvention and thus potentially result in lower levels of protection forthe displaced (Kolmannskog and Myrstad, 2009).
7.4.1.2. Opportunities for the Application of International Law
The potential expansion of the concepts, definitions, and proceduresknown to international law can also be seen as future opportunity forinternational law to address the challenges of disaster risk reductionand adaptation to climate change. 
Beyond the current international law obligations to mitigate the effects of
climate change, facilitate disaster response, and mandate internationalfacilitation of adaptation efforts (see Section 7.2.5), the fact thatinternational law is shaped by nation states and evolves with statepractice means that international law may also adapt to future realities.Expanding the interpretation and application of existing internationallaw, and the introduction of new law for disaster response and climatechange adaptation, are both plausible in the future. 
A controversial candidate field for expanded interpretation is international
refugee law. The extant definition of ‘refugee’ per the Refugee Conventionand Protocol is any person who is outside their country of nationalityand who, “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted” is unableor unwilling to return to their country. Some literature proposes theexpansion of ‘persecuted’ to encompass being subject to environmentaldisaster or degradation (Warnock, 2007; Kolmannskog and Myrstad,2009). Comparably, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights prohibits torture and “cruel, inhuman, or degrading
punishment.” Some literature notes the potential expansion of the
meaning ‘inhuman treatment’ to include being left without basic levels
of subsistence due to climate change impacts. A step further proposes anew international agreement to share the “emerging burden of climate-
induced migration flows” and which “upholds the human rights of theindividuals affected” (Von Doussa et al., 2007). The expansion of the
definition of refugee remains highly controversial, with many states
opposing the use of refugee law to address climate-related, transboundary
movement of people.
The emerging legal doctrine of ‘responsibility to protect’ has also been
proposed in application to natural disasters. The emergence of statepractice in observing certain responsibilities “before, during, and after
natural disasters occur” in the absence of obligations to do so supportsan emerging responsibility to protect in the context of natural disaster,and sources of human rights law are to be used in promoting this doc trine
(Saechao, 2007).7.4.2. International Finance
The UNFCCC recognizes that in addition to the need to mitigateemissions of greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change, there is aresponsibility on developed countries to support developing countries inthis process (see Article 4.4 in Box 7-1). A starting point for the delivery
of adaptation finance is the assessment of adaptation finance needs,
which have also been interpreted as a proxy for adaptation costs (seeSection 4.5). The UNFCCC (2007b) estimated the additional investmentand financial flows needed worldwide to be US$ 48 to 171 billion in 2030(or US$ 60 to 193 billion when also considering current investment needsfor ecosystem adaptation). Some US$ 28 to 67 billion of this amountwould be needed in developing countries (UNFCCC, 2007b). The largestuncertainty in these estimates is in the cost of adapting infrastructure,which may require anything between US$ 8 and 130 billion in 2030,one-third of which would be for developing countries. The UNFCCC(2007b) also estimated that an additional amount of about US$ 41 billion would be needed for agriculture, water, health, and coastal zoneprotection, most of which would be used in developing countries. Otherstudies providing estimates of the annual incremental costs of adaptationin developing countries include those by the World Bank (2006), Stern(2007), Oxfam International (2007), Watkins (2007), and the World Bank(2010b). These estimates are shown in Table 7-1, and discussed in moredetail in Parry et al. (2009) and Fankhauser (2010).
While these different estimates highlight the high level of uncertainty,
there appears to be consensus that global adaptation costs will totaltens of billions of US dollars per year in developing countries. A reviewby the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)of the estimates mentioned above found that there is very little quantifiedinformation on the costs of adaptation in developing countries, andmost studies are constrained to a few sectors within countries (mostlycoastal zones and, to a lesser extent, water, agriculture, and health)(Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008). In addition, these studies assumerelatively crude relationships and make strong assumptions, such asperfect foresight and high levels of autonomous adaptation. Almostno cross-sector studies have examined cumulative effects withincountries, and only a handful of studies have investigated the widermacroeconomic consequences of impacts or adaptation. Moreover,most of the literature only considers adaptation to average changes intemperature or sea level rise. Little attention has been paid to moreChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales

magnitude of extreme events (Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008).
According to Agrawala and Fankhauser (2008), the consensus on global
adaptation costs, even in order of magnitude terms, may therefore bepremature. In addition, in most cases the estimates are neither attributedto specific adaptation activities, nor do they articulate the benefits ofadaptation investment. Double counting between sectors and scalingup to global levels from very limited (and often local) source materiallimit utility. At the same time, a point also noted by Parry et al. (2009),many sectors and adaptations have not been included in the estimates.
In addition to these global estimates, total adaptation finance needs can
also be assessed by aggregating national estimates, although this ishampered by the absence of a common method to make such estimates,and the fact that they are not available for all countries. The NAPAs (seeSection 7.3.2 and Chapter 6), which have now been completed by mostLDCs, are the most extensive effort to date to assess adaptation prioritiesand finance needs in developing countries. The cumulative cost ofprojects prioritized to respond to urgent and immediate adaptationneeds is approximately US$ 1,660 million for the 43 countries that hadcompleted their NAPAs by September 2009 (UNFCCC, 2010b). Thedivergence from the global estimates mentioned above can beexplained by several factors: they cover only 43 LDCs, they include onlyprioritized projects, and they consider only urgent and immediateadaptation needs, not medium- to long-term needs (Persson et al., 2009).
A challenge for the international community is how to meet the adaptation
finance needs that have been identified. The GEF operates the LDCF andSCCF , to provide funding to eligible developing countries to meet the‘additional’ or ‘incremental’ costs of adaptation; the baseline costs of aproject or program are borne by the recipient country, by other bilateralor multilateral donors, or both. The LDCF and SCCF rely on voluntarycontributions from developed countries. As of May 2010, US$ 315 millionhad been pledged for adaptation under these two funds (US$ 221 millionto the LDCF and US$ 94 million to the SCCF); of this amount, US$ 220million has been allocated (US$ 135 million from the LDCF and US$ 85million from the SCCF) (GEF , 2010a). In addition, the GEF has allocatedall US$ 50 million it had made available to the SPA (GEF , 2008; see also
Klein and Möhner, 2009).
The Adaptation Fund, which became operational in 2009, is operated by
a special Adaptation Fund Board. It is the first financial instrumentunder the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol that is not based solely on
voluntary contributions from developed countries. It receives a 2%share of proceeds from project activities under the Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM), but can also receive funds from other sources to
fund concrete adaptation projects and programs (Persson et al., 2009).
The actual amount of money that will be available from the Adaptation
Fund depends on the extent to which the CDM is used and on theprice of carbon. As of October 2010, the Adaptation Fund had receivedUS$ 202.09 million, of which US$ 130.55 million was generated throughCDM activities. Estimates of potential resources available for theAdaptation Fund from 31 October 2010 to 31 December 2012 range
from US$ 288.4 million to US$ 401.5 million (Adaptation Fund, 2010).
While the GEF-managed funds have supported adaptation activities in
some 80 countries (Persson et al., 2009), there has been criticism,particularly from developing countries, on how the funds are beingmanaged (e.g., Mitchell et al., 2008; Klein and Möhner, 2009; Ministryof Foreign Affairs of Denmark and GEF Evaluation Office, 2009). Inaddition, concern has been voiced about the predictability and adequacyof funds, and the perceived equity and fairness of decisionmaking (Mace,2005; Paavola and Adger, 2006; Müller, 2007; Persson et al., 2009). TheGEF has acknowledged the criticism and indicated in reports to theCOP how it is responding to it (GEF , 2009, 2010b). At the same time,developed countries have raised concern about fiduciary risks in somedeveloping countries, which would need to be addressed throughimproved accountability and transparency before program-basedadaptation can be supported by international finance (Mitchell et al.,2008; GEF , 2010b). The Adaptation Fund has not been operational longenough to allow for such an assessment but the first signals are positive,particularly regarding its governance structure and the option of directaccess (Czarnecki and Guilanpour, 2009; Brown et al., 2010; Grasso,2010).
In addition to the funds operating within the context of the UNFCCC,
money for adaptation is provided through several other channels,including developing countries’ domestic national, sectoral, and localbudgets; bilateral and multilateral development assistance; and private-sector investments. This makes for an adaptation financing landscapethat is highly fragmented, resulting in a proliferation not only of funds butalso of policies, rules, and procedures (Persson et al., 2009). But despitethe proliferation of funds, the amount of money currently available fallssubstantially short of the adaptation finance needs presented above.
In light of this shortfall, the 2009 Copenhagen Accord was a milestone
in international climate finance. It refers to a collective commitment fordeveloped countries to provide “new and additional resources …approaching USD 30 billion” in ‘fast start’ money for the 2010-2012period, balanced between adaptation and mitigation, and sets a longer-term collective goal of mobilizing US$ 100 billion per year by 2020 fromall sources (public and private, bilateral and multilateral) (Bodansky,2010). Although the Copenhagen Accord was not adopted by the COP ,the collective commitment and longer-term goal are also part of theCancun Agreements, which the COP adopted a year later. Parties agreedthat “scaled-up, new and additional, predictable and adequate fundingshall be provided to developing country Parties, taking into account theurgent and immediate needs of developing countries that are particularlyvulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.” In the meantime,the High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing, establishedby the UN Secretary-General, had analyzed the feasibility of mobilizingUS$ 100 billion per year by 2020. It concluded that “it is challenging butfeasible to meet that goal. Funding will need to come from a widevariety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, includingalternative sources of finance, the scaling up of existing sources, and
Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales414increased private flows. Grants and highly concessional loans are crucial
for adaptation in the most vulnerable developing countries, such as theleast developed countries, small island developing States and Africa”(AGF , 2010).
An open question is how climate finance might be linked with other
international finance flows. The Bali Action Plan referred to “means toincentivize the implementation of adaptation actions on the basis ofsustainable development policies” in its section on the provision offinancial resources. The Copenhagen Accord did not discuss the linkbetween adaptation and development, even though the issue of‘mainstreaming’ – integrating adaptation to climate change intomainstream development planning and decisionmaking – was muchdebated in the pre-Copenhagen negotiations on adaptation finance(Persson et al., 2009; Klein, 2010). From an operational perspective,mainstreaming adaptation into development makes common sense:both contribute to enhancing human security, and opportunities tocreate synergies between the two are increasingly recognized andpursued (Gigli and Agrawala, 2007; Klein et al., 2007; Kok et al., 2008;Gupta and Van de Grijp, 2010). Besides, there is a range of activitiesthat can be seen as contributing to both adaptation and developmentobjectives (McGray et al., 2007).
But from a climate policy perspective, mainstreaming creates a dilemma
(Persson and Klein, 2009; Klein, 2010). Financial flows for adaptationand those for development – for example, official development assistance(ODA) – are managed separately. One of the arguments in favor ofmainstreamed adaptation is that it makes more efficient use of financialand human resources than adaptation that is designed, implemented,and managed as stand-alone activities (i.e., separately from ongoingdevelopment planning and decisionmaking). However, developingcountries have expressed the concern that, as a result of donors seekingto create synergies between adaptation and development, finance foradaptation will not be new and additional but in effect will be absorbedinto ODA budgets of a fixed size (Michaelowa and Michaelowa, 2007).The concern is fueled by the fact that the amount of money currentlyavailable for adaptation falls short of the estimated adaptation financeneeds in developing countries. A second, related concern is that
mainstreaming could divert any new and additional funds for adaptation
into more general development activities, thus limiting the opportunity
to evaluate, at least quantitatively, their benefits with respect to climate
change specifically (Yamin, 2005). Third, there is concern that donors’ useof ODA to pursue mainstreamed adaptation could impose conditionalities
on what should be a country-driven process (Gupta et al., 2010).
As mentioned in Section 7.3.2, the Cancun Agreements established the
Green Climate Fund as a new entity operating the financial mechanismunder Article 11. The Green Climate Fund is not yet operational and it istoo early to say how it might address the mainstreaming dilemma, or
even how important it will be for climate adaptation in developing
countries. All that can be said at this moment is that in the Cancun
Agreements, Parties decided that “a significant share of new multilateralfunding for adaptation should flow through the Green Climate Fund.”7.4.3. Technology Transfer and Cooperation
7.4.3.1. Technology and Climate Change Adaptation
Technologies receive prominent attention both in adaptation to emerging
and future impacts of climate change as well as in mitigating currentdisasters. The sustainability, operation, and maintenance of technologiescan be challenging in many developing countries due to lack of
resources, human capacity, and cultural differences. Moreover, technologytransfer is complex and requires capacity building as well as a client
(technology user) focus as opposed to a developer (technology designer)focus (O’Brien et al., 2007). Intellectual property rights are rarely anissue in the availability and use of technologies for adaptation (Murphy,2011) but when they are, adequate methods are needed that fosteraffordable deployment of new technologies but preserve the incentivesfor technology developers (Doig, 2008). While the importance oftransferring technologies from developers/owners to would-be users iswidely recognized, the bulk of the literature seems to address the issuesat a rather generic level, without going into the details of whattechnologies for adaptation would need to be transferred in differentimpact sectors from where to where and via what mechanisms.Institutional, political, technological, economic, information, financial,cultural, legal, and participation and consultation obstacles can hinderthe transfer of mitigation and adaptation technologies and concertedefforts are required to overcome those impediments (IEA, 2001). Private-public partnership as a policy instrument could well be a mechanismfor transferring the required technologies for adaptation projects(Agrawala and Fankhauser, 2008). In the adaptation literature,publications addressing the transfer of technologies important forreducing vulnerability and increasing the ability to cope with weather-related disasters are even scarcer. This section reviews literature ontechnologies for adaptation and the issues involved in internationaltechnology transfer of such technologies.
The Special Report on Methodological and Technological Issues in
Technology Transfer by the IPCC defines the term ‘technology transfer’
as a “broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experienceand equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change amongstdifferent stakeholders such as governments, private sector entities,financial institutions, NGOs and research/education institutions” (IPCC,2000, p. 3). The report uses a broad and inclusive term ‘transfer’encompassing diffusion of technologies and technology cooperationacross and within countries. It evaluates international as well as domestictechnology transfer processes, barriers, and policies. This section focuseson the international aspects.
Adaptation to climate change involves more than merely the application
of a particular technology (Klein et al., 2005). Adaptation measuresinclude increasing robustness of infrastructural designs and long-terminvestments, increasing flexibility of vulnerable managed systems,enhancing adaptability of natural systems, reversing trends that increasevulnerability, and improving societal risk awareness and preparedness.In the case of disasters related to extreme weather events, anticipatoryChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales415adaptation is more effective and less costly than emergency measures
and retrofitting, and immediate benefits can be gained from betteradaptation to climate variability and extreme events. Some factors thatdetermine adaptive capacity of human systems are the level of economicwealth, access to technology, information, knowledge and skills, andexistence of institutions, infrastructure, and social capital (Smit et al.,2001; Christoplos et al., 2009).
An extensive list of ‘soft’ options that are vital to building capacity to
cope with climatic hazards with references to publications that eitherdescribe the technology in detail or provide examples of its applicationis available (Klein et al., 2000, 2005). For example, the applications incoastal system adaptation include various types of geospatial informa tion
technologies such as mapping and surveying, videography, airbornelaser scanning (lidar), satellite and airborne remote sensing, globalpositioning systems in addition to tide gauges and historical andgeological methods. These technologies help formulate adaptationstrategies (protection versus retreat), implement the selected strategy
(design, construction, and operation), and provide early warning(UNFCCC, 2006a). Another set of examples includes technologies to
protect against sea level rise: dikes, levees, floodwalls, seawalls,revetments, bulkheads, groynes, detached breakwaters, floodgates, tidalbarriers, and saltwater intrusion barriers among the hard structuraloptions, and periodic beach nourishment,  dune restoration and creation,
and wetland restoration and creation as examples of soft structural
options (Klein et al., 2000, 2005). A combination of these technologies
selected on the basis of local conditions constitutes the protection
against extreme events in coastal regions. Structural measures arelocalized solutions and there is a need for localized information such as
their environmental and hydrologic impacts. In addition, there are a
series of indigenous options (flood and drought management) that
might be valuable in regions to be affected by similar events (Klein et
al., 2005, p. 19). It is also important to integrate technology transferefforts for CCA and DRR needs with sustainable development efforts to
avoid conflicts and foster synergies between them (Hope Sr., 1996; Sanusi,2005). Adaptation is normally assumed to be benign for developmentbut Eriksen and Brown (2011) challenge this assumption, arguing thatthere is emerging evidence that adaptation measures run counter toprinciples of sustainable development, as both social equality andenvironmental integrity can be threatened. Placing responses to extremeevents into the larger context of other societal and environmentalchanges will be vital for sustainable development (Yohe et al., 2007;Eriksen et al., 2011).
A report by the UNFCCC (2006a) summarizes the technology needs
identified by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention.Curiously, only one country mentioned ‘potential for adaptation’ amongthe commonly used criteria for prioritizing technology needs. Among30 technologies listed in the report, the technology needs relevant forcoping and adapting to weather extremes include, for example,improved drainage, emergency planning, raising buildings and land, andprotecting against sea level rise. Many of these are good examples ofmeasures that link DRR and CCA objectives, namely to reduce overallecological and social vulnerability. Another UNFCCC report (2006b)observes that, unlike those for mitigation, the forms of technology foradaptation are often rather familiar. Many have been used overgenerations in coping with floods, for example, by building houses onstilts or by cultivating floating vegetable plots. Some other types oftechnologies draw on new developments in, for example, advancedmaterials science and satellite remote sensing (see Box 7-3). TheUNFCCC report (2006b) provides an overview of the old and newtechnologies available in adapting to changing environments, includingclimate change. The Disaster Reduction Hyperbase in Asia is a web-based collection of new and traditional indigenous technologiesrelevant to DRM that also promotes communication among developingand industrial countries (Kameda, 2007).Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales
Box 7-3 | Examples of Technologies for Adaptation in Asia
In Asia, adaptation to climate change, variability, and extreme events at the community level are small scale and concentrate m ainly on
agriculture, water, and disaster amelioration (Alam et al., 2007). They focus on the livelihood of affected communities, raise awareness to
change practices, diversify agriculture, and promote water conservation. For example, Saudi Arabia has already built 215 dams f or water
storage and 30 desalination plants, passed water protection and conservation laws, and initiated leakage detection and control schemes
as well as advanced irrigation water conservation schemes and a system for modified water pumping as part of its climate changeadaptation program (Alam et al., 2007). In India, a combination of traditional and innovative technological approaches is used to manage
drought risk. Technological management of drought (e.g., development and use of drought tolerant cultivars, shifting cropping s easons
in agriculture, flood and drought control techniques in water management) is combined with model-based seasonal and annual todecadal forecasts. Model results are translated into early warning in order to take appropriate drought protection measures (Al am et al.,
2007). In China, adaptation technologies have been widely used for flood disaster mitigation (Alam et al., 2007). Another examp le is
related to the Philippines where a typhoon in 1987 completely destroyed over 200,000 homes. The Department of Social Welfare an d
Development initiated a program of providing typhoon-resistant housing for the population in the most typhoon-prone areas (Diac on,
1992). The so-called Core Shelter houses have typhoon resistant features and can endure wind speeds up to 180 km hr
-1. The technology
was proved to be successful by providing the required protection and was adopted recently in regions stricken by a landslide(Government of the Philippines, 2008) and typhoons (Government of the Philippines, 2010), partly financed by UNDP .4167.4.3.2. Technologies for Extreme Events
Approaching the issues of technologies to foster adaptation to extreme
weather events and their impacts from the direction of disaster mitiga tion,
Sahu (2009) presents an overview of diverse technologies that might beapplied in various stages of disaster management.  The list of technolo gies
for adaptation to weather-related extreme events includes early warning
and disaster preparedness; search and rescue for disaster survivors;water supply, purification, and treatment; food supply, storage, and safety;energy and electricity supply; medicine and healthcare for disaster vic tims;
disease surveillance; sanitation and waste management; and disaster-resistant housing and construction (Sahu, 2009).
Developing wind-resistant building technologies is crucial for reducing
vulnerability to high-wind conditions like storms, hurricanes, andtornadoes. A report by the International Hurricane Research Centrepresents hurricane loss reduction devices and techniques (IHRC, 2006).The Wall of Wind testing apparatus (multi-fan systems that generate upto 209 km hr
-1winds and include water-injection and debris-propulsion
systems with sufficient wind field sizes to test the construction of smallsingle-story buildings) will improve the understanding of the failuremode of buildings and hence lead to technologies and products tomitigate hurricane impacts (Fugate and Crist, 2008).
An absolutely crucial aspect of managing weather extremes both under
the present and future climate regime is the ability to forecast andprovide early warning. Downscaling projections from global climatemodels could provide useful information about the changing risks. It isimportant to note that really useful early warning systems would providemulti-hazard warning and warnings on vulnerability development to theextent it is possible. Satellite and aerial monitoring, meteorologicalmodels, and computer tools including geographic information systems(GIS) as well as local and regional communication systems are the mostessential technical components. (The focus on technology here does notnegate the importance of social and communication aspects of earlywarning.) The use of GIS in the support of emergency operations in thecase of both weather and non-weather disasters is becoming increas ingly
important in the United States. The benefits of using GIS technologies
include informing the public, enabling officials to make smarter decisions,and facilitating first-responder efforts to effectively locate and rescue
storm victims (NASCIO, 2006). Lack of locally useable climate change
information about projected changes in extreme weather eventsremains an important constraint in managing weather-related disasters,
especially in developing countries. Therefore there is a need to develop
regional mechanisms to support in developing and delivering downscalingtechniques and tools (see Section 3.2.3 for details on downscalingregional climate models) and transferring them to developing countries.
Space technologies (such as Earth observation, satellite imagery, real-time
application of space sensors, mapping) are important in the reduction ofdisasters, including extreme weather and climate events such as drought,
flood, and storms (Rukieh and Koudmani, 2006). These technologies can
be particularly helpful in the risk assessment, mitigation, and prepared nessphases of disaster management by identifying risk-prone areas,
establishing zoning restrictions and escape routes, etc. Space technologiesare important for early warning and in managing the effects of disasters.For incorporating the routine use of space technology-based solutionsin developing countries, there is a need to increase awareness, buildnational capacity, and also develop solutions that are customized andappropriate to their needs (Rukieh and Koudmani, 2006). A good exampleof the application of space technology at international scales and forearly warning is the joint initiative of WMO, the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, the US Agency for International Development,and the Hydrologic Research Center on global flash flood guidance. Thesystem uses global data produced by a global center and downscales theglobal information to regional products that are sent to national entitiesfor further downscaling at the national level and then disseminated tousers and communities (WMO, 2007, 2010). It is also important to notethat there are existing capabilities within some particularly exposeddeveloping countries (such as India, Bangladesh, China, Philippines)with well-developed remote-sensing capabilities of their own, or existingarrangements with other space agency suppliers.
Support for risk reduction and relief agencies and governments depends,
among other factors, on timely availability of information about the scaleand nature of these disasters (Holdaway,  2001). Currently,  ground-based
sources provide most of such information. This could be improved byusing input from space-based sensor systems, both for disasterwarning and disaster monitoring where the scale of devastation cannotadequately be monitored from ground-based information sources alone.A global space-based monitoring and information system, with theassociated ability to provide advanced warning of many types of hazards,can be combined with the latest developments in sensor technology(optical, infrared, radar) including a UK initiative on high-resolutionimaging from a microsatellite (Holdaway, 2001). The literature suggeststhat transferring these technologies and the related know-how will beimportant for building capacities in CCA and DRR in countries wherethey are still missing ( medium certainty, limited evidence ).
Microsatellites (low weights and small sizes, just under or well below
500 kg) are seen as an important technology for the detection of andpreparation for weather-related hazards in other countries as well.Shimizu (2008) emphasizes the importance of international cooperationin this area. He observes that only a few countries are able to developlarge rockets and satellites and launch them from their own territories.Several Asian countries have been cooperating with OECD countries todevelop small Earth observation satellites, like DAICHI (Advanced LandObserving Satellite) and WINDS (Wideband Internetworking engineeringtest and demonstration satellite) that include both optical and microwavesensors. DAICHI operated between 2006 and 2011 based on cooperationof Asian countries with the United States and the European Union andmade an important contribution to emergency observations of regionshit by major disasters in this period (JAXA, 2011).
Mitigation of adverse cyclone impacts involves reliable tropical cyclone
forecasting and warnings, and efficient ways to convey the informationChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales417to stakeholders, users, and the general public (Lee et al., 2006). It is
important that NMHSs take advantage of the advances in communica tion
technology such as wireless broadband access, Global Positioning System(GPS), and GIS to enhance the relevance and effectiveness of warnings,options, and backup capabilities to disseminate warnings throughmultiple and diverse channels (Lee et al., 2006). Natural hazardsmanagement has advanced to address a major challenge: turning real-time data provided by new technologies (e.g., satellite- and ground-basedsensors and instruments) into information products to help people makebetter decisions about their own safety and prosperity (Groat, 2004).
The literature about technology transfer to foster adaptation to changes
in extreme events induced by climate change is very limited. It wasnecessary to broaden the scope of the literature review and embraceclimate change adaptation in general in order to gain lessons about theprocesses, channels, stakeholders, and barriers of technology transfer. Inaddition, useful insights were inferred from the literature on technologytransfer to support climate change mitigation, disaster risk reduction(prevention, mitigation, and preparedness), and other related areas. TheDRR literature on technology development and transfer documents theexpanding international cooperation in forecasting and monitoringextreme weather events by collecting and disseminating satellite-basedinformation and the international transfer of know-how to interpret it.There is increasing emphasis on the importance of establishing closelinkages across all EWS components ranging from collection of hydro-meteorological data, forecasting how nature will respond (e.g., weatheror flood forecasting), to communicating information (or warnings) todecisionmakers (sectoral users or communities) ( medium agreement,
limited evidence ).
7.4.3.3. Financing Technology Transfer
Climate change mitigation has been the primary focus of the financing
mechanisms and innovative financing in recent years. In contrast, thetransfer of technologies for adaptation is hampered by insufficientincentive regimes, increased risks, and high transaction costs (Klein etal., 2005). Yet the lessons from the transfer of mitigation technologies
are relevant for adaptation: results of the penetration of energy andindustrial technologies in the developing countries depend on many
factors ranging from labor skills, market conditions, achieved level of
technological development, the reliability of basic services (electricity
and water), availability of spare parts, etc. A combination of interrelatedsocioeconomic, institutional, and governance issues would often
determine the success or failure of technology transfer, rather than the
technologies themselves (Klein et al., 2005, p. 23). These factors are also
important in transferring technologies for adaptation because they
determine the feasibility and efficiency of adopting the transferred
technologies (e.g., regulations to build and install them, skilled labor,
water and electricity to operate them).
UNFCCC (2005) addresses the transfer of environmentally sound
technologies for adaptation to climate change: the needs for and theidentification and evaluation of technologies for adaptation to climate
change, and financing their transfer. Cost is one of the main barriers intechnology transfer; therefore innovative financing for the developmentand transfer of technologies is needed. Potential sources of funding fortechnology transfer include bilateral activities of Parties, multilateralactivities such as the GEF , the World Bank, or regional banks, the SCCF ,the LDCF , financial flows generated by Joint Implementation and CDMprojects, and the private sector (see also Section 7.3.3.3). The GEF fundsfor adaptation activities include the SPA trust fund, the LDCF , and theSCCF . In addition, the GEF is providing secretariat services to theAdaptation Fund Board under the Kyoto Protocol (see also Section7.4.2).
Climate variability is already a major impediment to development and
2% of World Bank funds are devoted to disaster reconstruction andrecovery (World Bank, 2008). In order to use available funds efficiently,the World Bank (2009) developed the screening tool ADAPT(Assessment & Design for Adaptation to Climate Change: A PrototypeTool), a software-based tool for assessing development projects forpotential sensitivities to climate change. The tool combines climatedatabases and expert assessments of the threats and opportunities arisingfrom climate variability and change. As of 2011, the knowledge areascovered by the tool cover agriculture and irrigation in India and sub-Saharan Africa and, for all regions, various aspects of biodiversity andnatural resources.
Both conventional and innovative options for financing the transfer of
technologies for adaptation might be explored. As conventional options,the GEF funds (SPA, LDCF , and SCCF) provide opportunities for accessingfinancial resources that could be used for deployment, diffusion, andtransfer of technologies for adaptation, including initiatives on capacitybuilding, partnerships, and information sharing. Projects identified intechnology needs assessments could also be implemented using thesefinancial opportunities. Based on these experiences as well as onspecial needs of groups of countries such as small island developingstates and LDCs, further guidance could be provided to the GEF onfunding technologies for adaptation. In addition, there is an opportunityto explore innovative financing mechanisms that can promote, facilitate,and support increased investment in technologies for adaptation(UNFCCC, 2005).
Concerning financing of technological development and transfer, a
report by the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (UNFCCC, 2009a)classifies technologies by stage of maturity, the source of financing(public or private sector), and whether they are under or outside theUNFCCC and estimates the financing resources currently available fortechnology research, development, deployment, diffusion, and transfer.The estimates for financing mitigation technologies are between US$ 70and 165 billion per year. In the adaptation area, the report claims thatresearch and development is focused on tailoring technologies to specificsites and applications and thus the related expenditures become part ofthe project costs. Current spending on adaptation projects in developingcountries is about US$ 1 billion per year (UNFCCC, 2009a).Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales418The literature clearly shows that the transfer of technologies for
adaptation lags behind the transfer of mitigation technologies in termsof the scales of attention and funding. Funding transfer and fundingmechanisms for technologies that help reduce vulnerability to climatevariability, particularly to weather-related extreme events, appear to beas important for both CCA and DRR ( high confidence ). 
7.4.4. Risk Sharing and Transfer
This section examines the current and potential role of the international
community – international financial institutions, NGOs, developmentorganizations, private market actors, and the emerging adaptationcommunity – in enabling access to insurance and other financial
instruments that share and transfer risks of extreme weather. The
international transfer and sharing of risk is an opportunity for individualsand governments of all countries that cannot sufficiently diversify theirportfolio of weather risk internally, and especially (as discussed inSection 6.3.3) for governments of vulnerable countries that do not wishto rely on ad hoc and often insufficient post-disaster assistance.
Experience shows that the international community can play a role in
enabling individual, national, and international risk-sharing and transferstrategies ( high confidence ). The following discussion identifies successful
practices, or value added, as well as constraints on this role.
7.4.4.1. International Risk Sharing and Transfer
Risk transfer (usually with payment) and risk sharing (usually informalwith no payment) are recognized by the international community as anintegral part of DRM and CCA (see Case Study 9.2.13 for definitions).The 2005 HFA calls on the disaster community “to promote thedevelopment of financial risk-sharing mechanisms, particularly insuranceand reinsurance against disasters” (UNISDR, 2005a, p. 11). Similarly, the2007 Bali Action Plan calls for consideration of risk-sharing and transfermechanisms as a means for enhancing adaptation (UNFCCC, 2007a).The Plan builds on the mandate to consider insurance as set out by
Article 4.8 of the UNFCCC and Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol. 
Often by necessity risk sharing and transfer are international. Local and
national pooling arrangements (discussed in Sections 5.5.2 and 6.3.3)may not be viable for statistically dependent (co-variant) risks that cannotbe sufficiently diversified. A single event can cause simultaneous lossesto many insured assets, violating the underlying insurance principle ofdiversification. For this reason, primary insurers, individuals, andgovernments (particularly in small countries) rely on risk-sharing andtransfer instruments that diversify their risks regionally and even glob ally.
A few examples can serve to illustrate international arrangements:
•A government receives international emergency assistance and
loans after a major disaster.
•A family locates a relative in a distant country who provides post-disaster relief through remittances.•After a major disaster, a farm household takes out a loan from aninternationally backed micro-lending institution.
•An insurer purchases reinsurance from a private reinsurancecompany, which spreads these risks to its international shareholders.
•A government issues a catastrophe bond, which transfers risksdirectly to the international capital markets.
•Many small countries form a catastrophe insurance pool, which
diversifies risks and better enables them to purchase reinsurance.
Not only are these financial arrangements international in character, but
many are supported by the international development and climateadaptation communities (see, especially, UNISDR, 2005b; UNFCCC,2009b). At the outset it is important to point out that these instrumentscannot stand alone but must be viewed as part of a risk managementstrategy, for which cost-effective risk reduction is a priority.
7.4.4.2. International Risk-Sharing and Transfer Mechanisms
This section reviews international mechanisms for sharing and transfer ring
risk, including remittances, post-disaster credit, insurance and reinsur ance,
alternative insurance mechanisms, and regional pooling arrangements.
7.4.4.2.1. Remittances
Remittances – transfers of money from foreign workers or expatriatecommunities to their home countries – make up a large part of informalrisk sharing and transfer, even exceeding official development aid flows.In 2010, the official worldwide flow of remittances was estimated atUS$ 325 billion, and unrecorded flows may add another 50% or more.In some cases, remittances can be as large as one-third of the recipientcountry’s gross domestic product (World Bank, 2011b).
A number of studies show that remittances increase substantially
following disasters, often exceeding post-disaster donor assistance(Lucas and Stark, 1985; Miller and Paulson, 2007; Yang and Choi, 2007;Mohapatra et al., 2009). Payments can be sent through professionalmoney transfer organizations, but often these channels break down andremittances are carried by hand (Savage and Harvey, 2007). While simplein concept, remittances can be complicated by associated transfer fees.A survey carried out in the United Kingdom found that for an average-sized transfer, the associated costs could vary between 2.5 and 40%(DFID, 2005). Information pertinent to the transfer is often obscure or inan unfamiliar language, and transfers across some borders have beencomplicated due to initiatives taken by developed nations to counterinternational money laundering and terrorism financing (Fagen andBump, 2006). Finally, a major problem is difficulties in communicatingwith relatives abroad, as well as the high potential of losing necessarydocuments in a disaster.
The international community has been active in reducing the costs and
barriers to post-disaster remittances. DFID, among other developmentChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales419organizations, supports financial inclusion policies including mobile
banking and special savings accounts earmarked for disaster recoverythat will greatly reduce transaction costs. High-tech proposals for assuringsecurity have included biometric identification cards and retina scannersas forms of identification (DFID, 2005; Pickens et al., 2009).
7.4.4.2.2. Post-disaster credit
One of the most important post-disaster financing mechanisms, creditprovides governments and individuals with resources after a disaster, yetwith an obligation to repay at a later time. Governments and individualsof highly vulnerable countries, however, can have difficulties borrowingfrom commercial lenders in the post-disaster context. Since the early1980s, the World Bank has thus initiated over 500 loans for recovery andreconstruction with a total disbursement of more than US$ 40 billion(World Bank, 2006), and the Asian Development Bank also reports largeloans for this purpose (Arriens and Benson, 1999). With the growingimportance of pre-disaster planning, a recent innovation on the part ofinternational organizations is to make pre-disaster contingent loanarrangements – for example, the World Bank’s catastrophe deferreddrawdown option, which disburses quickly after the governmentdeclares an emergency (World Bank, 2008).
For micro-finance institutions (MFIs), post-disaster lending has associated
risks given increased demand that tempts relaxed loan conditions oreven debt pardoning. This risk is particularly acute in vulnerable regions.Recognizing the need for a risk transfer instrument to help MFIs remainsolvent in the post-disaster period, the Swiss State Secretariat forEconomic Affairs (SECO) and the IADB, as well as private investors,created the Emergency Liquidity Facility (ELF) (UNFCCC, 2008). Locatedin Costa Rica, ELF provides needed and immediate post-disaster liquidityat low rates to MFIs across the region.
7.4.4.2.3. Insurance and reinsurance
Insurance is an instrument for distributing disaster losses among a pool
of at-risk households, farms, businesses, and/or governments, and is the
most recognized form of international risk transfer. The insured share of
property losses from extreme weather events has risen from a negligiblelevel in the 1950s to approximately 20% of the total in 2007 (Mills,
2007).
Insurance and reinsurance markets attract capital from international
investors, making insurance an instrument for transferring disaster risks
over the globe. The market is highly international in character, yet
uneven in its cover. In the period 2000 to 2005, for example, US insurers
purchased reinsurance annually from more than 2,000 different non-US
reinsurers (Cummins and Mahul, 2009, p. 115). From 1980 through 2003,insurance covered 4% of total losses from climate-related disasters
(estimated at about US$ 1 trillion) in developing countries compared to
40% in high-income countries (Munich Re, 2003).The international community is playing an active role in enabling
insurance in developing countries, particularly by supporting micro- andsovereign (macro) insurance initiatives. The following four examplesillustrate this role:
•The World Bank and World Food Programme provided essentialtechnical assistance and support for establishing the Malawi pilot
micro-insurance program (see discussion in Section 5.5.2), whichprovides index-based drought insurance to smallholder farmers
(Hess and Syroka, 2005; Suarez et al., 2007).
•The Mongolian government and World Bank support theMongolian Index-Based Livestock Insurance Program (see Section5.5.2) by absorbing the losses from very infrequent extreme events(over 30% animal mortality) and providing a contingent debtarrangement to back this commitment, respectively (Skees andEnkh-Amgalan, 2002; Skees et al., 2008).
•The World Food Programme successfully obtained an insurancecontract through a Paris-based reinsurer to provide insurance tothe Ethiopian government, which assures capital for relief effortsin the case of extreme drought (Hess, 2007).
•The governments of Bermuda, Canada, France, and the UnitedKingdom, as well as the Caribbean Development Bank and theWorld Bank, have recently pledged substantial contributions toprovide start-up capital for the Caribbean Catastrophe RiskInsurance Facility (discussed in Section 7.4.4.2.5) (Cummins andMahul, 2009).
These early initiatives, especially micro-insurance schemes, are showing
promise in reaching the most vulnerabl e, but also demonstrate signifi cant
challenges to scaling up current operations. Lack of data, regulation,trust, and knowledge about insurance, as well as high transaction costs,are some of the barriers (Hellmuth et al., 2009).
As discussed in Case Study 9.2.13, insurance and other risk transfer
instruments can promote DRR and CCA in multiple ways by providingthe means to finance recovery, thus reducing long-term losses; addingto knowledge about risks; creating incentives (and imperatives) forrisk reduction; and providing the safety net necessary for farms andbusinesses to take on cost-effective, yet risky, investments that reducetheir vulnerability to climate change (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2009;Warner et al., 2009b). 
7.4.4.2.4. Alternative insurance instruments
Alternative insurance-like instruments, sometimes referred to as risk-linked securities, are financing devices that enable risk to be sold ininternational capital markets. Given the enormity of these markets, thereis a large potential for alternative or non-traditional risk financing,including catastrophic risk (CAT) bonds (explained below, and in Section6.3.3 and Case Study 9.2.13), industry loss warranties, sidecars (acompany purchases a portion or all of an insurance policy to share in theprofits and risks), and catastrophic equity puts, all of which are playingan increasingly important role in providing risk finance for large-lossChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales420events. A discussion of these instruments goes beyond the scope of this
chapter, but it is worth drawing attention to the most prominent risk-linked security, the CAT bond, which is a fully collateralized instrumentwhereby the investor receives an above-market return when a specificnatural hazard event does not occur (e.g., a Category 4 hurricane orgreater), but shares the insurer’s or government’s losses by sacrificinginterest or principal following the event if it does occur.
Over 90% of CAT bonds are issued by insurers and reinsurers in devel oped
countries. Although it is still an experimental market, CAT bondplacements more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, with a peak atUS$ 4.7 billion in 2006 (Cummins and Mahul, 2009), but declining toUS$ 3.4 billion in 2009 (Munich Re, 2010).
In 2006 and 2009, the first government-issued disaster relief CAT bond
placements were executed by Swiss Re and Deutsche Bank Securities toprovide funds to Mexico to insure its catastrophe fund FONDEN againstearthquake and (in 2009) hurricane risk, and thus to defray costs ofdisaster recovery and relief (Cardenas et al., 2007). The World Bankprovided technical assistance for these transactions. Although thetransaction costs of the Mexican CAT bond were large, and basis risk(the risk that the bond trigger will not be highly correlated with losses)is a further impediment to their success, it is expected that this form ofrisk transfer will become increasingly attractive especially to highlyexposed developing country governments (Lane, 2004). As discussed inChapter 6, a large number of government treasuries are vulnerable tocatastrophic risks, and post-disaster financing strategies generally havehigh opportunity costs for developing countries.
International and donor organizations have played an important role in
another case of sovereign risk transfer (discussed in Section 9.2.13). In2006, the World Food Programme purchased an index-based insuranceinstrument to support the Ethiopian government-sponsored ProductiveSafety Net Programme, which provides immediate cash payments in thecase of food emergencies. While this transaction relied on traditionalreinsurance instruments, there is current interest in issuing a CAT bondfor this same purpose. Tomasini and Van Wassenhove (2009) note theimportant role that securitized instruments can play in providing backupfor humanitarian aid when disasters strike.
7.4.4.2.5. Regional risk pools
Regional catastrophe insurance pools are a promising innovation that
can enable highly vulnerable countries, and especially small states, to
more affordably transfer their risks internationally. By amalgamating
risks across individual countries or regions and accumulating reservesover time, catastrophe insurance pools generate diversification benefits
that can eventually reduce insurance premiums. There is also growingempirical evidence that catastrophe insurance pools have been able to
diversify intertemporally and thus dampen the volatility of the reinsur ance
pricing cycle and offer secure premiums to the insured governments
(Cummins and Mahul, 2009).As a recent example (discussed in Section 6.3.3 and Case Study 9.2.13),
the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) was establishedin 2007 to provide Caribbean Community governments with an insuranceinstrument at a significantly lower cost (about 50% reduction) than if
they were to purchase insurance separately in the financial markets.Governments of 16 island states contributed resources commensurate
with their exposure to earthquakes and hurricanes, and claims will bepaid depending on an index for hurricanes (wind speed) and earthquakes
(ground shaking). Early cash payments received after an event will helpto mitigate the typical post-disaster liquidity crunch (Ghesquiere et al.,2006; World Bank, 2007a,b).
7.4.4.3. Value Added by International Interventions
International financial institutions, donors, and other international actorshave played a strongly catalytic role in the development of catastrophicrisk-financing solutions in vulnerable countries, most notably by:
•Exercising convening power , for example, the World Bank coordinated
the development of the CCRIF (Cummins and Mahul, 2009)
•Supporting public goods for development of risk market infrastructure,
for example, donors might consider funding the weather stationsnecessary for index-based weather derivatives
•Providing technical assistance , for example, the World Food
Programme carried out risk assessments and provided otherassistance to support the Ethiopian sovereign risk transfer (Hess,2007), and the World Bank provided technical assistance for theMexican CAT bond (Cardenas et al., 2007)
•Enabling markets , for example, DFID is active in creating the legal
and regulatory environment to facilitate access to banking services,which, in turn, greatly expedite remittances (DFID, 2005; Pickens etal., 2009)
•Financing risk transfer , as examples, the Bill Gates Foundation
subsidizes micro-insurance in Ethiopia (Suarez and Linnerooth-Bayer, 2010); the World Bank provides low-cost capital backing forthe Mongolian micro-insurance program (Skees et al., 2008); theSwiss SECO and the IADB provide low-interest credit to the ELF(UNFCCC, 2008); and many countries have contributed to theCCRIF reserve fund (Cummins and Mahul, 2009).
Though only a few of many examples of involvement by the international
community in risk-sharing and transfer projects, they show thatinternational financial institutions and development/donor organiza tions
can assist and enable risk-sharing and transfer initiatives in diverseways, which raises the question of their value added. Largely uncontestedis the value of creating the institutional conditions necessary forcommunity-based risk sharing and market-based risk transfer, yet, directfinancing, especially of insurance, is controversial. Critics point to the‘economic efficiency principle’ discussed in Section 7.2.2, and arguethat public and international support, especially in the form of premiumsubsidies, can distort the price signal and weaken incentives for takingpreventive measures, thus perpetuating vulnerability. Supporters pointto the ‘solidarity principle’ discussed in Section 7.2.3 and the importantChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales421role that solidarity has played in the social systems of the developed
world (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2008). Other types of assistance,like providing reinsurance to small insurer s, can crowd out the (emerg ing)
role of the private market. Finally, critics point out that it may be more
efficient to provide the poor with cash grants than to subsidize insurance(Skees, 2001; Guren ko, 2004).
Recognizing these concerns, there may be important and valid reasons
for interfering in catastrophe insurance and other risk-financing marketsin specific contexts (see discussions by Cummins and Mahul, 2009;Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2010), especially if:
• The private market is non-existent or embryonic, in which case
enabling support (e.g., to improve governance, regulatoryinstitutions, as well as knowledge creation) may be helpful.
• The private market does not function properly, in particular, if
premiums greatly exceed the actuarially fair market price due, forexample, to limitations on private capital and the uncertainty andambiguity about the frequency and severity of future losses(Kunreuther and Michel-Kerjan, 2009). In this case economicallyjustified premiums that are lower than those charged by theimperfect private market may be appropriate (Froot, 1999; Cutlerand Zeckhauser, 2000).
• The target population cannot afford sufficient insurance coverage,
in which case financial support that does not appreciably distortincentives may be called for. The designers of the Mongolianprogram, for example, argue that subsidizing the ‘upper layer’ isless price-distorting than subsidizing lower layers of risk becausethe market may fail to provide insurance for this layer (Skees et. al.,2008).
• The alternative is providing ‘free’ aid after the disaster happens.
7.4.5. Knowledge Acquisition, Management,
and Dissemination
A close integration of DRR and CCA and their mainstreaming into
sustainable development agendas for managing risks across scales calls formultiple ways of knowledge acquisition and development, management,sharing, and dissemination at all levels. Knowledge on the level ofexposure to hazards and vulnerabilities across temporal and geograph ical
scales (Louhisuo et al., 2007; Heltberg et al., 2008; Kaklauskas et al.,
2009); the legal aspects of DRM and CCA; financing mechanisms atdifferent scales; and information on access to appropriate technologies
and risk-sharing and transfer mechanisms for disaster risk reduction
(see Sections 7.4.1-7.4.4) are key to integrated risk management.Collaboration among scientists of different disciplines, practitioners,
policymakers, and the public is pertinent in knowledge acquisition,management, and accessibility (Thomalla et al., 2006). The type, level of
detail, and ways of generation and dissemination of knowledge will also
vary across scales, that is, from the local level where participatory
approaches are used to incorporate indigenous knowledge and buildcollective ownership of knowledge generated, to national and broader
regional to international levels, thus upholding the principle of subsidiarityin the organization, sharing, and dissemination of information on disaster
risk management (Marincioni, 2007; Chagutah, 2009). 
An internationally agreed mechanism for acquisition, storage and
retrieval, and sharing of integrated climate change risk information,knowledge, and experiences is yet to be established (Sobel and Leeson,2007). Where this has been achieved it is fragmented, assumes a top-down approach, is sometimes carried out by institutions with no clearinternational mandate, and the quality of the data and its coverage areinadequate. In other cases a huge amount of information is collectedbut not efficiently used (Zhang et al., 2002; Sobel and Leeson, 2007).Access to data or information under government institutions is oftenconstrained by bureaucracy and consolidating shared information canbe hampered by multiple formats and incompatible data sets. The majorchallenge in achieving coordinated integrated risk management acrossscales is in establishing clear mechanisms for a networked program togenerate and exchange diverse experiences, tools, and information thatcan enable various DRR and CCA actors at different levels to use differentoptions available for reducing climate risks. Such a mechanism willsupport efforts to mainstream CCA and DRR into development, forexample, in the case of initiatives by UNDP; development organizationssuch as the World Bank, DFID, and the IADB; the Canadian InternationalDevelopment Agency; the European Commission; and so forth (Bensonand Twigg, 2007). Accounting for climate risks within the developmentcontext will, among other things, be effectively achieved whereappropriate information and knowledge of what is required exist andare known and shared efficiently (Ogallo, 2010).
7.4.5.1. Knowledge Acquisition
Knowledge acquisition by nature is a complex, continuous, nonlinear,and life-long process that spans generations. Knowledge acquisition forDRR and CCA involves acquisition, documentation, and evaluation ofknowledge for its authenticity and applicability over time and beyond itspoint of origin (Rautela, 2005). Knowledge acquisition and documentationhas to focus on the shifting emphasis by the HFA from reactive emergencyrelief to proactive DRR approaches by aiming at strengthening prevention,mitigation, and preparedness and linking with changes in CCA thatinclude greater focus on local scales (refer to Section 7.4.3.2). TheGlobal Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI), which aims to coordinate andsupport the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures worldwide,provides important services for a proactive DRR approach (Köhler and
Wächter, 2006). One of the major breakthroughs facilitating the creationof the GSDI has been the development of interoperability standardsand technology that form a common foundation for the sharing andinteroperability of, for example, geospatial data. However, globalgeospatial data infrastructure is still largely underutilized for site- and/orapplication-specific needs (Le Cozannet et al., 2008; Di and Ramapriyan,2010).
There are huge efforts in DRR- and CCA-related knowledge acquisition,
development, and exchange by universities, government agencies,Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales422international organizations, and to some extent the private sector, but
coordination of these efforts internationally is yet to be achieved(Marincioni, 2007). At the international level, the International Councilfor Science (ICSU) is the main international body that facilitates andfunds efforts to generate global environmental change information thatextends into DRR and CCA. ICSU is an NGO with a global membershipof national scientific bodies (121 members) and international scientificunions (30 members) that maintain a strong focus on natural sciences(www.icsu.org). However, there have been changes over the years andICSU now works closely with the International Social Science Council(ISSC). There are four major global environmental change (GEC) researchprograms facilitated by ICSU: an International Programme of BiodiversityScience (DIVERSITAS), the International Geosphere BiosphereProgramme, the International Human Dimensions Programme closelytied to the ISSC, and the World Climate Research Programme. Theseprograms have been supported by a capacity-building and informationdissemination wing, the System for Analysis, Research and Training. Thefour GEC programs have had a significant role in generating thebackground science that forms the basis for CCA and DRR (Steffen etal., 2004). The link between science and policy within the UN system forCCA is achieved through the IPCC process while for DRR it is throughactivities of the UNISDR.
There has been growing concern that GEC programs are not integrated
and provide fragmented information limited to certain disciplines. Thisconcern led to the establishment of the Earth System SciencePartnership aiming to integrate natural and social sciences from theregional to the global scale. However, this has proved inadequate tomeet the growing need for integrated information (Leemans et al.,2009). As a result, a major restructuring of the knowledge generationprocess both at the institutional and science level has been launched byICSU and the main focus is on increased use of integrated approachesand co-production of knowledge with potential users to deliver regionallyand locally relevant information to address environmental risks forsustainable development. These initiatives will influence the process ofintegration of DRR and CCA and their linkages to development in thefuture (ICSU, 2010; Reid et al., 2010). 
An assessment of climate services for DRR and CCA is given in Section
7.3.3.2. But the generation of climate change information has followed
a top-down approach relying on global models to produce broad-scaleinformation with no clear local context and usually with largeuncertainties and complex for the public to assimilate hence providing
lower incentive for policymakers to act on the risks that are indicated(Weingart et al., 2000; Schipper and Pelling, 2006). Climate change
information is primarily provided at long temporal ranges, for example,2050, which is far beyond the usual five-year attention span of most
political governments let alone that of poor people concerned with basicneeds. Climate information at all scales is essential for decisionmaking
although there are various factors other than climate information that
ultimately influence decisionmaking. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report
will cover near-term climate extending to periods earlier than 2050. Effortsto enhance delivery of information at interannual to interdecadal scaleswill improve assimilation of climate information in risk management
(Goddard et al., 2010; Vera et al., 2010). However, expressing impacts,vulnerability, and adaption require description of complex interactionsbetween biophysical characteristics of a risk and socioeconomicfactors and relating to factors that usually span far beyond the areaexperiencing the risk. Communicating these linkages has been a chal lenge
particularly for areas where education levels are low and communicationinfrastructure is inadequate (Vogel and O’Brien, 2006). 
Knowledge acquisition and documentation requires capacity in terms of
skilled manpower, infrastructure, and appropriate institutions and funding
(Section 7.4.3.1). Long-term research and monitoring with a wide global
coverage of different hazards and vulnerabilities is required (Kinzig, 2001).For example, forecasting a hazard is a key aspect of disaster preventionbut generating such information comes with a cost. Although weatherforecasting through the meteorological networks of WMO is improving,the network of meteorological stations is far from spatially adequateand some have ceased to operate or are not adequately equipped(Ogallo, 2010). Forecasters are challenged to communicate forecaststhat are often characterized by large uncertainty but which need to beconveyed in a manner that can be readily understood by policymakersand the public (Vogel and O’Brien, 2006; Carvalho, 2007). 
Interdisciplinary generation of information – that is, bridging the
traditional divide among the social, natural, behavioral, and engineeringsciences – continues to be a great intellectual challenge in climate changerisk reduction. The newly formed Integrated Research on Disaster Risk(IRDR) program – co-sponsored by ICSU, ISSC, and UNISDR – aims atapplying an integrated approach in understanding natural and human-induced environmental hazards (ICSU, 2008; McBean, 2010). IRDR isintended to address these challenges and gradually provide relevantdata, information, and knowledge on vulnerability trends, which arekey information for policy- and decisionmakers to formulate integratedpolicies and measures for DRR and CCA.
7.4.5.2. Knowledge Organization, Sharing, and Dissemination
Exchange of disaster information worldwide has increased tremendouslythrough, for example, mass media and information and communicationtechnologies (ICT). The role of mass media in addressing the broaderneeds of DRR and CCA as opposed to disaster response is still limited,although various regional initiatives such as the Network of ClimateJournalists of the Greater Horn of Africa (NECJOGHA) that involve climateand media experts are being established to improve the situation (Ogallo,2010). NECJOGHA serves to disseminate integrated information basedon, for example, environmental monitoring, climatology, agronomy, publichealth, and so forth, to the users to enhance sustainable response toclimate change. Clearly, multiple strategies for disseminating and sharingknowledge and information are required for different needs at differentscales (Glik, 2007; Maitland and Tapia, 2007; Maibach et al., 2008;Saab et al., 2008; see also Chapters 5 and 6). In particular, greater efforts
are needed to identify and communicate information on vulnerabilityChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales423development, going beyond and adding to the hazards information, to
effectively contribute to reducing risk.
Disaster response and recovery are closely linked to provision of effective
communication prior to and throughout the disaster situation (Zhang etal., 2002). Mass media, for example, radio, television, and newspapers arepowerful mechanisms for conveying information during and immediatelyafter disasters although they may over-sensationalize issues, which mayinfluence perception of risk and subsequent responses (Vasterman etal., 2005; Glik, 2007). A ‘two-step flow’ approach where the mass mediais combined with interpersonal communication channels has been foundto provide a more effective approach to information dissemination(Maibach et al., 2008; Chagutah, 2009; Kaklauskas et al., 2009). 
Increased use of ICT such as mobile phones, online blogging websites
with interactive functions and links to other web pages and real-timecrowd-sourcing electronic commentary, and other forms of web-basedsocial-networked communications such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.,represent current tools for timely information dissemination. Theyfacilitate rapid exchange of information, for instance, from the disasterscene to rescuers and/or delivery of vital information to those affected. Thisis particularly the case where such information is given in an appropriateformat and language and facilities to deliver information are accessible(Glik, 2007). There are emerging attempts to develop mobile phone-based disaster response services, for example, that can translate disasterinformation into different languages (Hasegawa et al., 2005); and usereal-time mobile phone-calling data to provide information on locationand movement of victims in a disaster area (Madey et al., 2007). Mobilephones are now routinely used to disseminate disaster warning informationwithin industrialized countries and the process is rapidly expanding todeveloping countries. 
Information sharing and dissemination for disaster relief has improved
through the establishment of the ReliefWeb site (www.reliefweb.int) bythe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in1996. ReliefWeb so far offers the largest Internet-based internationaldisaster information gathering, sharing, and dissemination mechanism(Wolz and Park, 2006; Maitland and Tapia, 2007; Saab et al., 2008). TheInternational Charter (www.disasterscharter.org) provides space data
that serve to augment the ReliefWeb. But the OCHA ReliefWeb does not
cover preparedness and disaster prevention to fully embrace CCAand DRR compared to the comparatively more recent PreventionWeb
(www.preventionweb.net) where disaster risk reduction is covered.
Despite the growing role of mass media and ICT in disaster response,
significant improvements are still needed to reduce disaster losses. The
full potential of mobile phones and Internet facilities in disaster relief
has yet to be exploited. The OCHA ReliefWeb poorly represents local-
to national-level humanitarian activities; for example, most of this
information is not translated into different languages (Wolz and Park,
2006). There are large sections of the global population who have noaccess to Internet and other telecommunication services (Samarajiva,
2005) although evidence shows that improved access by disaster workershas overall positive effects on disaster relief (Wolz and Park, 2006).
Other initiatives such as RAdio and InterNET (RANET), a satellite broadcastservice that combines radio and Internet to communicate hydro-meteorological and climate-related information, are examples ofinnovative measures being put in place to address the problem oflimited access to the Internet in developing countries (Boulahya et al.,2005). Sustainable use of ICT for coordination of information forhumanitarian efforts faces challenges of limited resources to mount,maintain, and upgrade these systems (Saab et al., 2008). ICT is alsolimited to explicit knowledge that is comprised of, for example, docu ments
and data stored in computers but generally lacks tacit knowledge thatis based on experience linked to someone’s expertise, competence,understanding, professional intuition, and so forth that can be valuablefor disaster relief (Kaklauskas et al., 2009). Increased internationalcollaboration on disaster management and also the growing use ofinteractive web communication facilities provides for the filtering oftacit knowledge.
7.4.5.2.1. Disaster risk reduction and
climate change adaptation
In addition to disaster management organizations such as UNISDR, the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, theFederal Emergency Management Agency, national Red Cross and RedCrescent societies, and so forth, a great deal of knowledge disseminationis accomplished in the academic field. But this knowledge does nottranslate automatically to the general public. The use of ICTs such ascomputer networks, digital libraries, satellite communications, remotesensing, grid technology, and GIS for data and information integrationfor knowledge acquisition and exchange is growing to be important inintegrating DRR and CCA (UNISDR, 2005b; Louhisuo et al., 2007; seealso Section 7.4.3.2). ICT offers interactive modes of learning that couldbe of value in distance education and online data sharing and retrieval.For example, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters(CRED) at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium maintains theEmergency Events Database (EM-DAT), which has over 18,000 entrieson disasters in the world dated from 1900 to present (www.cred.be).The data are recorded on a country-level basis and form a usefulresource for disaster preparedness and vulnerability assessments,although information on small-scale disasters is difficult to establish(Tschoegl , 2006). In addition to CRED, a comprehensive database ofglobal natural catastrophe losses is provided by the Munich ReNatCatSERVICE, where nearly 800 events are entered in the databaseevery year; by 2009, the database had more than 25,000 entries withlosses spanning from the 1980s, although records for major events goup to 2000 years ago (Schmidt et al., 2009; Zschocke and de Leon,2010). Because of its strong focus on insured losses, the Munich Redatabase tends to have less coverage for areas with lower insurancecoverage. At a regional level, the DesInventar database in Latin Americais an example of a regional database that was developed in 1994 bythe Network for Social Studies in Disaster Prevention. The DesInventardatabase is an inventory of small-, medium-, and greater -impact disas tersChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales424(www.desinventar.net) and aims to facilitate dialog for risk management
between actors, institutions, sectors, and provincial and nationalgovernments. This initiative has been extended to the Caribbean, Asia,and Africa by UNDP , while the UNFCCC provides a more local-scaledatabase on local coping strategies (maindb.unfccc.int/public/adaptation).
ICT capabilities in disaster risk reduction also lie in enhancing interaction
among individuals and institutions from the national, to regional, tointernational level, for example, through e-mail, newsgroups, onlinechats, mailing lists, and web forums (Marincioni, 2007). Attempts havebeen made, for example, in Japan, to create an integrated disaster riskreduction system where mobile phone communication operates as partof a greater information generation and delivery chain that includesEarth observation data analysis, navigation and web technologies, GIS,and advanced information technology such as grid (Louhisuo et al.,2007). When such innovations are transferred to other regions theycontribute to international DRR efforts.
Other initiatives include NetHope International, which combines
development and disaster issues into its ICT-centric mandate (Saab et al.,2008). RANET (www.oar.noaa.gov/spotlite/archive/spot_ranet.html),originally developed in Africa for drought and which spread to Asia,Pacific, Central America, and the Caribbean, has a strong communityengagement and disseminates comprehensive information from globalclimate data banks combined with regional and local data and forecastsresulting in spinoffs to food security, agriculture, and health in rural areas(Boulahya et al., 2005). A network of extension agents, developmentpractitioners, and trained members of the community are used inRANET to translate information into local contexts and languages andas a result, RANET is being considered for other educational initiativessuch as the Spare Time University to improve access to learning in DRRwith benefits for CCA (Glantz, 2007). RANET has been found to reducevulnerability to climate extremes in different areas in Africa, for example,communication of rainfall forecasts in parts of west Africa assists farmerswith decisions on what crop variety to plant and field to use where achoice of fields of different soil type existed, and also where to searchfor pasture and water for livestock during drought periods. However,RANET faces challenges of unavailability of technical support, follow-up
training, power supply, and coordination (Boulahya et al., 2005).
The establishment of the PreventionWeb facility by UNISDR demonstrates
the potential of ICT in information sharing for international disaster risk
management across scales. PreventionWeb has been evolving since
2006, and was built on the experience of ReliefWeb with the purpose of
becoming a single entry point to the full range of global disaster riskreduction information and providing a common platform for institutions
to connect, exchange experiences, and share information on DRR, and
facilitating integration with CCA and the development process. Updated
daily, the PreventionWeb platform contains news, DRR initiatives, event
calendars, online discussions, contact directories, policy and reference
documents, training events, terminology, country profiles, and fact sheetsas well as audio and video content. Hence, while catering primarily to
DRR professionals, it also promotes better understanding of disaster riskby non-specialists. PreventionWeb is a response to a need for greater
information and knowledge sharing and dissemination advanced in Zhanget al. (2002), Marincioni (2007), Kaklauskas et al. (2009), and others. Theweb site serves a critical role in supporting the implementation of theHFA where information and knowledge sharing is essential (Zschockeand de Leon, 2010). But the full potential of PreventionWeb has yet tobe realized and evaluated since it is a relatively new initiative. 
In addition to the PreventionWeb with a DRR focus, the number of web-
based resource portals supporting both DRR and CCA has beenincreasing. These include, among others, ProVention Consortium,which had a DRR and climate focus (www.proventionconsortium.org)but has ceased to operate; the UN Adaptation Learning Mechanism(www.adaptationlearning.net) with links to related online resourcesand documentation of over 140 countries; Linking Climate AdaptationNetwork/CBA-X (www.linkingclimateadaptation.org) which has some DRRfocus, had over 1,000 members in 2008, and has continued to providecurrent thinking on climate adaptation and resources and publicationsfor researchers, practitioners, and policy formers; and the WeAdapt/WikiAdapt, an adaptation focus portal (www.weadapt.org) that goesbeyond networking and dissemination to cover knowledge integrationand other innovative adaptation tools. These portals are relatively new,remain predominantly used by their respective communities, and havealso been noted by others to be poorly organized (Mitchell and vanAalst, 2008). Performance of such ICT information resources in disasterrisk management could improve with more coordination and integrationof CCA, DRR, and the development community.
7.4.5.2.2. Constraints in knowledge sharing and dissemination
For all information tools noted, the quality of information transferred andlanguage used influence their effectiveness. Further, these mechanismsoften collapse during a disaster when most needed (Marincioni, 2007;Saab et al., 2008). Some of the new technologies are not easily accessibleto the very poor, and even the most innovative tools like RANET shownumerous maintenance constraints particularly in remote areas(Boulahya et al., 2005). 
There are differences in perception on the role of ICT in the exchange of
disaster and hazard risk knowledge as opposed to its role in increased flowof information, with knowledge here defined simply as understanding ofinformation while information refers to organized data (Zhang et al.,2002; Marincioni, 2007). Indications are that, while there is increasedcirculation of disaster information, this does not always result inincreased assimilation of new risk reduction approaches, a factor that ispartly attributed to lack of effective sharing although lack of capacity touse/apply the information could be a major factor (Zhang et al., 2002;UNISDR, 2005b).The level of assimilation of ICT technology into disasterrisk reduction depends, among other things, on levels of literacy andthe working environment including institutional arrangements, henceeffectiveness may vary with levels of development (Samarajiva, 2005;Marincioni, 2007; see also Section 7.4.3.2). As a result, the contributionChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales425of these relatively new facilities such as PreventionWeb will, among
other things, depend on accessibility and assimilation of ICT in thedaily operations of institutions across the globe. Evidence shows thatinformation alone is not adequate to address disaster risk reduction; rather,other factors such as availability of resources, effective managementstructures, and social networks are critical (Glik, 2007; Lemos et al.,2007; Maibach et al., 2008; Chagutah, 2009).
A major constraint in climate change risk management results from the
fact that communities working in disaster management, climate change,and development operate separately and this increases vulnerability toclimate extremes leading to disasters (Schipper and Pelling, 2006;Lemos et al., 2007). For example, emphasis on humanitarian assistancehas been attributed to development agendas that do not adequatelyintegrate risk reduction leading to increased vulnerability (Benson andTwigg, 2007), while development community members are, for example,better equipped with the use of insurance but fail to link this to climaterisk reduction thus exposing communities to vulnerability to climateextremes. Similar observations have been made about cities whereurban developers have no link with the climate risk managementcommunity (Wamsler, 2006). But in fact both the development and climateadaptation communities are concerned with vulnerability to disasters.This could be a common point of focus facilitating collaboration inresearch, information sharing, and practice as part of global security(Schipper and Pelling, 2006; Lemos et al., 2007). 
Communication gaps between professional groups often result from
different language styles and jargons. Heltberg et al. (2008) havesuggested a need for establishing universally shared basic operationaldefinitions of key terms such as risk, vulnerability, and adaptationacross the different actors as a basis for dissemination of knowledge.This has also been noted by others, for example, for better coordinationamong numerous humanitarian organizations (Saab et al., 2008) and inthe FAO guide for disaster risk management (Baas et al., 2008; also seeChapter 1). The move toward establishment of national disaster riskreduction institutions that link to similar regional and internationalstructures by, for example, UNISDR, provides a framework for bringingdifferent stakeholders together including the climate change anddevelopment communities at the national level, culminating in greater
integration of risk management at the international level. Other efforts
include international initiatives to integrate, at the national level, disasterrisk reduction with poverty reduction frameworks (Schipper and Pelling,
2006).
In conclusion, there is high agreement in the literature indicating that
efforts are being made internationally to build information and knowl edge
bases that support the shift in emphasis by the HFA from reactiveemergency relief to proactive DRR ( high confidence ). Conventional media
and ICT are major factors in facilitating the required international
exchange and dissemination of information on disaster response, CCA,
and DRR ( high confidence ). This in turn stimulates generation of new
knowledge and will over time lead to greater integration of DRR and CCA,which at the present moment is still limited ( medium confidence ). Thelimitation of relying heavily on ICT is that there is still a large part of the
world where the ICT infrastructure is not adequately developed. There isalso high agreement in the literature that an increase in the exchange
of data and information at the international level on its own is not acomplete solution to risk reduction. Resources to generate and supplyinformation and experience in a usable form for each unique case so asto translate this to knowledge and action are a critical dimension in riskreduction ( high confidence ). Further, more attention is required for the
international community to identify what information is essential fordifferent stages of climate change risk management, and how it shouldbe captured and used by different actors under different risk reduction
scenarios. Data gathering, information, and knowledge acquisition and
management for disaster relief has a longer history. The process ofbuilding integrated information resource tools that brings togetherexperiences from CCA, DRR, and the development community is stillweak, yet these tools hold the promise for reducing vulnerability todisasters in the future ( high confidence ).
7.5. Considerations for
Future Policy and Research
How best can experience with disaster risk reduction at the international
level be used to help or strengthen climate change adaptation? Thecharacteristics of the DRR regime (as exemplified chiefly by the UNISDRand the Hyogo Framework for Action) and the CCA regime (chiefly theUNFCCC and the IPCC) have been described in detail and assessed tothe extent that the literature allows. One frequently made assumptionis that the DRR world has much to learn from CCA and vice versa (IPCC,2009). It is widely proposed in the literature that disaster risk reductionand climate change adaptation should be ‘integrated’ (Birkmann and vonTeichman, 2010).
The call for integration of disaster risk reduction with climate change
adaptation goes much further, however (UNISDR, 2009a). It is arguedthat both disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation remainoutside the mainstream of development activities (UNISDR, 2009a). TheUnited Nations Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reductioncalls for “an urgent paradigm shift” in disaster risk reduction to addressthe underlying risk drivers such as vulnerable rural livelihoods, poorurban governance, and declining ecosystems (UNISDR, 2009a). Thereport also calls for the harmonization of existing institutional andgovernance arrangements for disaster risk reduction and climatechange adaptation (p. 181), and presents a 20-point plan to reduce risk(pp. 176-177). 
These conclusions come from an official UN report (UNISDR, 2009a),
and they are widely supported in the scientific literature (O’Brien et al.,2006; Schipper, 2009) as well as in other government reports (DFID,2005; Birkmann et al., 2009; CCD, 2009) and in the advocacy literature(Venton and La Trobe, 2008). More recently, the widely reviewed ICSU(2010) report (called the Belmont Challenge) on Regional EnvironmentalChange: Human Action and Adaptation, which was commissioned byChapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales426the major global environmental change research funders to assess the
international research capability required to respond to the challengeof delivering knowledge to support human action and adaptationto regional environmental change, concluded by calling for a highlycoordinated and collaborative research program to deliver integratedknowledge required to identify and respond to hazards, risks, andvulnerability, and develop mitigation and adaptation strategies.Similarly, ICSU and the ISSC carried out a wide consultative processto rethink the focus and framework of Earth system research. Thisconsultation came out with four Grand Challenges that require a balancedmix of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research to address critical issuesat the intersection of Earth systems science and sustainable development(Reid et al., 2010):
•Improve the usefulness of forecasts of future environmentalconditions and their consequences for people.
•Develop, enhance, and integrate observation systems to manageglobal and regional environmental change.
•Determine how to anticipate, avoid, and manage disruptive globalenvironmental change.
•Determine institutional, economic, and behavioral changes to enableeffective steps toward global sustainability.
Both the Belmont Challenge and the Grand Challenges are setting an
international tone for an integrative approach to challenges such asDRR, CCA, and development. There is no shortage of policy proposalsdesigned to integrate disaster risk reduction and climate changeadaptation for their common strengthening and benefit. 
Official reports also list many reasons why more movement in this
direction has been slow to develop. One constraint is the difficulty ofintegration across scales, which is addressed in Section 7.6. Two othersets of constraints are described as ‘the normative dimension’ and ‘theknowledge dimension’ (Birkmann et al., 2009). The extensive list ofchallenges and constraints identified includes the following:
•Normative Dimensions (adapted from Birkmann et al., 2009)
–Absence of uniform methods, standards, and procedures in
vulnerability and capacity assessment and also in the design,formulation, and implementation of adaptation plans, programs,
and projects. Lack of clear norms when applying vulnerabilityand capacity assessment and when designing and implementingadaptation measures
–The desire for stability and the tendency to rapidly restore
normalcy limit the scope to explore and to take advantage of theopportunity after disaster and recover in an adaptive way bytaking account of future climate change. The notion and desire
for stability may hamper the chance to take advantage of change
and dynamics – after disasters, the chance to use the opportu nity
and build back in an adaptive way considering future climatechange is in most cases not taken – more commonly, infrastructure
is rapidly built back to the pre-disaster condition
•Knowledge Challenges (adapted from Birkmann et al., 2009)
–Differences in the form of terminology used – that is, the different
terms and definitions framed by both DRR and CCA communities–Unavailability of information about the concrete effects ofclimate change at the local level (see Section 7.4.5.1)
–Limited census-based information on relevant census data(social and economic parameters) especially in dynamic areaswith, for example, high fluctuations of people and/or economicinstability
–Scientific knowledge on climate change acquired by the scientificcommunity has not been translated or trickled down topractitioners or it is communicated in a way that is hard to
understand and derive practical knowledge (see Section 7.4.5.2.2)
–Absence or lack of appropriate indicators for assessment thatcould measure successful adaptation and which could also be
incorporated into funding guidelines as well as monitoring andevaluation strategies (ICSU, 2010).
For the purposes of this Special Report, the question has been formulated
in terms of what can be learned from the practice of DRR to advanceCCA. It is clear from the literature, however, that cooperation betweenthe DRR and CCA communities is a two-way process. This has given riseto questions about how ‘integration’ in practice at local and nationallevels might best be facilitated by change at the international level.
7.6. Integration across Scales
7.6.1. The Status of Integration
The literature reflects three different perspectives on the integration ofdisaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. One viewcommon among the community of experts and practitioners is thatclimate change adaptation should be integrated into disaster riskreduction (CCD, 2008a,b,c; Prabhakar et al., 2009, p. 26). It has evenbeen suggested that climate change adaptation is a case of ‘reinventingthe wheel’ (Mercer 2010) since disaster risk reduction covers much of thesame ground and is “already well-established within the internationaldevelopment community” (Lewis, 1999; Wisner et al., 2004).Practitioners in disaster risk reduction tend to have the view that climatechange is one of a number of factors contributing to vulnerability anddisasters (Mercer, 2010), and that therefore climate change adaptationneeds to be taken on board.
A second view is adopted by many in the climate change adaptation
community. They recognize a diversity of cross-cutting risks that can beassociated with the impacts of climate change and consider disaster riskto be one of these (Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010). They concludethat disaster risk reduction should be integrated into climate changeadaptation. 
A third and perhaps more widespread view is that both disaster risk
reduction and climate change adaptation should be more effectivelyintegrated into wider development planning (Glantz, 1999; O’Brien etal., 2006; Lewis, 2007; CCD, 2009; Christoplos et al., 2009; UNISDR,2009a).Chapter 7 Managing the Risks: International Level and Integration across Scales427At the practical level there are many steps already underway to bring
about such forms of integration (see Chapters 5 and 6). There arenumerous hazards and disasters that are not directly linked to climatechange but their impacts may serve to increase vulnerability to climatechange. Nevertheless, as noted in Section 7.5 there are many obstaclesto integration and it is by no means agreed that full integrationbetween disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation ispossible, or desirable.
The potential benefits as well as the obstacles to integration can be
examined in terms of three scales: the spatial, the temporal, and thefunctional (Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010). 
7.6.2. Integration at a Spatial Scale
The literature reflects a view that DRR and CCA operate at differentspatial scales (Birkmann and von Teichman, 2010) and that therefore theirintegration in practice has been problematic or impracticable. Disastersare often thought of as events occurring at a specific location whereasclimate change is thought of as a global or regional phenomenon. Thisview is now being modified as the need for locally based climatechange adaptation becomes evident (Adger et al., 2005), as the impactsof local disasters are recognized as having more widespread impacts ata larger spatial scale (see Chapters 4 and 6 and Section 7.2.1).
One commonly cited impediment to integration is that climate change
projections do not provide precise information at a local scale (seeChapter 3) and that adaptation strategies tend to be designed for entirecountries or regions (German Federal Government, 2008; Red Cross andRed Crescent Climate Centre, 2007). 
7.6.3. Integration at a Temporal Scale
There is also a perceived difference in the temporal scales of CCAand DRR. The disaster community has traditionally been focused onhumanitarian response including relief and reconstruction in the relativelyshort term. (UNISDR, 2009b), whereas climate change has beenrecognized as including long-term processes with projections extending
from decades to centuries (Chapter 3), which poses problems fordevelopment communities usually focusing on a shorter time span.
More effective cooperation and integration between the DRR and the
CCA practitioners could help to detect, address, and overcome thesetemporal-scale challenges. This essentially requires the strongerrecognition of the risks of climate-related disasters in CCA and the
incorporation of longer-term climate change risk factors into DRR. 
7.6.4. Integration at a Functional Scale
The functional separation of CCA and DRR institutions, organizations,
and mechanisms extends across all three levels of management fromlocal to national to international. At the international level there are
weak links between the climate adaptation ‘regime’ as expressed in theUNFCCC and the leading DRR ‘regime’ in the form of the UNISDR. Thecharacter of the two ‘regimes’ is radically different, the former havingthe task of implementing an international agreement and the latterbeing a UN-wide interagency and advocacy program. The history of theevolution of the two institutional arrangements is markedly different.The disaster field has long been dominated by humanitarian andemergency response measures and has only relatively recently beenmoving toward a stronger DRR approach (Burton, 2003). Similarly,climate change was initially conceived as an atmospheric pollutionissue with greater emphasis on the need to reduce greenhouse gasemissions and has slowly been repositioned, as in the UNFCCCnegotiations, as also being a development issue. One consequence ofthe different evolution has been that the emerging international climate‘regime’ (UNFCCC) is linked at the national level to environmentministries, whereas the disaster ‘regime’ (UNISDR) is linked to emergencyplanning and preparedness agencies or, in other cases, to the office ofPresident. Neither DRR nor CAA are well linked to economic planningand development agencies (UNISDR, 2009b).
There is also a ‘top-down’ versus ‘bottom-up’ distinction (Rayner, 2010).
Natural hazards and associated disasters have a long history, and DRRhas moved slowly from local to national to international levels inresponse to the rationale described in Section 7.2. Climate change, onthe other hand, came to attention as a result of the work of atmosphericscientists and was first recognized primarily as a global problem, andhas subsequently moved down scale as the need for CCA becamemore apparent and pressing. This shows that the opportunity existsfor the two to complement each other, at the international level whereDRR has progressed, and at the national and local level to which CCAis moving. 
7.6.5. Toward More Integration
The mandate of this Special Report is in part to consider how CCA couldbe enhanced by learning from the experience of the DRR community,and vice versa. The literature shows a widespread view that the twocould both benefit from closer integration with each other and thatboth would benefit society better if there was more integration intosustainable development (UNISDR, 2009a). Integration in this sense ismeant as symbiosis or synthesis rather than formal integration at theinstitutional level. Integration across scales can be facilitated ifintegration between DRR and CCA were also to take place at local,national, and international levels. Integration at the international levelmight help to facilitate integration at national and local levels althoughthe opposite is also possible. This Special Report is itself a prime exampleof emerging cooperation. It is in line with a wider evolution in the globalenvironmental change science research community whose productsserve both disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation at theinternational level of management.

Table of Contents439Actions that range from incremental steps to transformational changes are essential for reducing risk from
weather and climate extremes ( high agreement, robust evidence ).[8.6, 8.7] Incremental steps aim to improve
efficiency within existing technological, governance, and v alue systems, whereas transformation may involve alterations
of fundamental attributes of those systems. The balance between incremental and transformational approachesdepends on evolving risk profiles and underlying social and ecological conditions. Disaster risk, climate changeimpacts, and capacity to cope and adapt are unevenly distributed.  Vulnerability is often concentrated in poorer countries
or groups, although the wealthy can also be vulnerable to extreme events. Where vulnerability is high and adaptivecapacity relatively low, changes in extreme climate and weather events can make it difficult for systems to adaptsustainably without transformational changes. Such transformations, where they are required, are facilitated throughincreased emphasis on adaptive management, learning, innovation, and leadership.
Evidence indicates that disaster risk management and adaptation policy can be integrated, reinforcing,
and supportive – but this requires careful coordination that reaches across domains of policy and practice(high agreement, medium evidence ).[8.2, 8.3, 8.5, 8.7] Including disaster risk management in resilient and
sustainable development pathways is facilitated through integrated, systemic approaches that enhance capacity tocope with, adapt to, and shape unfolding processes of change, while taking into consideration multiple stressors,different prioritized values, and competing policy goals. 
Development planning and post-disaster recovery have often prioritized strategic economic sectors and
infrastructure over livelihoods and well-being in poor and marginalized communities. This can generatemissed opportunities for building local capacity and integrating local development visions into longer-termstrategies for disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change ( high agreement, robust evidence ).
[8.4.1, 8.5.2] A key constraint that limits pathways to post-disaster resilience is the time-bound nature of reconstructionfunding. The degradation of ecosystems providing essential services also limits options for future risk managementand adaptation actions locally.
Learning processes are central in shaping the capacities and outcomes of resilience in disaster risk
management, climate change adaptation, and sustainable development ( high agreement, robust evidence ).
[8.6.3, 8.7] An iterative process of monitoring, research, evaluation, learning, and innovation can reduce disaster risksand promote adaptive management in the context of extremes. Technological innovation and access may help achieveresilience, especially when combined with capacity development anchored in local contexts.
Progress toward resilient and sustainable development in the context of changing climate extremes can
benefit from questioning assumptions and paradigms, and stimulating innovation to encourage new
patterns of response ( medium agreement, robust evidence ). [8.2.5, 8.6.3, 8.7] Successfully addressing disaster
risk, climate change, and other stressors often involves embracing broad participation in strategy development, the
capacity to combine multiple perspectives, and contrasting ways of organizing social relations.
Multi-hazard risk management approaches provide opportunities to reduce complex and compound hazards
in rural and urban contexts ( high agreement, robust evidence ).[8.2.5, 8.5.2, 8.7] Considering multiple types of
hazards reduces the likelihood that risk reduction efforts targeted at one type of hazard will increase exposure and
vulnerability from other hazards, both in the present and future. Building adaptation into multi-hazard risk management
involves consideration of current climate variability and projected changes in climate extremes, which pose different
challenges to affected human and natural systems than changes in the means. Where changes in extremes cause
greater stresses on human and natural systems, direct impacts may be more unpredictable, increasing associatedadaptation challenges. 
The most effective adaptation and disaster risk reduction actions are those that offer development benefits
in the relative near term, as well as reductions in vulnerability over the longer term ( high agreement,Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future
Executive Summary440medium evidence ). [8.2.1, 8.3.1, 8.3.2, 8.5.1, 8.6.1] There are tradeoffs between current decisions and long-term
goals linked to diverse values, interests, and priorities for the future. Short-term and long-term perspectives on bothdisaster risk management and adaptation to climate change thus can be difficult to reconcile. Such reconciliationinvolves overcoming the disconnect between local risk management practices and national institutional and legalframeworks, policy, and planning. Resilience thinking offers some tools for reconciling short- and long-term responses,including integrating different types of knowledge, an emphasis on inclusive governance, and principles of adaptivemanagement. However, limits to resilience are faced when thresholds or tipping points associated with social and/ornatural systems are exceeded. 
Building a strong foundation for integrating disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change
includes making transparent the values and interests that underpin development, including who wins andloses from current policies and practices, and the implications for human security ( high agreement, medium
evidence ). [8.2.3, 8.2.4, 8.4.2, 8.4.3, 8.6.1.2] Both disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change share
challenges related to (1) reassessing and potentially transforming the goals, functions, and structure of institutionsand governance arrangements; (2) creating synergies across temporal and spatial scales; and (3) increasing access toinformation, technology, resources, and capacity. These challenges are particularly demanding in countries and localitieswith the highest climate-related risks and weak capacities to manage those risks. Countries with significant capacityand strong risk management records also benefit from addressing these challenges. 
Social, economic, and environmental sustainability can be enhanced by disaster risk management and
adaptation approaches. A prerequisite for sustainability is addressing the underlying causes of vulnerability,including the structural inequalities that create and sustain poverty and constrain access to resources(medium agreement, robust evidence ). [8.6.2, 8.7] This involves integrating disaster risk management in other
social and economic policy domains, as well as a long-term commitment to managing risk. 
The interactions among climate change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk management will have a
major influence on resilient and sustainable pathways ( high agreement, low evidence ). [8.2.5, 8.5.2, 8.7]
Interactions between the goals of mitigation and adaptation in particular will play out locally, but have globalconsequences. 
There are many approaches and pathways to a sustainable and resilient future. Multiple approaches and
development pathways can increase resilience to climate extremes ( medium agreement, medium evidence ).
[8.2.3, 8.4.1, 8.6.1, 8.7] Choices and outcomes for adaptive actions to climate extremes must reflect divergentcapacities and resources and multiple interacting processes. Actions are framed by tradeoffs between competingprioritized values and objectives, and different visions of development that can change over time. Iterative, reflexiveapproaches allow development pathways to integrate risk management so that diverse policy solutions can beconsidered, as risk and its measurement, perception, and understanding evolve over time. Choices made today canreduce or exacerbate current or future vulnerability, and facilitate or constrain future responses.Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future4418.1. Introduction
This chapter focuses on the implications of changing climate extremes
for development, and considers how disaster risk management andclimate change adaptation together can contribute to a sustainable andresilient future. Changes in the frequency, timing, magnitude, and
characteristics of extreme events pose challenges to the goals of reducing
disaster risk and vulnerability, both in the present and in the future (seeChapter 3). Enhancing the capacity of social-ecological systems to copewith, adapt to, and shape change is central to building sustainable andresilient development pathways in the face of climate change. Theconcept for social-ecological systems recognizes the interdependence ofsocial and ecological factors in the generation and management of risk,as well as in the pursuit of sustainable development. Despite 20 yearson the policy agenda, sustainable development remains contested andelusive (Hopwood et al., 2005). However, within the context of climatechange, it is becoming increasingly clear that the sustainability of humanson the Earth is closely linked to resilient social-ecological systems, which
is influenced by social institutions, human agency, and human capabilities(Pelling, 2003; Bohle et al., 2009; Adger et al., 2011).
Extremes are translated into impacts by the underlying conditions of
exposure and vulnerability associated with development contexts. Forexample, there is robust evidence that institutional arrangements and
governance weaknesses can transform extreme events into disasters(Hewitt, 1997; Pelling, 2003; Wisner et al., 2004; Ahrens and Rudolph,2006). The potential for concatenated global impacts of extreme eventscontinues to grow as the world’s economy becomes more interconnected,but in relative terms most impacts will occur in contexts with severeenvironmental, economic, technological, cultural, and cognitive limits toadaptation (see Section 5.5.3). In relation to extreme events, global riskassessments show that social losses – as well as economic losses as aproportion of livelihood or GDP – are disproportionately concentrated indeveloping countries, and within these countries in poorer communities
and households (UNDP , 2004; UNISDR, 2009, 2011; World Bank, 2010a). 
This chapter recognizes that outcomes of changing extreme events depend
on responses and approaches to disaster risk reduction and climatechange adaptation, both of which are closely linked to developmentprocesses. The assessment of literature presented in this chapter showsthat changes in extreme events call for greater alignment and integra tion
of climate change responses and sustainable development strategies,and that this alignment depends on greater coherence between short-and long-term objectives. Yet there are different interpretations ofdevelopment, d ifferent preferences and prioritized values and motivations,
different visions for the future, and many tradeoffs involved. Researchon the resilience of social-ecological systems provides some lessons foraddressing the gaps among these objectives. Transformative social,economic, and environmental responses can facilitate disaster riskreduction and adaptation (see Box 8-1). Transformations often includequestioning of social values, institutions, and technical practices (Loorbachet al., 2008; Hedrén and Linnér, 2009; Pelling 2010a). A resilient andsustainable future is a choice that involves proactive measures thatpromote transformations, including adaptive management, learning,innovation, and leadership capacity to manage risks and uncertainty. 
In this chapter, we assess a broad literature presenting insights on how
diverse understandings and perspectives on disaster risk reduction andclimate change adaptation can help to promote a more sustainable andresilient future. Drawing on many of the key messages from earlierchapters, the objective is to assess scientific knowledge on theincremental and transformative changes needed, particularly in relationto integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptationinto development policies and pathways. Bringing together experiencefrom a range of disciplines, this chapter identifies proven pathways thatcan help move from an incremental to an integrative approach that also

Box 8-1 | Transformation in Response to Changing Climate Extremes
Transformation involves fundamental changes in the attributes of a system, including value systems; regulatory, legislative, or  bureaucratic
regimes; financial institutions; and technological or biophysical systems (see Glossary). This chapter focuses on the transform ation of
disaster risk management systems in the context of climate extremes, through integration with climate change adaptation strateg ies and
wider systems of human development. This is similar to, yet distinct from, other types of transformation associated with climat e change.
For example, there have been attempts to understand climate change and development failures by identifying the scope for politi cal
(Harvey, 2010), social (Kovats et al., 2005), economic (Jackson, 2009), and value (Leiserowitz et al., 2006) transformation, an d so too for
disaster risk management (Klein, 2007). Across these cases, observed processes of stasis and change are analogous (often using common
language), but actors and objectives are distinct. That said, transformation in wider political, economic, social, and ethical systems can
open or close policy space for a more resilient and sustainable form of disaster risk management (Birkland, 2006), just as acts  aimed at
transformation in managing climate extremes can have implications for wider systems. This is particularly true where contempora ry
development goals, paths, and hierarchies are identified and addressed as part of the root or proximate causes of vulnerability  and risk,
that is, when they are seen as part of the solution for building resilient and sustainable futures (Wisner, 2003; Pelling, 2010 a). Although
there has been some research on how and why social lock-in makes it difficult to move away from established development priorit ies
and trajectories (Pelling and Manuel-Navarrete, 2011), there has been only limited academic work to date on the ways in which w ider
transformations impact on disaster risk management, and vice versa.442embraces transformation – as illustrated in Figure 8-1, which depicts
resilience as a moving target that is positioned somewhere between theacceptability of residual risk and the costs of risk management. The targetmoves as the relationship between risk and uncertainty changes (drivenby climate extremes, as well as development trends such as urbaniza tion)
in relation to the capacity for risk management (which integrates climatechange adaptation, disaster risk management, and development). Asrisk and uncertainty increase, incremental adjustments in practices mayno longer be sufficient to achieve resilience, and at some point thegrowing resilience gap will provoke a search for transformative solutions.
Through enhanced experimentation and learning approaches, climatechange adaptation, disaster risk management, and development may
provide a pathway for keeping pace with the dynamic drivers and
expressions of risk.
After this introduction, this chapter discusses the relationship between
disaster risk management, climate change adaptation, and sustainableand resilient development (Section 8.2), highlighting the synergies andconflicts between these objectives and the common obstacles to reaching
them (Section 8.2.1) and the specific role of ecosystems and biodiversity(Section 8.2.2). In particular, it emphasizes the importance of values and
perceptions (Section 8.2.3) and the role of technologies (Section 8.2.4) in
designing sustainability policies. Finally, it highlights the importance of
tradeoffs between temporal scales, spatial scales, and multiple stressors(Section 8.2.5). 
Focusing on time perspectives, Section 8.3 then discusses options to
integrate short- and long-term objectives, by looking at the long-term
consequences of present-day responses to disasters (Section 8.3.1),investigating the barriers to integrating short- and long-term responses
(Section 8.3.2), and proposing options to overcome these barriers andpromote resilience (Section 8.3.3). 
Section 8.4 assesses the implications of disaster risk reduction and
climate change adaptation for equity and access to resources, and inparticular the importance of capacities and resource availability toimplement policies for adaptation and disaster risk reduction (Section8.4.1). It also highlights the existence of losers and winners fromdisasters and disaster risk reduction and adaptation policies (Section8.4.2), and the consequences of these distributive effects for humansecurity (Section 8.4.3) and for the possibility to achieve internationalgoals such as the Millennium Development Goals (Section 8.4.4). 
Section 8.5 focuses on the specific issue of combining disaster risk
management and adaptation with climate change mitigation policies. Itstarts by stressing the role of thresholds and tipping points as limitsto what can be achieved in terms of disaster risk management andadaptation, and thus the importance of considering the three policiestogether (Section 8.5.1). It then discusses synergies and conflictsbetween mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk management in urbanand rural areas (Section 8.5.2). 
Section 8.6 identifies the tools and options to promote resilience to
climate extremes and combine adaptation, disaster risk management,and other policy goals. It first discusses various approaches to planningfor the future, including the use of scenarios (Section 8.6.1). It thenhighlights the existence of a continuum of options to make progressover the short and long term, from incremental to transformationalChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future

use of analysis and modeling tools to improve disaster risk managementand adaptation (Section 8.6.2.1), the implementation of new institutionaltools (Section 8.6.2.2), and transformational strategies to reach multipleobjectives (Section 8.6.2.3). Such transformational changes can befacilitated using a combination of approaches (Section 8.6.3), includingadaptive management (Section 8.6.3.1), learning (Section 8.6.3.2),innovation (Section 8.6.3.3), and leadership (Section 8.6.3.4). The chapterconcludes (Section 8.7) by discussing synergies between disaster riskreduction and climate change adaptation to achieve a resilient andsustainable future.
8.2. Disaster Risk Management as Adaptation:
Relationship to Sustainable DevelopmentPlanning 
Earlier chapters discussed the concepts of and relationship between
disaster risk management (including disaster risk reduction) and climatechange adaptation. The two concepts and practices overlap considerablyand are strongly complementary. Disaster risk management considershazards other than those that are climate-derived, such as earthquakesand volcanoes, while climate change adaptation considers and addressesvulnerabilities related to phenomena that would not normally beclassified as discrete disasters, such as gradual changes in precipitation,temperature, or sea level. Examples of hazards that are addressed byboth communities include flooding, droughts, and heat waves.
Disaster risk management is increasingly considered as one of the
‘frontlines’ of adaptation, and perhaps one of the most promisingarenas for mainstreaming or integrating climate change adaptation intosustainable development planning (Sperling and Szekely, 2005; G. O’Brienet al., 2006; Schipper and Pelling, 2006; Schipper, 2009). However, itrequires modifying development policies, mechanisms, and tools, andidentifying and responding to those who gain and lose from living withand creating risk. Contested notions of development and hence differingperspectives on sustainable development planning lead to differentconclusions about how disaster risk reduction can contribute to adaptation.
This section reviews the definitions of some of the key concepts used in
this chapter, and considers the roles that ecosystems services, valuesand perceptions, technologies, and tradeoffs in decisionmaking can play
in influencing sustainable development planning and outcomes. It also
considers the tradeoffs that are involved in decisionmaking.
8.2.1. Concepts of Adaptation, Disaster Risk Reduction,
and Sustainable Development and how they areRelated
Adaptation can be defined as the process of adjustment to actual or
expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or exploit
beneficial opportunities (see Section 1.1.2). Adaptation actions may beundertaken by public or private actors, and can be anticipatory orreactive, and incremental or transformative (Adger et al., 2007; Stafford
Smith et al., 2011). In both principle and practice, adaptation is morethan a set of discrete measures designed to address climate change; itis an ongoing process that encompasses responses to many factors,including evolving experiences with both vulnerabilities and vulnerabilityreduction planning and actions, as well as risk perception (Tschakert
and Dietrich, 2010; Weber, 2010; Wolf, 2011). 
Adaptive capacity underlies action and is defined in this report as the
combination of strengths, attributes, and resources available to anindividual, community, society, or organization that can be used toprepare for and undertake adaptation. Adaptive capacity can also bedescribed as the capability for innovation and anticipation (Armitage,2005), the ability to learn from mistakes (Adger, 2003), and the capacityto generate experience in dealing with change (Berkes et al., 2003).Enhancing adaptive capacity under climate change entails payingattention to learning about past, present, and future climate threats,accumulated memory of adaptive strategies, and anticipatory action toprepare for surprises and discontinuities in the climate system (Nelsonet al., 2007). 
Adaptive capacity is uneven across and within sectors, regions, and
countries (K. O’Brien et al., 2006). Although wealthy countries andregions have more resources to direct to adaptation, the availability offinancial resources is only one factor determining adaptive capacity (Mosset al., 2010; Ford and Ford, 2011). Other factors include the ability torecognize the importance of the problem in the context of multiplestresses, to identify vulnerable sectors and communities, to translatescientific knowledge into action, and to implement projects and programs(Moser and Ekstrom, 2010). The capacity to adapt is in fact dynamicand influenced by economic and natural resources, social networks,entitlements, institutions and governance, human resources, andtechnology (Parry et al., 2007). It is particularly important to understandthat places with greater wealth are not necessarily less vulnerable toclimate impacts and that a socioeconomic system might be as vulnerableas its weakest link (K. O’Brien et al., 2006; Tol and Yohe, 2007). Therefore,even wealthy locations can be severely impacted by extreme events,socially as well as economically, as Europeans experienced during the2003 heat wave (Salagnac, 2007; see also Case Study 9.2.1).
Current adaptation planning in many countries, regions, and localities
involves identification of a wide range of options, although the availableknowledge of their costs, benefits, wider consequences, potentials, andlimitations is still incomplete (NRC, 2010; see Section 4.5). In many cases,the most attractive adaptation actions are those that offer developmentbenefits in the relatively near term, as well as reductions of vulnerabilitiesin the longer term (Agrawala, 2005; Klein et al., 2007; McGray et al., 2007;Hallegatte, 2008a; NRC, 2010). This is a lesson already noted, though notalways practiced, in disaster preparedness and risk reduction (IFRC,2002; Pelling, 2010b). An emerging literature discusses adaptationthrough the lens of sustainability, recognizing that not all adaptationresponses are necessarily benign; there are tradeoffs, potentials fornegative outcomes, competing interests, different types of knowledge,Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future444and winners and losers inherent in adaptation responses (Eriksen and
O’Brien, 2007; Ulsrud et al., 2008; Barnett and O’Neill, 2010; Beckman,2011; Brown, 2011; Eriksen et al., 2011; Gachathi and Eriksen, 2011;Owuor et al., 2011). Sustainable adaptation is defined as a processthat addresses the underlying causes of vulnerability and poverty,including ecological fragility; it is considered a way of generating socialtransformation, or changes in the fundamental attributes of society thatcontribute to vulnerability (Eriksen and O’Brien, 2007; Eriksen and Brown,2011). 
Disaster risk can be defined in many ways (see Section 1.1.2). In general,
however, it is closely associated with the concepts of hazards, exposure,and vulnerability. Hazards are defined in this report as the potentialoccurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event that maycause negative consequences. Exposure is defined as the presence ofpeople, livelihoods, environmental services and resources, infrastructure,and economic, social, and cultural assets in places that could beadversely affected by climate extremes. Hazards and exposure arechanging, not only as the result of climate change, but also due tohuman activities. For example, hazards associated with floods, landslides,storm surges, and fires can be influenced by declines in ecosystemservices that regulate runoff, erosion, etc. The drainage of wetlands,deforestation, the destruction of mangroves, and the changes associatedwith urban development (such as the impermeability of surfaces andoverexploitation of groundwater) are all factors that can modifyhazard patterns (Nobre et al., 1991, 2005; MEA, 2005; Nicholls etal., 2008). Consequently, most weather-related hazards now have ananthropogenic element (Cardona, 1999; Lavell, 1999). 
Vulnerability has many different (and often conflicting) definitions and
interpretations, both across and within the disaster risk and climatecommunities (see Sections 1.1.2 and 2.2). Vulnerability can increase ordecrease over time as a result of both environmental and socioeconomicchanges (Blaikie et al., 1994; Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008). In general,improvements in a country’s development indicators have been associatedwith reduced mortality risk, yet an increase in economic loss and insuranceclaims (UNDP , 2004; Pielke Jr. et al., 2008; Schumacher and Strobl, 2008;ECA, 2009; UNISDR, 2009; World Bank, 2010a). Indeed, recent evidenceconfirms that, despite increasing exposure, mortality risk from tropicalcyclones and floods is now decreasing globally, as well as in heavily
exposed regions like Asia (UNISDR, 2011). In contrast, the risk ofeconomic loss is increasing globally because reductions in vulnerability
are not compensating for rapid increases in the exposure of economicassets. In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries, for example, economic losses are increasing at a fasterrate than GDP per capita. In other words, the risk of losing wealth indisasters is increasing faster than that wealth is being created (UNISDR,
2011). However, some types of development may increase vulnerability
or transfer it between social groups, particularly if development is
unequal or degrades ecosystem services (Guojie, 2003). Even wheregrowth is more equitable, vulnerabilities can be generated (e.g., whenmodern buildings are not constructed to prescribed safety standards)(Hewitt, 1997; Satterthwaite, 2007).Climate change can magnify many preexisting risks through changes in
the frequency, severity, and spatial distribution of weather-relatedhazards, as well as through increases in vulnerability due to climateimpacts (e.g., decreased water availability, decreased agriculturalproduction and food availability, or increased heat stress) (see Section4.3). Like adaptation, disaster risk reduction may be anticipatory(ensuring that new development does not increase risk) or corrective(reducing existing risk levels) (Lavell, 2009). Given expected populationincreases in hazard-prone areas, anticipatory disaster risk reduction isfundamental to addressing the risk associated with future climateextremes. At the same time, investments in corrective disaster riskreduction are required to address the accumulation of exposure andsusceptibility to existing climate risks, for example, those inherited frompast urban planning or rural infrastructure decisions. 
Climate change adaptation and disaster risk management (especially
disaster risk reduction) are critical elements of long-term sustainabilityfor economies, societies, and environments at all scales (Wilbanks andKates, 2010). The generally accepted and most widespread definition ofsustainable development comes from the Brundtland CommissionReport, which defined sustainable development as “development thatmeets the needs of the present without compromising the ability offuture generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987). A numberof principles of sustainable development have emerged, including theachievement of a standard of human well-being that meets humanneeds and provides opportunities for social and economic development;that sustains the life support systems of the planet; that broadensparticipation in development processes and decisions; and that acceler ates
the movement of knowledge into action in order to provide a widerrange of options for resolving issues (WCED, 1987; Meadowcroft, 1997;NRC, 1999; Swart et al., 2003; MEA, 2005). Because sustainabledevelopment means finding pathways that achieve socioeconomic andenvironmental goals without sacrificing either, it is a concept that isfundamentally political (Wilbanks, 1994).
Discussions of the relationships between sustainable development and
climate change have increased over the past decades (Cohen et al., 1998;Yohe et al., 2007; Bizikova et al., 2010). The literature on developmenthas considered how development paths relate to vulnerabilities both toclimate change and to climate change policies (e.g., Davis, 2001; Garget al., 2009), as well as to other hazards. Clearly, some climate change-related environmental shifts are potentially threatening to sustainabledevelopment, but they can also help move toward sustainability,especially if the trends or events are severe enough to require significantadjustment of unsustainable development practices or developmentpaths (e.g., the relocation of population or economic activities to lessvulnerable areas). In such cases, both disaster risk reduction and climatechange adaptation can be important – even essential – contributors tosustainable development.
There are some examples of successful decreases in vulnerability
through disaster risk management, but less evidence in relation to climate
change adaptation, in part because the ability to attribute observed
Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future445environmental stresses from and responses to climate change is still
limited (Fankhauser et al., 1999; Adger et al., 2007; Repetto, 2008). Interms of disaster risk reduction, a large number of lives have been savedover the last decade due to improved disaster early warning systems(IFRC, 2005), and to increased development and human welfare(UNISDR, 2011). There remains, however, much more that can be doneto reduce mortality and counteract growth in the number of peopleaffected by disasters and climate extremes. For example, recent self-assessments of progress by over 100 countries on the objectives of theHyogo Framework of Action (UNISDR, 2009, 2011) indicate that fewdeveloping countries have conducted comprehensive, accurate, andaccessible risk assessments, which are a prerequisite for bothanticipatory and corrective disaster risk reduction. Furthermore, theassessment shows that few countries are able to quantify their invest ment
in disaster risk reduction. There are numerous ways to evaluate success ofdisaster risk management or climate adaptation, including gauging theextent to which the goals of a given action (determined in anticipationof a given environmental stressor) are achieved, independent of whetherthe environmental stressor materializes. Both climate adaptation anddisaster risk management can contribute to responses to changes inextreme events due to climate change, yet neither approach alone issufficient.
Econometric analyses at the national scale have reached different
conclusions about the impact of disasters on economic growth, but thebalance of evidence suggests a negative impact. Whereas Noy andNualsri (2007), Noy (2009), Hochrainer (2009), Jaramillo (2009), andRaddatz (2007) suggest that the overall impact on growth is negative,Albala-Bertrand (1993) and Skidmore and Toya (2002) argue that naturaldisasters have a positive influence on long-term economic growth, oftendue to both the stimulus effect of reconstruction and the productivityeffect. As suggested by Cavallo and Noy (2009) and Loayza et al. (2009),this difference may arise from the different impacts of small and largedisasters, the latter having a negative impact on growth and the formerenhancing growth. In any case, whether or not disaster losses translateinto other social and economic impacts depends on how each individualdisaster is managed (Moreno and Cardona, 2011) which in turn is relatedto capacities and political priorities. At the local scale, Strobl (2011)investigates the impact of hurricane landfall on county-level economic
growth in the United States. This analysis shows that a county that is
struck by at least one hurricane in a year sees its economic growthreduced on average by 0.79%, and increased by only 0.22% the followingyear. Noy and Vu (2010) investigate the impact of disasters on economicgrowth at the province level in Vietnam, and find that lethal disasters
decrease economic production while costly disasters increase short-term growth. Rodriguez-Oreggia et al. (2009) focus instead on poverty
and the World Bank’s Human Development Index at the municipality
level in Mexico. They show that municipalities affected by disasters
experienced an increase in poverty by 1.5 to 3.6%. Considering theseimportant links between disasters and development, there is a needto consider disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and
sustainable development in a consistent and integrated framework (G.
O’Brien et al., 2006; Schipper and Pelling, 2006). 8.2.2. Sustainability of Ecosystem Services
in the Context of Disaster Risk Managementand Climate Change Adaptation 
Reducing human pressures on ecosystems and managing natural
resources more sustainably can facilitate efforts to mitigate climatechange and to reduce vulnerabilities to extreme climate and weatherevents. The degradation of ecosystems is undermining their capacity to
provide ecosystem goods and services upon which human livelihoods andsocieties depend (MEA, 2005; WWF , 2010), and to withstand disturbances,
including climate change. There is evidence that the likelihood of collapseand subsequent regime shifts in ecological and coupled social-ecologicalsystems may be increasing in response to the magnitude, frequency,and duration of climate change and other disturbance events (Folke et al.,2004; MEA, 2005; Woodward, 2010). Large, persistent shifts in ecosystemservices not only affect the total level of welfare that people in acommunity can enjoy, they also impact the welfare distribution between
people within and between generations and hence may give rise to newconflicts over resource use and questions on inter-generational equity asa component of sustainable development (Thomas and Twyman, 2005).They could result in domino effects of increased pressure on successiveresource systems, as has been suggested in the case of depletion ofsuccessive fish stocks (Berkes et al., 2006). However, the thresholds atwhich ecosystems undergo regime shifts and the points at which thesemay catalyze social stress remain largely unknown, partly due tovariability over space and time (Biggs et al., 2009; Scheffer, 2009).
Ecosystems can act as natural barriers against climate-related hazardous
extremes, reducing disaster risk (Conde, 2001; Scholze et al., 2005). Forexample, mangrove forests are a highly effective natural flood controlmechanism that will become increasingly important with sea level rise,and are already used as a coastal defense against extreme climatic andnon-climatic events (Adger et al., 2005). The benefits of such ecosystemservices are determined by ecosystem health, hazard characteristics,local geomorphology, and the geography and location of the systemwith respect to the hazard (Lacambra and Zahedi, 2011). In assessingthe ecological limits of adaptation to climate change, Peterson (2009)emphasizes that ecosystem regime shifts can occur as the result ofextreme climate shocks, but that such shifts depend upon the resilienceof the ecosystem, and are influenced by processes operating at multiplescales. In particular, there is evidence that the loss of regulating services(e.g., flood regulation, regulation of soil erosion) erodes ecologicalresilience (MEA, 2005).
Ecosystems and ecosystem approaches can also facilitate adaptation to
changing climatic conditions (Conde, 2001; Scholze et al., 2005).Conservation of water resources and wetlands that provide hydrologicalsustainability can further aid adaptation by reducing the pressures andimpacts on human water supply, while forest conservation for carbonsinks and alternative sources of energy such as biofuels can reducecarbon emissions and have multiple benefits (Reid, 2006), as can coastaldefenses and avalanche protection (Silvestri and Kershaw, 2010). InNew York, for example, untreated storm water and sewage regularlyChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future446flood the streets because the aging sewage system is no longer
adequate. After heavy rains, overflowing water flows directly into riversand streams instead of reaching water treatment plants. The USEnvironmental Protection Agency has estimated that around US$ 300billion over 20 years would be needed to upgrade sewage infrastructureacross the country (UNISDR, 2011). In response, New York City willinvest US$ 5.3 billion in green infrastructure on roofs, streets, andsidewalks. This promises multiple benefits: the new green spaces mayabsorb more rainwater and reduce the burden on the city’s sewagesystem, improve air quality, and reduce water and energy costs. Suchchanges in the constituents of an ecosystem can be used as levers toenhance the resilience of coupled social-ecological systems (Biggs et al.,2009). 
Biodiversity is also important to adaptation. Functionally diverse systems
have more scope to adapt to climate change and climate variability thanfunctionally impoverished systems (Elmqvist et al., 2003; Hughes et al.,2003; Lacambra and Zahedi, 2011). A larger gene pool will facilitate theemergence of genotypes that are better adapted to changed climaticconditions. Conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecosystemintegrity may therefore be a key objective in improving the adaptivecapacity of society to cope with climate change extremes (Peterson etal., 1997; Elmqvist et al., 2003; SCBD, 2010). 
Strategies that are adopted to reduce climate change through greenhouse
gas mitigation can affect biodiversity both negatively and positively(Edenhofer et al., 2011), which in turn influences the capacity to adaptto climate extremes. For example, some bioenergy plantations replacesites with high biodiversity, introduce alien species, and use damagingagrochemicals, which in turn may reduce ecosystem resilience andhence their capacity to respond to extreme events (Foley et al., 2005;Fargione et al., 2009). Large hydropower schemes can cause loss ofterrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, inhibit fish migration, and lead tomercury contamination (Montgomery et al., 2000), as well as changewatershed sediment dynamics, leading to sediment starvation in coastalareas, which in turn could lead to coastal erosion and make coasts morevulnerable to sea level rise and storm surges (Silvestri and Kershaw,2010). 
The increasing international attention and support for efforts focused
on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation,
maintaining/enhancing carbon stocks, and promoting sustainable forestmanagement (REDD+) is an example of where incentives for the
protection and sustainable management of natural resources driven by
mitigation concerns also have the potential of generating co-benefits
for adaptation. By mediating runoff and reducing flood risk, protectingsoil from water and wind erosion, providing climate regulation, and
providing migration corridors for species, ecosystem services supplied
by forests can increase the resilience to some climatic changes (Locatelli
et al., 2010). Primary forests tend to be more resilient to disturbance
and environmental changes, such as climate change, than secondaryforests and plantations (Thompson et al., 2009). However, forests are alsovulnerable to climatic extremes (Nepstad et al., 2007) and the modeledeffects of global warming (Vergara and Scholz, 2011). Hence, the role of
forest ecosystems in climate change mitigation and adaptation willitself depend on the rate and magnitude of climate change and whetherthe crossing of ecological tipping points can be avoided. 
8.2.3. The Role of Values and Perceptions
in Shaping Response
Values and perceptions are important in influencing action on climate
change extremes, and they can have significant implications forsustainable development. The disaster risk community has used severalpoints of view for resolving decisions about where to invest limited
resources, including considerations of economic rationality and moralobligation (Sen, 2000). Value judgments are embedded in problem
framing, solutions, development decisions, and evaluation of outcomes,thus it is important to make them explicit and visible. Values describewhat is desirable or preferable, and they can be used to represent thesubjective, intangible dimensions of the material and nonmaterial world(O’Brien and Wolf, 2010). They are closely linked to worldviews andbeliefs, including perceptions of change and causality (Rohan, 2000;Leiserowitz, 2006; Weber, 2010). Values both inform and are shaped byaction, judgment, choice, attitude, evaluation, argument, exhortation,rationalization, and attribution of causality (Rokeach, 1979). However,values do not always clearly translate to particular behaviors(Leiserowitz et al., 2005). Recognizing and reconciling conflicting valuesincreases the need for inclusiveness in decisionmaking and for findingways to communicate across social and professional boundaries(Rosenberg, 2007; Vogel et al., 2007; Oswald Spring and Brauch, 2011).
Losses from extreme events can have implications beyond objective,
measurable impacts such as loss of lives, damage to infrastructure, oreconomic costs. They can lead to a loss of what matters to individuals,communities, and groups, including the loss of elements of social capital,such as sense of place or of community, identity, or culture. This has longbeen observed within the disaster risk community (Hewitt, 1997; Mustafa,2005) and in more recent work in the climate change community (O’Brien,2009; Adger et al., 2010; Pelling, 2010a). A values-based approachrecognizes that socioeconomic systems are continually evolving, drivenby innovations, aspirations, and changing values and preferences of theconstituents (Simmie and Martin, 2010; Hedlund-de Witt, 2011). Thisapproach raises not only the ethical question of ‘whose values count?’,but also the important political question of ‘who decides?’. Thesequestions have been asked in relation to both disaster risk (Blaikie et al.,1994; Wisner, 2003; Wisner et al., 2004) and climate change (Adger,2004; Hunt and Taylor, 2009; Adger et al., 2010; O’Brien and Wolf, 2010),and are significant when considering the interaction of climate changeand disaster risk, including the complexity of the temporal consequencesof policies and decisions (Pelling, 2003).
The probabilistic risk assessments that form the basis for current
models of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) rarely take into account the widerconsequences that account for a substantial proportion of disasterChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future447damage for poorer households and communities (UNISDR, 2004, 2009;
Marulanda et al., 2010). These include outcomes such as increasedpoverty and inequality (Hallegatte, 2006; de la Fuente et al., 2009),health effects (Murray and Lopez, 1996; Grubb et al., 1999; Viscusi andAldy, 2003), cultural assets and historical building losses (ICOMOS,1998), and environmental impacts, which are often very difficult tomeasure in monetary terms. Specific approaches allow accounting fordistributive effects in CBA (e.g., distributional-weight CBA, seeHarberger, 1978; basic-needs CBA, see Harberger, 1984; or social welfarefunction built as a sum of individual welfare function that increasesnonlinearly with income), but none of them are consensual. Other types ofvaluation emphasize institutional elements such as the ‘moral economy’associated with the collective memory and identities of people living innon-western cultures in many parts of the world (Rist, 2000; Hughes,2001; Trawick, 2001; Scott, 2003). 
Two important philosophical value frameworks have dominated
attempts to establish priorities for risk management: human rights andutilitarian approaches. Human rights-based approaches (Wisner, 2003;Gardiner, 2010) emphasize moral obligation to reduce avoidable riskand contain loss, which was recognized in the UN Universal Declarationof Human Rights in 1948: Article 3 provides for the right to “life, libertyand security of person,” while Article 25 protects “a standard of livingadequate for the health and well-being … in the event of unemployment,sickness, disability, widowhood, or old age or other lack of livelihood incircumstances beyond his [sic] control.”
The humanitarian community, and civil society more broadly, has made
considerable progress in addressing these aspirations (Kent, 2001),perhaps best exemplified by the Sphere standards. These are a set ofself-imposed guidelines for good humanitarian practices that requireimpartiality in post-disaster actions including shelter management andaccess to and distribution of relief and reconstruction aid (Sphere,2004). The ethics and equity dimensions of risk management have alsobeen explored in adaptation through the application of Rawls’ theory ofjustice (Rawls, 1971; Paavola, 2005; Paavola and Adger 2006; Paavolaet al., 2006; Grasso, 2009, 2010). From this perspective, priority is givento reducing risk for the most vulnerable, even if this limits the absolutenumbers who benefit. 
In contrast to focusing on the most excluded or economically poor,
utilitarian approaches assume that interpersonal welfare comparisonsare possible, and that a social welfare function that summarizes thewelfare of a population can be built (Pigou, 1920). Assuming its existence,maximizing this social welfare function reveals where economic benefitsof public investments exceed costs. The calculated economic benefits of
investing in risk reduction vary, but are often considered significant (see
Ghesquiere et al., 2006; World Bank 2010a; UNISDR, 2011). There are,however, extreme difficulties in accounting for the complexity of disastercosts and risk reduction investment benefits (Pelling et al., 2002;
Hallegatte and Przyluski, 2010). A key point here is that value frameworkscan significantly influence the types of responses to climate and weatherextremes.8.2.4. Technology Choices, Availability, and Access
Technology choices can contribute to both risk reduction and riskenhancement, relative to extreme climate and weather events. Asdiscussed in Section 7.4.3, technologies receive prominent attention inboth climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Continuing
transitions from one socio-technological state to another frame many
aspects of responses to climate change risks. Assessments of roles oftechnology choices, availability, and access in responding to climateextremes are enmeshed in a wide range of technologies that must beconsidered within a broad range of development contexts. However, innearly every case, issues are raised about the balance between riskreduction and risk creation. Technology is a broad concept thatembraces a range of areas, including information and communicationtechnologies, roads and infrastructure, food and production technolo gies,
energy systems, and so on. Technology choices can alleviate disasterrisk, but they can also significantly increase risks and add to adaptationchallenges (Jonkman et al., 2010). For example, some modern energysystems and centralized communication systems are dependent onphysical structures that can be vulnerable to storm damage. It has beensuggested that relatively centralized high-technology systems are ‘brittle,’offering efficiencies under normal conditions but subject to cascadingeffects in the event of emergencies (Lovins and Lovins, 1982).
In many cases, technologies are considered to be an important part of
responses to climate extremes and disaster risk. This includes, for example,attention to physical infrastructure, including how to ‘harden’ builtinfrastructure such as bridges or buildings, or natural systems such ashillsides or river channels, such that they are able to withstand higherlevels of stress (UNFCCC, 2006; Larsen et al., 2007; CCSP , 2008). Anotherfocus is on technologies that assist with information collection anddiffusion, including technologies to monitor possible stresses andvulnerabilities, technologies to communicate with populations andresponders in the event of emergencies, and technology applications todisseminate information about possible threats and contingencies –although access to such technologies may be limited in some developingregions. Seasonal climate forecasts based on the results from numericalclimate models have been developed in recent decades to providemulti-month forecasts, which can be used to prepare for floods anddroughts (Stern and Easterling, 1999). Modern technological developmentis exploring a wide variety of innovative concepts that may eventuallyhold promise for disaster risk reduction, for example, through new foodproduction technologies, although ecological, ethical, and human healthimplications are often as yet unresolved (Altieri and Rosset, 1999).
Attention to technology alternatives and their benefits, costs, potentials,
and limitations in cases where disaster risk is created and when riskreduction takes place involve two different time horizons. In the nearterm, technologies to be considered are those that currently exist or thatcan be modified relatively quickly. In the longer term, it is possible toconsider potentials for new technology development, given identifiedneeds (Wilbanks, 2010). In some circumstances, technologies put inplace to reduce short-term risk and vulnerability can increase futureChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future448vulnerability to extreme events or ongoing trends. For example, the
use of irrigation has reduced farmer vulnerabilities to low and variableprecipitation patterns. However, when the irrigation water is from anonrenewable source (e.g., the Ogallala-High Plains aquifer system of theUnited States), the foreseeable reduction in future irrigation opportuni ties
would mean an increase in vulnerability and the risk of increasing cropfailures (AAG, 2003; Harrington, 2005).
Similarly, while large dams could mitigate drought and generate
electricity, well known costs of social and ecological displacement maybe unacceptable (Baghel and Nusser, 2010). Furthermore, unless damsare constructed to accommodate future climate change, they may presentnew risks to society by encouraging a sense of security that ignoresdepartures from historical experience (Wilbanks and Kates, 2010). In theMekong region, dikes, dams, drains, and diversions established for floodprotection have unexpected consequences for risk over the longer term,because they influence risk-taking behavior (Lebel et al., 2009). In theUnited States, past building in floodplain areas downstream from damsthat have now exceeded their design life has become a major concern;
tens of thousands of dams are now considered as having high hazardpotential (McCool, 2005; FEMA, 2009; ASCE, 2010). 
Investments in physical infrastructure cast long shadows through time,
because they tend to assume lifetimes of three to four decades or
longer. The gradual modernization of a city’s housing stock, transport, orwater and sanitation infrastructure takes many decades without targetedplanning. If they are maladaptive rather than adaptive, the consequencescan be serious. This suggests a reappraisal of technology that might
promote more distributed solutions, for example, multiple, smaller damsthat can resolve local as well as more distant needs, or widely spread,
local energy production (perhaps utilizing micro-solar, wind and water,
or geothermal power) that can reduce exposure to secondary impactsfrom natural disasters when large power generators or power transmission
lines are lost during a natural disaster, or when power plants generatesecondary disasters after being impacted by a natural hazard, as has
happened recently in Japan. The goal of a more distributed and lessmaximizing development vision has been expressed in Thailand’s‘Sufficiency Economy’ approach, where local development is judgedagainst its contribution to local, national, and international wealthgeneration (UNDP , 2007a). 
Technology choices, availability, and access depend on more than
technology development alone. Unless the technologies, the skillsrequired to use them, and the institutional approaches appropriate todeploy them are effectively transferred from providers to users(‘technology transfer’), the effects of technology options, howeverpromising, are minimized (see Section 7.4.3). Challenges in puttingscience and technology to use for sustainable development havereceived considerable attention (e.g., Nelson and Winter, 1982; Pateland Pavit, 1995; NRC, 1999; ICSU, 2002; Kristjanson et al., 2009),emphasizing the wide range of contexts that shape both barriers andpotentials. If obstacles related to intellectual property rights can beovercome, however, the growing power of the information technologyrevolution could accelerate technology transfer (linked with localknowledge) in ways that would be very promising (Wilbanks andWilbanks, 2010).
8.2.5. Tradeoffs in Decisionmaking: 
Addressing Multiple Scales and Stressors
Sustainable development involves finding pathways that achieve a
variety of socioeconomic and environmental goals, without sacrificingany one for the sake of the others. As a result, the relationships betweenadaptation, disaster risk management, and sustainability are highlypolitical. Successful reconciliation of multiple goals “lies in answers tosuch questions as who is in control, who sets agendas, who allocatesresources, who mediates disputes, and who sets rules of the game”Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future
FAQ 8.1 | Why is there not a greater emphasis on technology as the solution to climate extremes?
Technology is an essential part of responses to climate extremes, at least partly because technology choices and uses are so of ten a part
of the problem. Enhancing early warning systems is one example where technology can play an important role in disaster risk man agement.
This example also flags the importance of considering ‘hard’ (engineering) and ‘soft’ (social and administrative) technology. G reat
advances have been made in hard technology around hazard identification, and this has saved many lives. Communicating warningsthrough the ‘soft’ technology of institutional reform and communication networks has been less well developed. Both hard and so ft
technology systems must be responsive to different cultures, environments, and types of governance. Most fundamentally, it is c lear that
technologies are the product of research and development choices, which reflect particular values, interests, and priorities. T he successful
transfer of technology is sensitive to local needs, capacities, and development goals. Technologies can have unintended consequ ences
that contribute to maladaptations. For example, some modern agricultural technologies may reduce local biodiversity and constra in
future adaptation. Technologies only matter if they are both appropriate and accessible. Technology development and use are nec essary
for reducing vulnerabilities to climate extremes, both through mitigation and adaptation, but they need to be the right technol ogies that
are deployed in the right ways. This calls for greater reflection on the social, economic, and environmental consequences of te chnology
across both space and time. In many cases, responses to climate extremes can be improved by addressing social vulnerability, ra ther
than focusing exclusively on technological responses.449(Wilbanks, 1994, p. 544). This means that conflicts of interest must be
acknowledged and addressed, whether they are between governmentdepartments, sectors, or policy arenas, and suggests that simplepanaceas are unlikely without tradeoffs in decisionmaking (Brock andCarpenter, 2007).
There is no single or optimal way of adapting to climate change or
managing risks, because contexts for risk management vary so widely.For example, risk management decisions can be oriented towardincremental responses to frequent events that are disruptive butperhaps not ‘extreme.’ Often, tradeoffs between multiple objectives areambiguous. For example, focusing on and taking actions to protectagainst frequent events may lead to greater vulnerability to larger andrarer extreme events (Burby, 2006). This is a particular challenge forinvesting in fixed physical infrastructure. Social investments and riskawareness, including early warning systems, can be strengthened bymore frequent low-impact events that maintain risk visibility and allowpreparedness for larger, less frequent events (see Case Studies 9.2.11and 9.2.14). Pielke Jr. et al. (2007) also warn that locating adaptationpolicy in a narrow risk framework by concentrating only on identifiableanthropogenic risks can distort public policy because vulnerabilities arecreated through multiple stresses.
As one salient example, during disaster reconstruction, tensions fre quently
arise between demands for speed of delivery and sustainability of out come.
Response and reconstruction funds tend to be time-limited, often requiringexpenditure within 12 months or less from the time of disbursement.This pressure is compounded by multiple agencies working with oftenlimited coordination. Time pressure and competition between agenciestends to promote centralized decisionmaking and the subcontracting ofpurchasing and project management to non-local commercial actors.Both outcomes save time but miss opportunities to include local peoplein decisionmaking and learning from the event, with the resultingreconstruction in danger of failing to support local cultural and economic
priorities (Berke et al., 1993; Pearce, 2003). At the same time it is impor tant
not to romanticize local actors or their viewpoints, which might at timesbe unsustainable or point to maladaptation, or to accept local voicesas representative of all local actors. When successful, participatory
reconstruction planning has been shown to build local capacity andleadership, bind communities, and provide mechanisms for information
exchange with scientific and external actors (Lyons et al., 2010). As part
of any participatory or community-based reconstruction, the importanceof a clear conflict resolution strategy has been recognized.
Tradeoffs may also arise through conflicts between economic development
and risk management (Kahl, 2003, 2006). The current trend of developmentin risk-prone areas (e.g., coastal areas in Asia) is driven by socioeconomicbenefits yielded by these locations, with many benefits accruing toprivate investors or governments through tax revenue. For example,
export-driven economic growth in Asia favors production close to large
ports to reduce transportation time and costs. Consequently, theincrease in risk has to be balanced against the socioeconomic gains ofdevelopment in at-risk areas. Additional construction in at-risk areas isnot unacceptable a priori , but has to be justified by other benefits, and
sometimes complemented by other risk-reducing actions (e.g., earlywarning and evacuation, improved building norms, specific floodprotection). This introduces the possibility for those benefiting financiallyto offset produced risk through risk reduction mechanisms ranging fromfair wages and disaster-resistant housing (to enhance worker resilience)to support for early warning, preparedness, and reconstruction. Suchapproaches have been considered in some businesses through corporatesocial responsibility agendas (Twigg, 2001).
One climate change/development tradeoff linked both to timeframes
and the magnitude of climate extremes is the future need for riskreduction infrastructure that would require changes in ecologically orhistorically important areas. For example, when considering additionalprotection (e.g., dikes and seawalls) in historical centers, aesthetic andcultural elements as well as building costs will be taken into account.Existing planning and design standards to protect cultural heritage orecological integrity may need to be balanced with the needs of adapta tion
(Hallegatte et al., 2011a). Difficulties in attributing value to cultural andecological assets mean that CBAs are not the best tool to approachthese types of problems. Multi-criteria decisionmaking tools (Birkmann,2006) that incorporate a participatory element and can recognize thepolitical, ethical, and philosophical aspects of such decisions can also beuseful (Mercer et al., 2008). But the magnitude of emerging climateextremes is an important issue. If climate change is relatively severe,rather than moderate, then the focus on preserving iconic areas is likelyto increase, as will the costs.
Another contextual complication that introduces tradeoffs is the fact
that impacts of climate change extremes extend across multiple scales.The challenge is to find ways to combine the strengths of addressingmultiple scales, rather than having them work against each other(Wilbanks, 2007, 2009). Local scales offer potentials for bottom-upactions that ensure participation, flexibility, and innovation. At the sametime, efforts to develop initiatives from the bottom up are often limitedby a lack of information, limited resources, and limited awareness oflarger-scale driving forces (AAG, 2003). Larger scales offer potentials fortop-down actions that assure resource mobilization and cost sharing.Integrating these kinds of assets across scales is often essential forresilience to extremes, but in fact, integration is profoundly impeded bydifferences in who decides, who pays, and who benefits, and perceptions
of scalar effects that often reflect striking ignorance and misunderstanding(Wilbanks, 2007). In recent years, there have been a number of calls forinnovative co-management structures that cross scales in order topromote sustainable development (e.g., Bressers and Rosenbaum, 2003;Cash et al., 2006; Campbell et al., 2010). 
What might be done to realize potentials for integrating actions at
different scales to make them more complementary and reinforcing?Many top-down interventions (from international donor developmentand disaster response and reconstruction funding to new adaptationfund mechanisms and national programming) may unintentionallydiscourage local action by imposing bureaucratic conditions for access
Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future450to financial and other resources (Christoplos et al., 2009). Top-down
sustainability initiatives are often preoccupied with input metrics, such as
criteria for partner selection and justifications (often based on relativelydetailed quantitative analyses of such attributes as ‘additionality’),rather than on outcome metrics, such as whether the results make a
demonstrable contribution to sustainability (regarding metrics, seeNRC, 2005). 
To manage tradeoffs and conflicts in an open, efficient, and transparent
way, institutional and legal arrangements are extremely important. Theexisting literature on legislation for adaptation at the state level is notcomprehensive, but those countries studied lack many of the institutionalmechanisms and legal frameworks that are important for coordinationat the state level (Richardson et al., 2009). This has been found to be thecase for Vietnam, Laos, and China (Lin, 2009). In the South Pacific, highexposure to climate change risk has yet to translate into legislativeframeworks to support adaptation – with only Fiji, Papua New Guinea,and Western Samoa formulating national climate change regulatoryframeworks (Kwa, 2009). Without a supporting and implementednational legislative structure, achieving local disaster reduction andclimate change adaptation planning can be complicated (La Trobe andDavis, 2005; Pelling and Holloway, 2006; see also Section 6.4). Still,where local leadership is determined, skillful planning is possible, evenwithout legislation. This has been the experience of EthekwiniMunicipality (the local government responsible for the city of Durban,South Africa), which has developed a Municipal Climate ProtectionProgramme with a strong and early focus on adaptation without national-level policy or legal frameworks to guide adaptation planning at thelocal level (Roberts, 2008, 2010).
One way around the challenges of tradeoffs is to ‘bundle’ multiple
objectives through broader participation in strategy development andaction planning, both to identify multiple objectives and to encourageattention to mutual co-benefits. In this sense, both the pathway andoutcomes of development planning have scope to shape future socialcapacity and disaster risk management. Policies and actions to achievemultiple objectives include stakeholder participation, participatorygovernance (IRGC, 2009), capacity building,  and adaptive organizations,
including both private and public institutions where there is a considerableknowledge base reflecting both research and practice to use as a startingpoint (e.g., NRC, 2008). Multi-hazard risk management approachesprovide opportunities to reduce complex and compound hazards, bothin rural and urban contexts.
8.3. Integration of Short- and Long-Term
Responses to Extremes
When considering the linkages between disaster management, climate
change adaptation, and development, time scales play an important role.Disaster management increasingly emphasizes vulnerability reduction inaddition to the more traditional emergency response and relief measures.
This requires addressing underlying exposure and sensitivity in thecontext of hazards with different frequencies and return periods. As
discussed in Chapter 2, there is now a converging focus on vulnerabilityreduction in the context of disaster risk management and adaptation toclimate change (Sperling and Szekely, 2005).
Cross-scale (spatial and temporal) interactions between responses
focusing on the short term and those required for long-term adjustmentcan potentially create both synergies and contradictions among disasterrisk reduction, climate change adaptation, and development. This sectionassesses the literature regarding synergies and tradeoffs between short-and long-term adjustments. First, we consider the implications of pres ent-
day responses for future well-being. The barriers to reconciling short-and long-term goals are then assessed. Insights from research on theresilience of social-ecological systems are then considered as a potentialmeans of addressing integration in a long-term perspective. 
8.3.1. Implications of Present-Day Responses
for Future Well-Being 
The implications of present-day responses to both disaster risk and
climate change can be either positive or negative for human securityand well-being in the long term. Positive implications can includeincreased resilience, capacity building, broad social benefits fromextensive participation in risk management and resilience planning, andthe value of multi-hazard planning (see Sections 5.4 and 6.5). Negativeimplications can include threats to sustainability if the well-being offuture generations is not considered; issues related to the economicdiscounting of future benefits; ‘silo effects’ of optimizing responses forone system or sector without considering interaction effects with others(see Burby et al., 2001); equity issues regarding who benefits and whopays; and the ‘levee effect,’ where the adaptive solution to a current riskmanagement problem builds confidence that the problem has beensolved, blinding populations to the possibility that conditions maychange and make the present adaptation inadequate (Burby, 2006;Burby et al., 2006).
The terms ‘coping’ and ‘adaptation’ reflect strategies for adjustments to
changing climatic and environmental conditions. In the case of a set ofpolicy choices, both coping and adaptation denote forms of conductthat aim and indeed may achieve modifications in the ways in whichsociety relates to nature, and nature to society (Stehr and von Storch,2005). As discussed in Section 2.4, coping actions are those that takeplace when trying to alleviate the impacts or to live with the costs of aspecific event. They are usually found during the unfolding of disasterimpacts, which can continue for some time after an event – for example,if somebody loses their job or is traumatized. Coping strategies can helpto alleviate the immediate impact of a hazard, but may also increasevulnerabilities over the medium to longer term (Swift, 1989; Davies,1993; Sperling et al., 2008). The different time frames for coping andadaptation can present challenges for risk management. Focusing onshort-term responses and coping strategies can limit the scope foradaptation in the long term. For example, drought can force agriculturalistsChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future451to remove their children from school or delay medical treatment, which
may have immediate survival benefits, yet in aggregate undermines thehuman resources available for long-term adaptation (Norris, 2005;Alderman et al., 2006; Santos, 2007; Sperling et al., 2008).
In both developed and developing countries, a focus on coping with the
present is often fueled by the perception that climate change is a long-term issue and that other challenges, including economic growth, foodsecurity, water supply (Bradley et al., 2006), sanitation, education, andhealth care, require more immediate attention (Klein et al., 2005; Adlyand Ahmed, 2009; Kameri-Mbote and Kindiki, 2009). Particularly in poorrural contexts, short-term coping may be a tradeoff that increaseslonger-term risks (UNISDR, 2009; Brauch and Oswald Spring, 2011).Adaptation, on the other hand, is often focused on minimizing potentialrisk to future losses (Oliver-Smith, 2007). This ‘long-term’ framing ofadaptation can constrain both short-term coping and adaptive capacity,for example, when relocation of settlements to avoid coastal hazardsundermines social capital and local livelihoods, limiting household copingand adaptive capacity (Hunter, 2005). There is a large literature andmuch experience related to slum relocation that is of direct relevance tourban coping and adaptation (Gilbert and Ward, 1984; Davidson et al.,1993; Viratkapan and Perera, 2006). Context is important in discussingtradeoffs between addressing short- and long-term risks, and even in well-governed systems, political expediency will often distort the regulatoryprocess in a way that favors the short term (Platt, 1999).
Disasters can destroy assets and wipe out savings, and can push
households into ‘poverty traps,’ that is, situations where productivity isreduced, making it impossible for households to rebuild their savingsand assets (Zimmerman and Carter, 2003; Carter et al., 2007; Derconand Outes, 2009; López, 2009; van den Berg, 2010). The process by whicha series of events generates a vicious spiral of impacts, vulnerability,and risk was first recognized by Chambers (2006), who described it asthe ratchet effect of disaster, risk, and vulnerability. These micro-levelpoverty traps can also be created by health and social impacts of naturaldisasters: it has been shown that disasters can have long-lastingconsequences for psychological health (Norris, 2005), and for childdevelopment from reduction in schooling and diminished cognitive
abilities (see Alderman et al., 2006; Santos, 2007; Bartlett, 2008).
Where disaster loss is widespread, micro-level poverty traps can aggre gate
to the regional level. Here, poor regions impacted by disaster are unableto fully recover so that capacity is reduced and vulnerability heightened,making future disasters more likely. Without enough time to rebuild
between events, such regions may end up in a state of permanent
reconstruction, with resources devoted to repairing and replacing ratherthan accumulating infrastructure and equipment. This obstacle to capitalaccumulation and infrastructure development can lead to a permanent
disaster-related underdevelopment (Hallegatte et al., 2007; Hallegatteand Dumas, 2008). This can be amplified by other long-term mecha nisms,
such as changes in risk perception that reduce investments in the affectedregions or reduced services that make qualified workers leave theregion. These effects have been discussed by Benson and Clay (2004),and investigated by Noy (2009) and Hochrainer (2009), who found that
natural disasters have a negative impact on economic growth anddevelopment, especially when direct losses are large. This negativeimpact is found to be larger when the disaster affects a smaller country,with lower GDP per capita, weaker institutions, lower openness totrade, lower literacy rates, and lower levels of government spending,and when foreign aid and remittances are lower. Such effects have beenmodeled by Hallegatte et al. (2007) and Hallegatte and Dumas (2008)using a reduced-form economic model that shows that the average GDPimpact of natural disasters can be either close to zero if reconstructioncapacity is large enough, or very large if reconstruction capacity is too
limited, which may be the case in less-developed countries. There are,
however, many uncertainties in the ways in which people’s spontaneousand organized responses to increasing climate-related hazards feedback to influence long-term adaptive capacity and options. Migration,which can be traumatic for those involved, might lead to enhanced lifechances for the children of migrants, building long-term capacities andpotentially also contributing to the movement of populations awayfrom places exposed to risk (IOM, 2007, 2009a,b; Ahmed, 2009; OswaldSpring, 2009b; UNDP , 2009).
A broad literature on experiences of community-based and local-level
disaster risk reduction indicates options for transiting from short- tolonger-term responses, at least in the context of frequently occurringrisk manifestations (Lavell, 2009; UNISDR, 2009; Maskrey, 2011). Suchapproaches, many of which are based on community participation, haveprogressively moved from addressing disaster preparedness and capacitiesfor emergency management toward addressing the vulnerability oflivelihoods, the decline of ecosystems, the lack of social protection,unsafe housing, the improvement of governance, and other underlyingrisk factors (Bohle, 2009). While managing existing risk will contain loss,addressing underlying risk drivers will contribute to a reduction infuture risk to climate extremes.
8.3.2. Barriers to Reconciling Short- and Long-Term Goals
Although there is robust evidence in the literature to support disaster
risk reduction as a strategy for long-term climate change adaptation,there are numerous barriers to reconciling short- and long-term goals.Many poor countries are very vulnerable to natural hazards but cannotimplement the measures that could reduce this vulnerability for financialreasons, or due to a lack of governance capacity or technology. The recentnational self-assessments of progress toward achieving the UNISDRHyogo Framework for Action indicated that some least-developedcountries lack the human, institutional, technical, and financial capacitiesto address even emergency management concerns (UNISDR, 2009). Arecently developed index that measures capacities and conditions forrisk reduction shows that low- and lower-middle-income countries withweak governance have, with some exceptions, great difficulty addressingunderlying drivers of vulnerability. Those at the bottom of the index,such as Haiti, Chad, or Afghanistan, are also experiencing conflict orpolitical instability (UNISDR, 2011). Another obstacle to reconcilingChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future452short- and long-term goals is access to technology and maintenance of
infrastructure. An example is the introduction of water reuse technologies,which have been developed in a few countries, which could bring agreat improvement in the management of droughts if they could bedisseminated in many developing countries (Metcalf & Eddy, 2005). 
Money and technology are not enough to implement efficient disaster
risk reduction and adaptation strategies. Indeed, differences inresources cannot explain the differences in exposure and vulnerabilityamong regions (Nicholls et al., 2008). Governance capacities and theinadequacy of and lack of synergy between institutional and legislativearrangements for disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation,and poverty reduction are also as much a part of the problem as theshortage of resources. Institutional and legal environments and politicalwill are important, as illustrated by the difference in risk managementin various regions of the world (Pelling and Holloway, 2006). In manycountries disaster risk management and adaptation to climate changemeasures are overseen by different institutional structures (see Section1.1.3). This is explained by the historical evolution of both approaches.
Disaster risk management originated from humanitarian assistance
efforts, evolving from localized, specific response measures to preventivemeasures, which seek to address the broader environmental andsocioeconomic aspects of vulnerability that are responsible for turninga hazard into a disaster in terms of human and/or economic losses.Within countries, disaster risk management efforts are often coordinatedby civil defense agencies, while measures to adapt to climate changeare usually developed by environment ministries. Responding to climatechange was originally more of a top-down process, where advances inscientific research led to international policy discussions and frameworks.While the different institutional structures may represent an initialcoordination challenge, the converging focus on vulnerability reductionrepresents an opportunity for managing disaster and climate risks morecomprehensively within the development context (Sperling and Szekely,2005). A change in the culture of public administration toward creativepartnerships between national and local governments and empoweredcommunities has been found in some cases to dramatically reduce costs(Dodman et al., 2008). 
In addition to the barriers described above, there is also a tendency for
individuals and groups to focus on the short-run and to ignore low-
probability, high-impact events. The following studies discuss some of
the psychological and economic barriers shaping how people makedecisions under uncertainty:
•Underestimation of the risk: Even when individuals are aware of
the risks, they often underestimate the likelihood of the event
occurring (Smith and McCarty, 2006). This bias can be amplified by
natural variability (Pielke Jr. et al., 2008), where there is expert
disagreement, and where there is uncertainty. Magat et al. (1987),Camerer and Kunreuther (1989), and Hogarth and Kunreuther(1995), for example, provide considerable empirical evidence thatindividuals do not seek information on probabilities in making
their decisions. •Budget constraints : If there is a high upfront cost associated with
investing in adaptation measures, individuals will often focus onshort-run financial goals rather than on the potential long-termbenefits in the form of reduced risks (Kunreuther et al. ,1978;
Thaler, 1999).
•Difficulties in making tradeoffs : Individuals are also not skilled in
making tradeoffs between costs and benefits of these measures,which requires comparing the upfront costs of the measure withthe expected discounted benefits in the form of loss reduction overtime (Slovic, 1987).
•Procrastination : Individuals are observed to defer choosing
between ambiguous choices (Tversky and Shafir, 1992; Trope andLiberman, 2003).
•Samaritan’s dilemma : Anticipated availability of post-disaster
support can undermine self-reliance when there are no incentivesfor risk reduction (Burby et al., 1991).
•Politician’s dilemma : Time delays between public investment in
risk reduction and benefits when hazards are infrequent, and thepolitical invisibility of successful risk reduction can be pressures fora ‘not in my term of office’ attitude that leads to inaction (Michel-Kerjan, 2008).
Work in West and East Africa has shown that rural communities tend to
underestimate external forces that influence their region whileoverestimating their own response capacity (Enfors et al., 2008;Tschakert et al., 2010). Misjudging external drivers may be explained bythe low degree of control people feel they have over these drivers,resulting in reactions that range from powerlessness to denial. Anotherissue that makes it difficult to reconcile short- and long-term goalsarises from the challenges in projecting the long-term climate andcorresponding risks (see Section 3.2.3). Examples of this challenge arereflected in the demographic growth of Florida in the 1970s and 1980s,which unfolded during a period of low hurricane activity but mayexpose larger populations to the risks associated with extreme climateand weather events. Major engineering projects with long lead timesfrom planning to implementation have difficulty factoring in climatechange futures, and have instead been planned according to historichazard risk (Pielke Jr. et al., 2008). Managing natural risks and adaptingto climate change requires anticipating how natural hazards willchange over the next decades, but uncertainty about climate changeand natural variability is a significant obstacle to such anticipation(Reeder et al., 2009). 
Climate change is typically viewed as a slow-onset, multigenerational
problem. Consequently, individuals, governments, and businesses havebeen slow to invest in adaptation measures. Research in South Asia showsthat in those regions where past development had prioritized short- term
gains over long-term resilience, agricultural productivity is in declinebecause of drought and groundwater depletion, rural indebtedness isincreasing, and households are sliding into poverty with particularlyinsidious consequences for women, who face the brunt of nutritionaldeprivation as a result (Moench et al., 2003; Moench and Dixit, 2007).Connecting short- and long-term perspectives is thus seen as critical toChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future453realizing the synergies between disaster risk management and climate
change adaptation. 
8.3.3. Connecting Short- and Long-Term Actions
to Promote Resilience
The previous section has highlighted the importance of linking short-
and long-term responses so that disaster risk reduction and climatechange adaptation mutually support each other. A systems approachthat emphasizes cross-scale interactions can provide important insights on
how to realize synergies between disaster risk management and climate
change adaptation. Resilience, a concept fundamentally concerned withhow a system, community, or individual can deal with disturbance andsurprise, increasingly frames contemporary thinking about sustainablefutures in the context of climate change and disasters (Fol ke, 2006;
Walker and Salt, 2006; Brand and Jax, 2007; Bahadur et al., 2010). It hasdeveloped as a fusion of ideas from several bodies of literature: ecosystemstability (e.g., Holling, 1973; Gunderson, 2009), engineering robustinfrastructures (e.g., Tierney and Bruneau, 2007), the behavioral sciences(Norris, 2010), psychology (e.g., Lee et al., 2009), disaster risk reduction(e.g., Cutter et al., 2008), vulnerabilities to hazards (Moser, 2009), andurban and regional development (e.g., Simmie and Martin, 2010). In thecontext of this report, resilience refers to a system’s capacity to anticipateand reduce, cope with, and respond to and recover from externaldisruptions (see Sections 1.1.2.1 and 1.3.2). Resilience perspectives canbe used as an approach for understanding the dynamics of human-environmental systems and how they respond to a range of differentperturbations (Carpenter et al., 2001; Walker et al., 2004). 
‘Resilience thinking’ (Walker and Salt, 2006) may provide a useful
framework to understand the interactions between climate change andother challenges, and in reconciling and evaluating tradeoffs betweenshort- and longer-term goals in devising response strategies.Approaches that focus on resilience emphasize the need to manage forchange, to see change as an intrinsic part of any system, social orotherwise, and to ‘expect the unexpected.’ Resilience thinking goesbeyond the conventional engineering systems’ emphasis on capacity to
control and absorb external shocks in systems assumed to be stable (Folke,
2006). For social-ecological systems (examined as a set of interactions
between people and the ecosystems they depend on), resilienceinvolves three properties: the amount of change a system can undergo
and retain the same structure and functions; the degree to which it can
reorganize; and the degree to which it can build capacity to learn and
adapt (Fol ke, 2006). Resilience can also be considered a dynamic
process linked to human agency, as expressed in the ability to deal withhazards or disturbance, to engage with uncertainty and future changes,to adapt, cope, learn, and innovate, and to develop leadership capacity(Bohle et al., 2009; Obrist et al., 2010). 
Resilience approaches offer four key contributions for living with
extremes: first, in providing a holistic framework to evaluate hazards in
coupled social-ecological systems; second, in putting emphasis on thecapacities to deal with hazard or disturbance; third, in helping to explore
options for dealing with uncertainty and future changes; and fourth, inidentifying enabling factors to create proactive responses (Berkes, 2007;Obrist et al., 2010).The concept of resilience is already being applied asa guiding principle to disaster risk reduction and adaptation issues, aswell as to examine specific responses to climate change in differentdeveloped and developing country contexts (e.g., Cutter et al., 2008).Eakin and Webbe (2008) use a resilience framework to show that theinterplay between individual and collective adaptation can be related towider system sustainability. Goldstein (2009) uses resilience concepts tostrengthen communicative planning approaches to dealing with surprise.Linnenluecke and Griffiths (2010) use a resilience framework to exploreorganizational adaptation to climate change and weather extremes, andsuggest that organizations may need to develop multiple capabilitiesand response approaches in response to changing extremes. Nelson etal. (2007) have shown how resilience thinking can enhance analyses ofadaptation to climate change: as adaptive actions affect not only theintended beneficiaries but have repercussions for other regions andtimes, adaptation is part of a path-dependent trajectory of change.Resilience also considers a distinction between incremental adjustmentsand system transformation, which may broaden the expanse of adaptationand also provide space for agency (Nelson et al., 2007). Resilienceapproaches can be seen as complementary to agent-based analyses ofclimate change responses that emphasize processes of negotiation anddecisionmaking, as they can provide insights into the systems-wideimplications. Adger et al. (2011) show that dealing with specific riskswithout taking into account the nature of system resilience can lead toresponses that potentially undermine long-term resilience. 
Recent work on resilience and governance has focused on communication
of science between actors and depth of inclusiveness in decisionmakingas key determinants of the character of resilience. In support of theseapproaches it is argued that inclusive governance facilitates betterflexibility and provides additional benefit from the decentralization ofpower. On the down side, greater participation can lead to looseinstitutional arrangements that may be captured and distorted byexisting vested interests (Adger et al., 2005; Plummer and Armitage,
2007). Still, the balance of argument (and existing centrality of
institutional arrangements) calls for a greater emphasis to be placed on
the inclusion of local and lay voices and of diverse stakeholders in shaping
agendas for resilience through adaptation and adaptive management
(Nelson et al., 2007). Striking the right balance between top-down
command-and-control approaches, which offer stability over the short
term but reduced long-term resilience, and more flexible, adaptive forms
of risk management is the core practical challenge that disaster risk
management brings to climate change adaptation under conditions of
climatic extremes and projected increases in disaster risk and impacts
(Sperling and Szekely, 2005). 
Resilience thinking is not without its critiques (Nelson, 2009; Pelling,
2010a). Shortcomings include the downplaying of human agency insystems approaches and difficulty in including analysis of power inexplanations of change, which combine to effectively promote stabilityChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future454rather than flexibility, that is, maintaining the status quo and thus serving
particular interests rather than supporting adaptive management, sociallearning, or inclusive decisionmaking. One challenge to enhancingresilience of desired system states is to identify how responses to anysingle stressor influence the larger, interconnected social-ecologicalsystem, including the system’s ability to absorb perturbations or shocks,its ability to adapt to current and future changes, and its ability to learnand create new types or directions of change. Responses to one stressoralone may inadvertently undermine the capacity to address otherstressors, both in the present and future. For example, coastal towns ineastern England, experiencing worsening coastal erosion exacerbatedby sea level rise, are taking their own action against immediate erosionin order to protect livelihoods and homes, affecting sediments and ero sion
rates down the coast (Milligan et al., 2009). While such actions to protect
the coast are effective in the short term, in the long term, investing to‘hold the line’ may diminish capital resources for other adaptations andhence reduce adaptive capacity to future sea level rise. Thus, dealingwith specific risks without a full accounting of the nature of systemresilience can lead to responses that can potentially undermine long-term resilience. Despite an increasing emphasis on managing forresilience (Walker et al., 2002; Lebel et al., 2006), the resilience lensalone may not sufficiently illuminate how to enhance agency and movefrom the understanding of complex dynamics to transformationalaction.
8.4. Implications for Access to Resources,
Equity, and Sustainable Development
The previous section assessed the links between short- and long-term
responses to climate extremes. This section takes the idea of links further.It explores the relationships between climate change adaptation, disasterrisk management, and mitigation, and larger issues related to equity,access to resources, environmental and ecosystem protection, and relateddevelopment processes. This draws out the importance of governance indetermining the relationship between disaster risk and underlyingprocesses of unequal socioeconomic development and environmentalinjustices (Maskrey, 1994; Sacoby et al. ,2010). The section discusses
issues related to capacity and equity, the existence of winners and losers
from disaster and disaster management policy, and opportunities forcontributing to wider development goals including the enhancing of
human security. 
8.4.1. Capacities and Resources:
Availability and Limitations
The capacity to manage risks and adapt to change is unevenly distributed
within and across nations, regions, communities, and households
(Hewitt, 1983; Wisner et al., 2004; Beck, 2007). The literature on how
these capacities contribute to disaster risk management and climatechange adaptation emphasizes the role of economic, financial, social,
cultural, human, and natural capital, and of institutional context (seeSections 1.4 and 2.4). When the poor are impacted by disasters, limited
resources are quickly expended in coping actions that can furtherundermine household sustainability in the long run, reducing capitaland increasing hazard exposure or vulnerability. In these vicious cyclesof decline, households tend first to expend savings and then, if pressurescontinue, to withdraw members from non-productive activities such asschool, and finally to sell productive assets. As households begin tocollapse, individuals may be forced to migrate or in some cases enterinto culturally inappropriate, dangerous, or illegal livelihoods such asthe sex industry (Mgbako and Smith, 2010; Ferris, 2011). This povertyand vulnerability trap means that recovery to pre-disaster levels of well-being becomes increasingly difficult (Burton et al., 1993; Adger, 1996,Wisner et al., 2004; Chambers, 2006).
Children, the elderly, and women stand out as more vulnerable to
extreme climate and weather events. The vulnerability of children andtheir capacity to respond to climate change and disasters is discussed inBox 8-2 (see also Section 5.5.1 and Case Study 9.2.14). Among theelderly, increasing numbers will become exposed to climate changeimpacts in the coming decades, particularly in OECD countries wherepopulations are aging most rapidly. By 2050, it is estimated that one inthree people will be older than 60 years in OECD countries, as well as onein five at the global scale (UN, 2002). The elderly are made additionallyvulnerable to climate change-related hazards by characteristics that alsoincrease vulnerability to other social and environmental hazards (thuscompounding overall vulnerability): deterioration of health, personallifestyles, social isolation, poverty, and inadequate access to health andsocial infrastructures (OECD, 2006). Gender impacts vulnerability inmany ways. In the 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh, the death toll amongwomen was reportedly five times higher than among men (UNDP ,2007b). Cultural as well as physiological factors are widely cited for theover-representation of female deaths from flooding. Gender inequalityextends into female-headed households to compound the vulnerabilityof dependent children or elderly (Cannon, 2002; UNISDR, 2008; Oxfam,2010). Inequality has many other important faces: race, caste, religiousaffiliation, and physical disability, all of which help determine individualand household vulnerability, and they cross-cut gender and age effects.Importantly, the social construction of vulnerability through thesecharacteristics highlights the ways in which vulnerability changes overtime – in this case with changes in family structure and access toservices in response to economic cycles and political and cultural trendsevolving as the climate changes with potentially compounding effects(Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008).
Studies also show that female-headed households more often borrow
food and cash than rich and male-headed households during difficulttimes. This coping strategy is considered to be a dangerous one as thehouseholds concerned will have to return the food or cash soon afterharvests, leaving them more vulnerable as they have less food or cashto last them the season and to be prepared if disaster strikes (Young andJaspars, 1995). This may leave households in a cycle of poverty from oneseason to the next. Literature shows that this outcome is linked tounequal access by women to resources, land, and public and privatelyChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future455Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future
Box 8-2 | Children, Extremes, and Equity in a Changing Climate
The linkages between children and extreme events have been addressed through two principal lenses.
1. Differentiated Impacts and Vulnerability 
The literature estimates that 66.5 million children are affected annually by disasters (Penrose and Takaki, 2006). Research on disaster
impacts among children focuses on short- and long-term physical and psychological health impacts (Norris et al. ,2002; Bunyavanich et
al., 2003; del Ninno and Lindberg, 2005; Balaban, 2006; Waterson, 2006; Bartlett, 2008). Vulnerability to these impacts in part  is due to
the less-developed physical and mental state of children, and therefore differential capacities to cope with deprivation and st ress in
times of disaster (Cutter, 1995; Bartlett, 2008; Peek, 2008). 
Most literature points toward higher mortality and morbidity rates among children due to climate stresses and extreme events (C utter,
1995; Bunyavanich et al., 2003; Telford et al., 2006; Waterson, 2006; Bartlett, 2008; Costello et al., 2009). This is especiall y acute in
developing countries, where climate-sensitive health outcomes such as malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria are already common an d
coping capacities are lowest (Haines et al., 2006), although research in the United States found relatively low child mortality  from
disasters and considerable differences across age groups for different types of hazard (Zahran et al., 2008). 
Recent studies conducted in Bolivia, Indonesia, Mexico, Mozambique, Nepal, the Philippines, and Vietnam provide evidence of how
extensive (low impact/high frequency) disasters negatively affect children’s education, health, and access to services such as water and
sanitation, an issue of critical importance given the importance of primary education for human and long-term economic developm ent.
In areas in Bolivia that experienced the greatest incidence of extensive disasters, the gender gap in primary education achieve ment
widened, preschool enrollment rates decreased, and dropout rates increased. Equivalent areas in Nepal and Vietnam saw, respecti vely,
reduced primary enrollment rates and a drop in the total number of children in primary education. Extensive disasters also led to an
increased incidence of diarrhea in children under five years of age in Bolivia, an increased proportion of malnourished childre n under
three in Nepal, an increased infant mortality rate in Vietnam, and an increase in the incidence of babies born with low birth w eight in
Mozambique. This study also found evidence of negative impacts in terms of access to water and sanitation in Mexico and Vietnam(UNISDR, 2011). 
These studies underpin the need for resources for child protection during and after disaster events (Last, 1994; Jabry, 2003; B artlett,
2008; Lauten and Lietz, 2008; Weissbecker et al., 2008). These include protection from abuse, especially during displacement, s ocial safety
nets to guard against withdrawal from school due to domestic or livelihood duties, and dealing with psychological and physical health
issues (Norris et al., 2002; Keenan et al., 2004; Evans and Oehler-Stinnett, 2006; Waterson, 2006; Bartlett, 2008; Davies et al ., 2008;
Lauten and Lietz, 2008; Peek, 2008). 
2. Children’s Agency and Resource Access 
Rather than just vulnerable victims requiring protection, children also have a critical role to play in tackling extreme events  in the context
of climate change (Tanner, 2010). There is also increasing attention on child-centered approaches to preventing, preparing for,  coping
with, and adapting to extreme events (Peek, 2008; Tanner, 2010). 
While often centered on disaster preparedness and climate change programs in education and schools (Wisner, 2006; Bangay and Bl um,
2010), more recent work emphasizes the latent capacity of children to participate directly in disaster risk reduction or adapta tion sup ported
through child-centered programs (Back et al., 2009; Tanner et al., 2009). This emphasis acknowledges the unique risk perception s and
risk communication processes of children, and their capacity to act as agents of change before, during, andafter disaster events (see
collections of case studies in Peek, 2008; Back et al. , 2009; and Tanner, 2010). Examples demonstrate the ability to reduce risk behavior
at household and community scales, but also to mobilize adults and external policy actors to change wider determinants of risk and
vulnerability (Mitchell et al., 2008; Tanner et al., 2009).456provided services (Agarwal, 1991; Thomas-Slayter et al., 1995;
Nemarundwe, 2003; Njuki et al., 2008). But women are also often themajority holders of social capital and the mainstay of social movementsand local collective action, providing important mechanisms for householdand local risk reduction and potentially transformative resilience.Important here are local saving groups and microcredit/micro-financegroups, some of which extend to micro-insurance. In a review of micro-finance for disaster risk reduction and response in South Asia,Chakrabarti and Bhatt (2006) identify numerous initiatives, includingthose that build on extensive social networks and connect to the formalfinancial services sector.
Demographic and sociological diversity is also difficult to capture
in decisionmaking, where non-scientific knowledge is less easilyincorporated into formal decisionmaking. The importance of culture,including traditional knowledge, in shaping strategies for adaptation isrecognized (Heyd and Brooks, 2009; ISET, 2010). There is a long traditionof seeking to identify and bring such knowledge into planned disasterrisk management in urban and rural contexts through participatory andcommunity-based disaster risk management (Bruner et al., 2001;Fearnside, 2001; Pelling, 2007; Mercer et al., 2008) and tools such asparticipatory geographic information systems that explicitly seek tobring scientific and local knowledge together (Tran et al., 2009). Bothdevelopment planning and post-disaster recovery have tended toprioritize strategic economic sectors and infrastructure over locallivelihoods and poor communities (Maskrey, 1989, 1996). However, thisrepresents a missed opportunity for building local capacity and includinglocal visions for the future in planning the transition from reconstructionto development – opportunities that could increase long-termsustainability (Christoplos, 2006).
8.4.2. Local, National, and International
Winners and Losers 
While climate-related disasters cannot always be prevented, the scale of
loss and its social and geographical distribution do differ significantly,determined by the characteristics of those at risk and overarchingstructures of governance including the legacy of preceding development
paths for social institutions, economies, and physical assets (Oliver-Smith, 1994). But some people also benefit from disasters. These may be
organizations or individuals who benefit economically from reconstruc tion
or response (West and Lenze, 1994; Hallegatte, 2008b), through supplyingmaterials, equipment, and services – often at a premium price generatedby local scarcity and inflationary pressures (Benson and Clay, 2004) oras a result of poorly managed tendering processes (Klein, 2007). Areasnot impacted by disaster can also experience economic benefits, forexample, in the Caribbean where hurricanes have caused international
tourist flows to be redirected (Pelling and Uitto, 2001). Political actors
can also benefit by demonstrating strong post-disaster leadership, attimes even when past political decisions have contributed to generatingdisaster risk (Olson and Gawronski, 2003; Le Billon and Waizenegger,2007; Gaillard et al., 2008). The same can be said for climate change,with very unequal consequences in various regions of the world and
various economic sectors and social categories (Adger et al., 2003;O’Brien et al., 2004; Tol et al., 2004). Less directly, those who havebenefited from policies and processes, such as expansion of commercialagriculture or logging, can also be described as benefiting from decisions
that have generated vulnerability and prefigured disaster for others.Such costs and benefits are often separated geographically andtemporally, making any efforts at distributional equity challenging. Forexample, in the case of Hurricane Mitch, which killed more than 10,000people and caused as much as US$ 8.5 billion in damages, deforestationand rapid urban growth are often cited among the key causes of thedisaster-related losses (Alves, 2002; Pielke Jr. et al., 2003), with thosebenefiting from such development including distant speculators. 
Analyses of winners and losers associated with climate change and
discrete hazards need differentiation. In almost every circumstance,what one part of society views as a win can be viewed by another partas a loss. In examining possible responses to risks of climate extremes,it is essential to recognize that possible impacts interact with vestedinterests of different locations, sectors, and population groups in verydifferent ways. In virtually every case, the question is: benefits forwhom? Who says that this course of action is best for society as awhole? What compensation is offered for those who are losers? Inparticular, who is listening to views of those parts of society that haveless political power and influence?
While individual events can be assessed as a snapshot of winners and
losers, climate change as an ongoing process has no final state. Overtime, it may produce different distributions of winners and losers, forexample, as areas experience positive and then negative consequencesof changes in temperature or precipitation. Whether or not a particularplace produces winners or losers from an extreme event or a combinationof climate extremes and other driving forces also depends on perceptions.These may be shaped by the recovery process, but are strongly influencedby prioritized values (Quarantelli, 1984, 1995; O’Brien, 2009; O’Brienand Wolf, 2010). In considering winners and losers from extreme climateand weather events, and also from the outcomes of policies directed atreducing disaster risk or responding to climate change, it is thus vital torecognize the subjective understanding of winners and losers.
Much depends upon an individual, group, or society’s dominant values,
perspectives, and access to information. While some regard winners andlosers as a natural and inevitable outcome of ecological changes and/oreconomic development, others suggest that winners and losers aredeliberately generated by unequal political and social conditions(O’Brien and Leichenko, 2003; Wisner, 2003). Lurking behind discoursesabout winners and losers are issues of liability and compensation forlosses: that is, if a population or an area experiences severe losses due toan extreme event (at least partly) attributed to climate change, can faultbe prescribed? Does responsibility lie with those who have generatedlocal environmental change through settling a hazard-exposed area,those who have promoted or permitted such settlement, or those whohave failed to mitigate local hazard or global environmental change?Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future457Issues of equity, justice, and compensation are emerging in climate
change adaptation, but few have begun to deal with questions of liabilityfor disaster risk production beyond the local scale (Kent, 2001; Mitchell,2001; Wisner, 2001; O’Brien et al., 2010b). It seems that efforts to assignresponsibility will emerge as an issue for both governments and courtsat a range of scales (Farber, 2007). 
8.4.3. Potential Implications for Human Security
Changes in extreme climate and weather events threaten human secu rity,
and both disaster risk management and climate change adaptationrepresent strategies that can improve human security while also avoidingdisasters. Human security addresses the combined but related challenges
of upholding human rights, meeting basic human needs, and reducing
social and environmental vulnerability (UNDP , 1994; Sen, 2003; Bogardiand Brauch, 2005; Brauch 2005a,b, 2009; Fuentes and Brauch, 2009). Italso emphasizes equity, ethics, and reflexivity in decisionmaking and acritical questioning and contestation of the drivers of climate change(O’Brien et al., 2010b) and local impacts (Pelling, 2010a). Human securityis realized through the capacity of individuals and communities to respondto threats to their environmental, social, and human rights (GECHS, 2000;
Barnett et al., 2010). A number of studies have assessed the relationshipbetween climate change and human security, demonstrating that thelinkages are often both complex and context-dependent (Barnett, 2003;Barnett and Adger, 2007; Brauch et al., 2008, 2009, 2011; Buhaug et al.,2008; O’Brien et al., 2010a). Among the most likely human securitythreats are impacts felt through damage to health, food, water, or soilconditions (Oswald Spring, 2009a, 2011b). 
Among the most widely discussed humanitarian and human security
issues related to climate change are the possibilities of increased migrationand/or violent conflict resulting from the biophysical or ecologicaldisruptions associated with climate change (Reuveny, 2007; O’Brien etal., 2008; Raleigh et al., 2008; Warner et al., 2010). There are indicationsthat migration conditions followed disasters in the distant past, as wellas in current situations (see, e.g., Le Roy Ladurie, 1971; Kinzig et al.,2006; Peeples et al., 2006). Migration is a key coping mechanism forpoor rural households, not only in extreme circumstances (e.g., during a
prolonged drought, as with the 20th-century US Dustbowl period andSahelian droughts) but also as a means of diversifying and increasing
income (Harrington et al., 2009; Oswald Spring, 2011a; Scheffran, 2011).The opportunities that population movement opens for risk reduction areseen in international remittance flows from richer to poorer countries.
These are estimated to have exceeded US$ 318 billion in 2007, of whichdeveloping countries received US$ 240 billion (World Bank, 2008).
Disasters linked to extreme events often lead to forced displacement of
people, as well as provoke voluntary migration among the less poor. The
relationship between climate risk and displacement is a complex one
and there are numerous factors that affect migration (UNDP , 2009).Nonetheless, recent research suggests that adverse environmentalimpacts associated with climate change have the potential to triggerdisplacement of an increased number of people (Kolmannskog, 2008;
Feng et al., 2010). Studies suggest that most migration will take placeinternally within individual countries; that in most cases when climaticextremes occur in developing countries they will not lead to net out-migration because people tend to return to re-establish their lives aftera disaster; and that while long-term environmental changes may causemore permanent migration this will also tend to be internal (Piguet,2008; UNDP , 2009). More negatively, forced land abandonment isstressful for migrants whose culture and sense of identity are affected(Mortreux and Barnett, 2009; Brauch and Oswald Spring, 2011). Thesocial dislocation provoked by migration can lead to a breakdown intraditional rural institutions and associated coping mechanisms, forexample, in the erosion of traditional community-based water managementcommittees in central and west Asia (Birkenholtz, 2008). Local collectivecoping and adaptive capacity can also be limited by increases in thenumber of female-headed households as men migrate (Oswald Spring,1991, 2009a).
Attention has been mainly focused on population displacement associ ated
with large disasters. Pakistan’s 2010 floods have to date left an estimated6 million people in need of shelter; India’s 2008 floods also uprootedroughly 6 million people; Hurricane Katrina displaced more than half amillion people in the United States; and Cyclone Nargis uprooted800,000 people in Myanmar and South Asia. However, the compoundeffect of smaller, more frequent events can also contribute to displacement.Hazards such as floods, although often causing relatively low mortality,destroy many houses and hence cause considerable displacement.Between 1970 and 2009 in Colombia, for example, 24 disaster lossreports detailed floods that killed fewer than 10 people but destroyedmore than 500 houses. In total, around 26,500 houses were destroyed,potentially displacing more than 130,000 people. In the Indian state ofOrissa, 265 floods with similar low mortality rates destroyed more thanhalf a million houses. It is estimated that such extensive disastersaccount for an additional 19% displacement of people who are typicallyless visible than those displaced in larger events that attract internationalmedia and humanitarian assistance (UNISDR, 2011).
Despite the opportunities to enhance development, disaster response is
often better at meeting basic needs than securing or extending humanrights. Indeed, the political neutrality that underpins the humanitarianimperative makes any overt actions to promote human rights byhumanitarian actors difficult. In this way, disaster response andreconstruction can to only a partial extent claim to enhance humansecurity (Pelling and Dill, 2009). Work at the boundaries betweenhumanitarian and development actors, new partnerships, the involvementof government, and meaningful local participation are all emerging as waysto resolve this challenge. One successful case has been the reconstructionprocess in Aceh, Indonesia, following the Indian Ocean tsunami, wherecollaboration between government and local political interests facilitatedby international humanitarian actions on the ground and through political-level peace-building efforts have increased rights locally, containedarmed conflict, and provided an economic recovery plan (Le Billon andWaizenegger, 2007; Gaillard et al., 2008; Törnquist et al., 2010).
Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future458Coping with the new and unprecedented threats to human security
posed by climate change has raised questions about whether existinggeopolitics and geo-strategies have become obsolete (Dalby, 2009). Theconcepts, strategies, policies, and measures of the geopolitical and strategictoolkits of the past as well as the short-term interests dominatingresponses to climate change have been increasingly questioned, whilethe potential for unprecedented disasters has led to a consideration ofthe security implications of climate change (UNSC, 2007; EU, 2008;UNGA, 2009; UNSG, 2009). Concerns range from increased needs forhumanitarian assistance to concerns over environmental migration,emergent diseases for humans or in food chains, potentials for conflictbetween nations or localities over resources, and potential for political/governmental destabilization due to climate-related stresses incombination with other stresses, along with efforts to assign blame(Ahmed 2009; Brauch and Oswald Spring, 2011). 
Climate change is generally regarded to act as a threat multiplier for
instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world (CNACorporation, 2007). Even in stable polities, adaptation planning thatseeks long-term resilience is confronted by political instability directlyafter disasters (Drury and Olson, 1998; Olson, 2000; UNDP , 2004; Pellingand Dill, 2009). When disasters strike across national boundaries orwithin areas of conflict, they can provide a space for rapprochement,but effects are usually short-lived unless the underlying political andsocial conditions are addressed (Kelman and Koukis, 2000; Kelman,2003). New interest in disaster and climate change as a security concernhas brought in lessons from international law (Ammer et al., 2010) andsecurity policy (Campbell et al., 2007) on planning for relatively low-probability, high-consequence futures. Although during times of stress itis easy for polities to drift toward militarization and authoritarianism formanaging disaster risk (Albala-Bertrand, 1993), there are alternatives,such as inclusive governance, that can meet the goals of sustainabledevelopment and human security over the long term (Olson andGawronski, 2003; Brauch, 2009; Pelling and Dill, 2009; Bauer, 2011). 
8.4.4. Implications for Achieving
Relevant International Goals
Addressing –or failing to address –disaster risk reduction and climate
change adaptation can influence the success of international goals,
particularly those linked to development. Successive reports have noted
the potential for climate change to derail the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). In 2003, the Asian Development Bank and nine other
development organizations first highlighted that climate change mayimpact on progress toward the MDGs and in particular constrainprogress beyond 2015, underlying the importance of managing climaterisks within and across development sectors. The UK Department forInternational Development (DFID, 2004, 2006) and UNDP (2004) showhow each of the MDGs is dependent on some aspect of disaster risk forsuccess. Disaster impacts on the MDG targets are both direct andindirect. For example, MDG 1 (to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger)
is impacted directly by damage to productive and reproductive assets ofthe poor and less poor (who may remain in poverty or slip into
poverty as a result of disaster loss), and indirectly affected by negativemacroeconomic impacts. The 2007 UN Human Development Report notedthat enhanced adaptation is required to protect the poor, with climatechange potentially acting as a brake on development beyond 2015. 
The UNISDR Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the
Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA) explicitlyrecognizes that climate variability and change are important contributorsto disaster risk and includes strong support for better linking disastermanagement and climate change adaptation efforts (Sperling andSzekely, 2005; see also Section 7.3.1). The HFA priorities for action haveproven foresightful in including resilience explicitly as a component.Priority Three calls for “knowledge, innovation and education to build aculture of safety and resilience at all level s.” This provides a strong
justification for international actors to support investment in institutionaland human capacity for national and local resilience building, and onethat does not require the addition of new international agreements tostart work. Frameworks for such action exist, for example, in CommonCountry Assessments, United Nations Development AssistanceFrameworks, National Adaptation Plans of Action, and Poverty ReductionStrategies, but limited progress has been made on this to date (DFID,2004). Some have proposed integrating climate change and disasterrisk management into any equivalent of the MDGs post-2015 (Tribe andLafon, 2009; Gostin et al., 2011).
8.5. Interactions among Disaster Risk
Management, Adaptation to ClimateChange Extremes, and Mitigation ofGreenhouse Gas Emissions
8.5.1. Thresholds and Tipping Points
as Limits to Resilience
Recent literature suggests that climate change could trigger large-scale,
system-level regime shifts that could significantly alter climatic andsocioeconomic conditions (MEA, 2005; Lenton et al., 2008; Hallegatte etal., 2010; see Section 3.1.7). Examples of potential system changes includedieback of the Amazon rainforest, decay of the Greenland ice sheet, andchanges in the Indian summer monsoon (Lenton et al., 2008). At smallerscales, also, climate change is exacerbating well-established examplesof environmental regime shifts, such as freshwater eutrophication(Carpenter, 2003), shifts to algae-dominated coral reefs (Hughes et al.,2003), and woody encroachment of savannas (Midgley and Bond,2001). The abruptness and persistence of such changes in social andecological systems, coupled with the fact that they can be difficult andsometimes impossible to reverse, means that they can have substantialimpacts on human well-being (Scheffer et al., 2001; MEA, 2005; Scheffer,2009). The notion of regimes shifting once thresholds or tipping pointsare crossed contrasts with discussions of climate thresholds (see Section3.1.1) and traditional thinking about gradual, linear, and more predictablechanges in ecological and social-ecological systems, and emphasizesChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future459the possibility of multiple futures determined by the crossing of critical
thresholds (Levin, 1998; Gunderson and Holling, 2002). Similar discussionon socioeconomic systems has, for example, identified profitability limitsin economic activities as critical thresholds that can bring about suddencollapse and regime change (Schlenker and Roberts, 2006; OECD, 2007). 
The metaphor of tipping points, or points at which a system shifts from
one state to another, can also be applied to disaster events. Disastersthemselves are threshold-breaching events, where coping capacities ofcommunities are overwhelmed (e.g., Blaikie et al., 1994; Sperling et al.,2008). Disasters may lead to secondary hazards, for example, when theimpacts from one disaster breach the coping capacities of related sys tems,
as when hurricane impacts trigger landslides or when different disastersproduce concatenated impacts over time (Biggs et al., 2011). For example,losses associated with droughts and fires during the 1997/1998 El Niño-Southern Oscillation event in Central America increased landslide andflood hazard during Hurricane Mitch in 1998 (Villagrán de León, 2011).Critical social thresholds may be crossed as disaster impacts spreadacross society. Disaster response is as much about containing such lossesas assisting those hurt by the initial disaster impact. 
For the poor, life and health are immediately at risk; for those living in
societies that take measures to protect infrastructure and economic andphysical assets, the lives and health of the population are less at risk.However, a threshold can be crossed when hazards exceed anticipatedlimits, are novel or unexpected in a specific risk management domain(Beniston, 2004; Schär et al., 2004; Salagnac, 2007), or when vulnerabilityhas increased or resilience decreased due to spillover from market andother shocks (Wisner, 2003).
In 2010, for example, western Russia experienced the hottest summer
since the beginning of systematic weather data recording 130 yearsago. Lack of rainfall in early 2010 and July temperatures almost 8°Cabove the long-term average led to parched fields, forests, and peatlands
that posed a high wildfire risk. During and after the wildfires, Russia’smortality rate increased by 18%. In August alone, 41,300 more peopledied as compared to August 2009, due to both the extreme heat andsmoke pollution. Social and economic change had greatly increased the
risk posed by wildfires. Traditional agricultural livelihoods have declined,accompanied by out-migration and reduced management of surroundingforests, arguably exacerbated by the decentralization of nationalmanagement and increased exploitation by the private sector (UNISDR,
2011). 
The recognition of nonlinearity and the importance of thresholds as
limiting points for existing systems has led climate scientists to increase
their attention to the ‘tails’ of impact probability density functions(Weitzman, 2009). This is in contrast to the disasters research commu nity,
which, after focusing on major extremes, is now recognizing the
importance of small or local disasters and the secondary disasters thatmake up concatenated events (UNDP , 2004; UNISDR, 2009). Both lensesare valuable for a comprehensive understanding of the interaction of
disaster impact with development.Tipping points in natural and human systems are more likely to arise
with relatively severe and/or rapid climate change than with moderatelevels and rates (Wilbanks et al., 2007). Because of this, less success withclimate change mitigation implies greater challenges for adaptation anddisaster risk management. Not only does adaptation need to considerincremental change in hazard and vulnerability, but the possibility ofthreshold breaching, systems-wide changes. The nonlinear changesassociated with breaching thresholds may exceed adaptation capacityto avoid serious disruptions. Examples of ecological system changes of thiskind and social impacts include the disappearance of glaciers currentlyfeeding urban and agricultural water supply (Orlove, 2009), effects ofclimate change on traditional livelihoods for the sustainability ofindigenous cultures (Turner and Clifton, 2009), widespread loss of coralsin acidifying oceans and fisher livelihoods (Reaser et al., 2000), andprofitability limits for important economic activities like agriculture,fisheries, and tourism. When socioeconomic systems are already understress (e.g., fisheries in many countries), sustainability thresholds may bemore easily passed. Responses to potential thresholds or tipping pointsinclude efforts to improve the information available to decisionmakers,for example, through monitoring systems to provide early warning of animpending system collapse (Biggs et al., 2009; Scheffer et al., 2009),but also initiatives researching the balance of risks associated withgeoengineering (Royal Society, 2009) aiming to avoid such tippingpoints (Virgoe, 2002; Kiehl, 2006). 
8.5.2. Adaptation, Mitigation, and
Disaster Risk Management Interactions
As indicated above, the extent to which future adaptation and disaster
risk reduction action will be required is likely to be dependent on theextent and rapidity with which climate change mitigation actions maybe taken and resulting risk unfolds for any given development context.This section assesses the ways in which mitigation, disaster risk reduc tion,
and adaptation interact with development in urban and rural contexts.
In many instances, climate change mitigation and adaptation may be
synergistic, such as land use planning to reduce transport-related energyconsumption and limit exposure to floods, or building codes to reduceheating energy consumption and enhance robustness to heat waves(McEvoy et al., 2006). There is an emerging literature exploring thelinkages between climate change mitigation and adaptation, and thepossibility of approaches that address both objectives simultaneously(Wilbanks and Sathaye, 2007; Hallegatte, 2009; Bizikova et al., 2010;Wilbanks, 2010; Yohe and Leichen ko, 2010). In this section we enlarge
the scope of the interactions to include disaster risk management. Thisbuilds on experience within the disaster management community thathas recently sought to integrate risk modeling (UNDP , 2004; UNISDR,2009, 2011) and planning to consider multi-hazard contexts. An impor tant
lesson from this is that avoiding superficial integration means seekingout and addressing shared root causes of exposure and vulnerability tohazards, and not just addressing the surface expressions of risk (Wisner,2011). The extent of adaptation required will depend on the climateChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future460change mitigation efforts undertaken, and it is possible that these
requirements could increase drastically if levels of climate change exceedsystemic thresholds – whether in geophysical or socioeconomic systems. 
Practical integration of climate change mitigation and adaption into a
development context is complicated because of a differential distributionin costs and benefits (e.g., mitigation benefits are distributed andaccrue globally; adaptation benefits, like disaster risk management, areoften easier to measure locally). In addition, the research and policydiscourses of these three policy domains are quite separated and inareas technically unrelated, and the constituencies and decisionmakersare often different (Wilbanks et al., 2007). In many cases, the challengeof bringing the entire range of issues and options into focus – seekingsynergies and avoiding conflicts – is most likely to occur in discussionsof climate change responses and development objectives in particularplaces: localities and small regions where compliance with national orinternational mitigation agendas provides a logic for local action(Wilbanks, 2003). The following subsections present the urban and ruralcontexts as examples.
8.5.2.1. Urban
In an increasingly urbanized world, global sustainability in the contextof a changing climate will depend on achieving sustainable and climate-
resilient cities. Urban spatial form is critical for energy consumption,emission patterns, and disaster risk management (Desplat et al., 2009),and it influences where and how residents live and the modes of trans port
that they use. Urban planning is a tool that can be used to pursue climatechange mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction as part of theeveryday development process (Newman and Kenworthy, 1989; Bentoet al., 2005; Handy et al., 2005; Ewing and Rong, 2008; Grazi et al.,2008; Brownstone and Golob, 2009; Glaeser and Kahn, 2010). Urbanform also influences the spatial and social inequalities that largely shapevulnerability, coping, and adaptive capacity (Pelling, 2003; Gusdorfet al., 2008; Leichenko and Solecki, 2008). The historical failure ofurban planning in most developing country cities has had tremendousenvironmental and social consequences (UN-HABITAT, 2009; World Bank,2010a). Also in richer countries, where planning is not comprehensive,
maladaptation can take place rather than synergistic risk reduction, for
example, where urban heat wave risk management results in increased
private air conditioning without decarbonized energy available (Lindley etal., 2006). Similarly, a denser city may reduce greenhouse gas emissions
but increase heat wave vulnerability (Hamin and Gurran, 2009).However, since urban forms influence both greenhouse gas emissions
and vulnerability (McEvoy et al., 2006), scope for synergistic planningand action can also be found. For example, managing car use maycontribute to decreased greenhouse gas emissions, but also lower localparticulate pollution and reduce the health impacts of urban heat waves(Dennekamp and Carey, 2010).
As yet there is only limited evidence that opportunities for synergistic
planning offered by urbanization are being realized, especially for thosemost marginalized and vulnerable. More typically, urbanization
compounds environmental problems. As countries urbanize, the risksassociated with economic asset loss tend to increase through rapidgrowth in infrastructure and productive and social assets, while mortalityrisk tends to decrease (Birkmann, 2006). As cities grow, they also modifythe surrounding rural environment, and consequently may generate asignificant proportion of the hazard to which they are also exposed. Forexample, as areas of hinterland are paved over, runoff increases duringstorms, greatly magnifying flood hazards (Mitchell, 1999; Pelling, 1999).As mangroves are destroyed in coastal cities, storm-surge hazard canincrease (Hardoy et al., 2001). Likewise, within urban areas (thoughoften beyond the reach of urban planning), the expansion of informalsettlements can lead to increased local population exposure to landslideand flood hazards (Satterthwaite, 1997; UNDP , 2004). Global riskmodels indicate that expansion of urban risk is primarily due to rapidlyincreasing exposure, which outpaces improvements in capacity toreduce vulnerability (such as through improvements legislating andapplying building standards and land use planning), at least in rapidlygrowing low- and middle-income nations (UNISDR, 2009, 2011). Asa consequence, risk is becoming increasingly urbanized (Mitchell,1999; Pelling, 2003; Leichenko and O’Brien, 2008). There are dramaticdifferences, nonetheless, between developed and developing countries.In most developed countries (and increasingly in a number of cities inmiddle-income countries, e.g., Bogota, Mexico City), risk-reducingcapacities exist that can manage increases in exposure. In contrast, inmuch of the developing world (and particularly in the poorest least-developed countries where large proportions of the urban population livein unplanned settlements) such capacities are greatly restricted, whilepopulation growth drives exposure. Financial and technical constraintsmatter for risk management, but differences in wealth alone do notexplain differences in risk reduction investments, which also depend onrisk perceptions and political choice (e.g., Satterthwaite, 1998; Hardoyet al., 2001; Hanson et al., 2011).
Urban planning can be a vehicle for synergy, but it takes time to produce
significant effects. Synergy in planning requires anticipation of futureclimate change, taking into account how climate will change over manydecades, the uncertainty of this information, the vulnerability of urbansystems, and the capacity of social agents. The Asian Cities ClimateChange Resilience Network found that catalyzing city-level actors toassess these plans are essential, rather than depending on externalexperts or national agencies to prepare urban plans (Tyler et al., 2010).Built forms are difficult to change because they exhibit strong inertiaand irreversibility: when a low-density city is created, transforming itinto a high-density city is a long, expensive, and difficult process(Gusdorf et al., 2008). This point is crucial in the world’s most rapidlygrowing cities, where urban forms of the future are being decided basedon actions taken in the present, and where current trends indicate thatlow-density, automobile-dependent forms of suburban settlement arerapidly expanding (Solecki and Leichen ko, 2006). Some work has started
to investigate these aspects of climate change adaptation and mitigation(Newman et al., 1996). At the same time, there are specific opportunitieswhen cities enter periods of large-scale transformation. This is happening
Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future461in Delhi, Mumbai, and other cities in India as private capital redevelops
low-income city neighborhoods into commercial districts and middle-and high-income housing areas with associated low-income housing.There is rare scope here to promote disaster risk reduction, climate changeadaptation, and mitigation alongside existing demands for marketprofitability and social justice in urban and building design. There arealso growing numbers of large-scale slum/informal settlement upgradingprograms that aim to improve housing and living conditions for low-income households (Boonyabancha, 2005; Satterthwaite, 2010).
Disaster reconstruction also creates opportunities for synergistic
development planning. For example, reconstruction after the 2005Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans, Louisiana, included rebuildingto Green Building Council ‘Leadership in Energy and EnvironmentalDesign’ (LEED) standards (USGBC, 2010). Similarly, in May 2007,Greensburg, Kansas, was virtually destroyed by a tornado and LEEDstandards have been applied (Harrington, 2010). Echoing the tradeoffsbetween speed and sustainability presented in Section 8.2.5, the actionsin Greensburg have also slowed rebuilding of the town, leading in thisinstance to an erosion in community and associated aspects ofresilience in the short run, while attempting to create a model ‘green’community in the long run.
In short, despite the many opportunities for building synergy into urban
development planning and practice, examples of success are not plentiful.Lack of synergy is more the norm, to take just one example of urbanizationin central Dhaka, Bangladesh. These flood-prone areas had until recentlybeen occupied by natural water bodies and drains, vital to the regulationof floods. The Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan restricts developmentin many of these areas, but despite the Plan, infilling continues withboth private- and public-sector projects. Destruction of retention pondsand drains increases risks of flooding and building in the drainedwetlands generates new risks of liquefaction following earthquakes(UNISDR, 2011).
8.5.2.2. Rural
Rural areas are the primary site for climate change mitigation. Rural areashave considerable experience in disaster risk management and morerecently in climate change adaptation (UNDP , 2007b). Nonetheless, as
for urban areas, the evidence base is limited for consciously synergistic
development projects and policies that consider climate change
mitigation, adaptation, and disaster management together. There are,however, several important opportunities where climate change mitiga tion
and adaptation or risk management have shown scope for integrationand opportunities are being explored, for example in agroforestry(Verchot et al., 2007).
Any scope for synergy needs to be seen within the context of contemporary
development pressures (Goklany, 2007). For small farms in particular,pressures are strong for diversification into non-farm activities, where suchopportunities exist, but strong support is needed to enable transitionsin economic activity (Roshetko et al., 2007). Climate change affects the
range of choices available, for example, in low-lying coastal zoneswhere saltwater intrusion and coastal flooding are already makingtraditional agriculture marginal and leading to the adoption of saltwatertolerant crops or a shift from agriculture to aquaculture (Adger, 2000).While urban areas have expanded in size and influence, the majority ofthe poor continue to reside in rural areas in many countries, particularlyin Africa, and are among the most resource-scare and capacity-limitedpopulation groups (UNDP , 2009). For populations that may also beisolated from markets and communication networks, even small increasesin the frequency or severity of hazard can cause local livelihoods tocollapse, though recent developments in communication technology maybridge this gap (Aker and Mbiti, 2010). Where political and economicsystems disrupt food distribution and market functioning, vulnerabilityto food insecurity escalates (Misselhorn, 2005). 
Hard choices also have to be made between expanding rural populations
or economies and natural capital. Too often, local natural assets areexploited not by local actors to build local capacities but by externalagents, such that resources are extracted with little benefit accruinglocally. The balance and implementation of controls on natural resourceexploitation is both a potential damper on current capacity building anda critical mechanism for ensuring long-term sustainability of rurallivelihoods and ecosystem services (Chouvy and Laniel, 2007). Non-farmincome now represents a substantial proportion of total income formany rural households and can, in turn, increase resilience to weather-and climate-related shocks (Brklacich et al., 1997; Smithers and Smit,1997; Wandel and Smit, 2000). The implications of these transitions forlocal rural risk, and how far they may provide scope for mitigation, hasnot been fully explored in the literature. 
While urban sites offer opportunities for mitigation through diversified
(household) production and energy conservation, rural areas are a focusfor concentrated low- or no-carbon energy production ranging fromhydroelectric power (HEP) to solar and wind farms, biofuel crops, andcarbon sink functions associated with forestry in particular and REDD+projects. These investments can have significant local impacts on disasterrisk through changes in land use and land cover that may influencehydrology, or through economic effects and consequences for livelihoods.
There is scope for synergy, for example, through small HEP/flood orwater conservation dams, and some have gone as far to say that thisjoined-up approach is part of a transformed development policy formeeting combined energy and water demands in vulnerable ruralcommunities, most particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (Foster and Briceño-Garmendia, 2011). Some impacts can even go beyond local places.Recent impacts of biofuel production on rural livelihoods and globalfood security indicate the interdependence of vulnerability in rural andurban systems, and the care required in transformations of this kindwhere impacts can quickly spread and be amplified through globalmarkets (Dufey, 2006; de Fraiture et al., 2008).
Flows of investment, remittances, migration, and material transfers
through trade and also in the movement of resources (water, food,Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future462waste, and energy) intimately connect rural and urban economies and
societies, and the local with the global, such that the sustainability ofone will influence the other. The existence of multiple, intersectingstressors in rural and urban contexts draws attention to the importanceof addressing the underlying drivers of risk as a means of both disasterrisk management and adaptation, and of promoting climate changemitigation. 
8.6. Options for Proactive, Long-Term
Resilience to Future Climate Extremes 
Considering the broad challenges described previously, it is important
to assess the range of existing planning tools and the ways they areused, who uses them, and how they interact or change over time.Pursuing sustainable and resilient development pathways requiresintegrated and ambitious policy that is science-based and knowledge-driven, and that is capable of addressing issues of heterogeneity andscale. The latter issues are particularly vexing, as the consequences of,and responses to, extreme climate and weather events are local, butthese responses need to be supported and enabled by actions at regional,national, and global scales.
This section first considers the challenges of planning for the future,
then assesses the literature pertaining to tools and practices that canhelp address these issues. As the preceding sections in this chapter andother chapters in the report have argued, achieving a sustainable andresilient future draws attention to the need for both incremental andtransformational changes. Based on an assessment of the literature, thefinal section discusses why such changes may involve a combination ofadaptive management, learning, innovation, and leadership. 
8.6.1. Planning for the Future
Disaster risk management and climate change adaptation arefundamentally about planning for an uncertain future, a process thatinvolves combining one’s own aspirations (individual and collective)with perspectives on what is to come (Stevenson, 2008). Planning for
the future is challenging when the stakes are high, values disputed,and decisions urgent, and these factors often create tensions among
different visions of development. Typically, decisionmakers (representing
households, local or national governments, international institutions,
etc.) look to the future partly by remembering the past (e.g., projectionsof the near future are often derived from recent experiences with extremeevents) and partly by projecting how the future might be different
(using forecasts, scenarios, visioning processes, or story lines – either
formal or informal) (Miller, 2007). Projections further into the future are
necessarily shrouded in larger uncertainties. The most commonapproach for addressing these uncertainties is to develop multiplevisions of the future (quantitative scenarios or narrative storylines), thatin early years can be compared with actual directions of change(Boulanger et al., 2006a,b; Moss et al., 2010). Scenario development has become an established research tool both in
the natural sciences (e.g., Nakicenovic et al., 2000; Lobell et al., 2008)and in the social sciences (e.g., Wack, 1985; Davis, 1998; Robinson,2003; Galer, 2004; Kahane, 2004; Rosegrant et al., 2011). Scenarios canbe based on different spatial (e.g., global, national, and local) andtemporal scales (e.g., from a few years to several decades or centuries).The challenges for integrated disaster risk management and climate
change adaptation scenarios are to generate climate data that can be
downscaled to at least regional and sub-national scales, while extendingdisaster risk projections to longer time scales (see Gaffin et al., 2004;Theobald, 2005; Bengtsson et al., 2006; van Vuuren et al., 2006; Grübleret al., 2007; Moss et al., 2010; Hallegatte et al., 2011a). 
Scenario development has traditionally been carried out in a sequential
manner (Moss et al., 2010). For example, a first step in developing climate
change scenarios has typically involved structural projections of keydeterminants of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., population changes,urbanization, etc.). These have been used to estimate concentrationsand radiative forcing from emissions, leading to climate projections thatcan be used in impacts research. One difficulty in using climate scenariosfor disaster risk management and climate change adaptation has beenthe uncertainties associated with extreme climate and weather events,including the behavior of local climates (see Section 3.2.3). Futuresocioeconomic changes (e.g., demography, population preferences,technologies) are also highly uncertain, thus scenarios must consider awide range of possible futures to design adaptation strategies andanalyze tradeoffs (e.g., Hall, 2007; Lempert, 2007; Lempert and Collins,2007; WGBU, 2008; Dessai et al., 2009a,b; Hallegatte, 2009). Alternativeapproaches have focused first on scenarios of radiative forcing, followedby an analysis of the combinations of economic, technological,demographic, policy, and institutional factors that can influence suchtrajectories (Moss et al., 2010). Other approaches are based on robustdecisionmaking (e.g., Groves and Lempert, 2007; Lempert and Collins,2007; Groves et al., 2008); information gap analysis (Hine and Hall,2010); or on the search for co-benefits, no regrets strategies, flexibility,and reversibility (e.g., Fankhauser et al., 1999; Goodess et al., 2007;Hallegatte, 2009). 
Scenario development requires substantial climate, social, environmental,
and economic data, which are not equally available or accessible for allparts of the world. Qualitative scenarios can also be produced based onexpert judgment (e.g., Delphi exercises) or on storylines designed throughconsultative processes. Such scenarios often reflect different mindsetsor worldviews that represent contrasting visions of the future.
To adapt to changing climate and weather extremes, difficult choices
may become increasingly necessary. In many locations, for example,adapting to scenarios of reduced water availability may involveincreased investments in water infrastructure to provide enoughirrigation to maintain existing agricultural production, or a shift fromcurrent production to less water-consuming crops (see Rosenzweig etal., 2004; ONERC, 2009; Gao and Hu, 2011). In considering adaptationto future flood risk in the Thames Estuary, the UK Environment AgencyChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future463(2009) applied four scenarios over three time periods to flood
management. Through a wide consultation process, it was determinedthat improving the current infrastructure continues to be the preferredstrategy until 2070, when construction of an outer barrage may becomejustifiable, especially as economic and climate change conditionschange over time.
Evaluating choices among different options depends on how the
stakeholders view the region in coming decades, and on adaptationdecisions that are informed by political processes. One scenarioapproach that explicitly acknowledges both social and environmentaluncertainties entails identification of flexible adaptation pathways formanaging the future risks associated with climate change (Yohe andLeichenko, 2010). Based on principles of risk management (whichemphasize the importance of diversification and risk-spreadingmechanisms in order to improve social and/or private welfare in situa tions
of profound uncertainty), this approach can be used to identify asequence of adaptation strategies that are designed to keep society ator below acceptable levels of risk. These strategies, which policymakers,stakeholders, and experts develop and implement, are expected toevolve over time as knowledge of climate change and associated climatehazards progresses. The flexible adaptation or adaptive managementapproach that underpins this also stresses the connections betweenadaptation and mitigation of climate change, recognizing that climatechange mitigation will be needed in order to sustain society at or belowan acceptable level of risk (Yohe and Leichen ko, 2010).
In contrast to predictive scenarios and risk management approaches,
exploratory and normative approaches can be used to develop scenariosthat represent desirable alternative futures. This is particularly importantin the case of sustainability, where the most likely futures may not bethe most desirable (Robinson, 2003), and where poverty, inequity, andinjustice are recognized by many as incompatible with sustainabledevelopment (Redclift 1987, 1992; St. Clair, 2010). Pathways thatrequire considerable transformation to reach sustainable futures of thiskind can be supported by backcasting techniques. The process ofbackcasting involves developing normative scenarios that explore thefeasibility and implications of achieving certain desired outcomes
(Robinson, 2003; Carlsson-Kanyama et al., 2008). It is concerned withhow desirable futures can be attained, focusing on policy measures that
would be required to reach such conditions. Participatory backcasting,which involves local stakeholders in visionary activities related to
sustainable development, can also open deliberative opportunities and
inclusiveness in decision framing and making. Where visioning isrepeated it can also open possibilities for tracking development and
learning processes that make up adaptive strategies for disaster riskmanagement, based on the explicit acknowledgement of the beliefs,
values, and preferences of citizens (Robinson, 2003). Changing attitudes
and core beliefs, including those on climate change, its causes, and
consequences, is a slow process (Volkery and Ribeiro, 2009). 
Adding an anticipatory dimension to planning for the future is critical
for striving toward transformational actions in the face of multiple anddynamic uncertainties. The literature on anticipatory action learning
provides some experience on what this might look like (Stevenson,2002; Kelleher, 2005). The framing and negotiation of decisionmakingand policy is made inclusive and reflexive through multiple rounds ofstakeholder engagement to explore meanings of what different futuresmay involve, reflect upon unavoidable tradeoffs and the winners andlosers, and establish confidence to creatively adapt to new challenges(Inayatullah, 2006). This type of learning stresses the skills, knowledge,and visions of those at risk and aims to support leadership from eventhe most vulnerable. A combination of local- and global-scale scenariosthat link storylines developed at several organizational levels (Biggs et
al., 2007), personalizing narratives to create a sense of ownership
(Frittaion et al., 2010), and providing safe and repeated learning spaces(Kesby, 2005) can enhance learning. 
While scenarios, projections, and forecasts are all useful and important
inputs for planning, actual planning and decisionmaking is a complexsocio-political process involving different stakeholders and interactingagents. Although much progress has been made by employing scenariobuilding and narrative creation to explore uncertainties, surprises,extreme events, and tipping points, the transition from envisioning toplanning, policymaking, and implementation remains poorly understood(Lempert, 2007). Similarly, more widespread uptake of even scientificallyhighly robust scenarios may be hampered by conflicting understandingsof and practical approaches to uncertainty, different scalar needs, andlack of training among users (Gawith et al., 2009). Experiences inscenario building emphasize their usefulness for raising awareness onclimate change (Gawith et al., 2009). However, to move from framingpublic debates to policymaking and implementation, useful scenariobuilding requires procedural stability, permanent yet flexible institutionaland governance structures that build trust, and experience to takeadvantage of new insights for effective and fair risk management(Volkery and Ribeiro, 2009). 
Developing the capacity for adaptive learning to accommodate
complexity and uncertainty requires exploratory and imaginative visionsfor the future that support choices and can accommodate multiple valuesand aspirations (Miller, 2007). Disaster risk management and climatechange adaptation, and synergies between the two, can contributetoward planning for a sustainable and resilient future, but this involvesexpanding the diversity of futures that are considered and identifyingthose that are desirable, as well as the short- and long-term values andactions that are consistent with them (Lempert, 2007).
8.6.2. Approaches, Tools, and Integrating Practices
As discussed above, scenarios, narrative storylines (Tschakert and Dietrich,2010) and simulations (Nicholls et al., 2007) can help to project andfacilitate discussion of possible futures. This section considers the toolsthat are available for helping decisionmakers and planners think aboutand plan for the future in the context of extreme climate and weatherevents. Past experiences with enhancing resilience to climate extremesChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future464include examples of both specific decision support tools and the
governance and institutional contexts in which these tools are used andsubsequent decisions are made (OECD, 2009b; Burch et al., 2010;Whitehead et al., 2010). Tools include those that enable informationgathering, monitoring, analysis, and assessment; simulate threats;develop projections of possible impacts; and explore implications forresponse. Effective approaches combine understandings of potentialstresses from climate extremes, along with possible tipping points foraffected social and physical systems, with monitoring systems for trackingchanges and identifying emerging threats in time for adaptive responses.This is, of course, challenging, requiring methodologies that can be opento both quantitative and qualitative data and their analysis, includingparticipatory deliberation (NRC, 2010). 
Institutional innovations aimed at improving the availability of disaster
information to decisionmakers include the creation of national orregional institutions to manage and distribute disaster risk information(von Hesse et al., 2008; Corfee-Morlot et al., 2011), bringing togetherpreviously fragmented efforts centered in national meteorological,geological, oceanographic, and other agencies. The World MeteorologicalOrganization and partner organizations have proposed the creation ofa Global Framework for Climate Services, a collaborative effort to helpthe global community to better adapt to climate variability and changeby developing and incorporating science-based climate information andprediction into planning, policy, and practice (WCC-3, 2009). New open-source tools for comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment are begin ning
to offer ways of compiling information at different scales and fromdifferent institutions (OECD, 2009b). A growing number of countries arealso systematically recording disaster loss and impacts at the local level(DesInventar, 2010) and developing mechanisms to use such informationto inform and guide public investment decisions (Comunidad Andina,2007, 2009; von Hesse et al., 2008) and national planning. Unfortunately,there is as yet only limited experience with the integrated deploymentof such tools and institutional approaches, especially in ways that crossscales of risk management strategy development and decisionmaking,and very limited evaluations of such deployment. 
8.6.2.1. Improving Analysis and Modeling Tools
Various tools can be used to design environmental and climate policies.Among them, integrated environment-energy-economy models produce
long-term projections taking into account demographic, technological,
and economic trends (e.g., Edenhofer et al., 2006; Clarke and Weyant,
2009). These models can be used to assess the consequences of variouspolicies. However, most such models are at spatial and temporal scalesthat do not resolve specific climate extremes or disasters (Hallegatte et
al., 2007). At higher spatial resolution, numerical models (e.g., input-
output models, calculable general equilibrium models) can help to
assess disaster consequences and, therefore, balance the cost of disasterrisk management actions and their benefits (Rose et al., 1997; Gordonet al., 1998; Okuyama, 2004; Rose and Liao, 2005; Tsuchiya et al., 2007;Hallegatte, 2008b). In particular, they can compare the cost of respondingto disasters with the cost of preventing disasters. Since disasters have
intangible consequences (e.g., loss of lives, ecosystem losses, culturalheritage losses, distributional consequences) that are difficult to measurein economic terms, the quantitative models are necessary but not suffi cient
to determine desirable policies and disaster risk management actions.
Whether incorporated in models or used in other forms of analysis, CBA
is useful to compare costs and benefits; but when intangibles play alarge role and when no consensus can be reached on how to value theseintangibles, other decisionmaking tools and approaches are needed.Multi-criteria decisionmaking (Birkmann, 2006), robust decisionmaking(e.g., Lempert 2007; Lempert and Collins, 2007), transition managementapproaches (e.g., Kemp et al., 2007; Loorbach, 2010), and group-processanalytic-deliberative approaches (Mercer et al., 2008) are examples ofsuch alternative decisionmaking methodologies.
Also necessary are indicators to measure the successes and failures of
policies. For example, climate change adaptation policies often targetthe enhancement of adaptive capacity. The effects and outcomes ofpolicies are often measured using classical economic indicators such asGDP . The limits of such indicators are well known, and have beensummarized in several recent reports (e.g., CMEPSP , 2009; OECD,2009a). To measure progress toward a resilient and sustainable future,one needs to include additional components, such as measures ofstocks, other capital types (natural capital , human capital, social capital),
distribution issues, and welfare factors (health, education, etc.). Manyalternative indicators have been proposed in the literature, but noconsensus exists. Examples of these alternative indicators include theHuman Development Index, the Genuine Progress Indicator, the Index ofSustainable Economic Welfare, the Ecological Footprint, the normalizedGDP , and various indicators of vulnerability and adaptive capacity(Costanza, 2000; Yohe and Tol, 2002; Lawn, 2003; Costanza et al., 2004;Eriksen and Kelly, 2006; Jones and Klenow, 2010).
8.6.2.2. Institutional Approaches
Among the most successful disaster risk management and adaptationefforts have been those that have facilitated the development ofpartnerships between local leaders and other stakeholders, includingextra-local governments (Bicknell et al, 2009; Pelling and Wisner, 2009;Gero et al, 2011). This allows local strength and priorities to surface indisaster risk management, while acknowledging also that communities(including local government) have limited resources and strategic scopeand alone cannot always address the underlying drivers of risk(Bhattamishra and Barrett, 2010). Local programs are now increasinglymoving from a focus on strengthening disaster preparedness andresponse to reducing both local hazard levels and vulnerability (e.g.,through slope stabilization, flood control measures, improvements indrainage, etc.) (Lavell, 2009; UNISDR, 2009; Reyos, 2010). Most of thecases where sustainable local processes have emerged are wherenational governments have decentralized both responsibilities andresources to the local level, and where local governments have becomemore accountable to their citizens, as for example in cities in ColombiaChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future465such as Manizales (Velásquez, 1998, 2005). In Bangladesh and Cuba,
successes in disaster preparedness and response leading to drasticreduction in mortality due to tropical cyclones, built on solid localorganization, have relied on sustained support from the national level(Haque and Blair, 1992; Bern et al., 1993; Ahmed et al., 1999;Chowdhury, 2002; Kossin et al., 2007; Elsner et al., 2008; Karim andMimura, 2008; Knutson et al., 2010; World Bank, 2010b). A growingnumber of examples now exist of community-driven approaches that aresupported by local and national governments as well as by internationalagencies, through mechanisms such as social funds (Bhattamishra andBarrett, 2010). 
Risk transfer instruments, such as insurance, reinsurance, insurance
pools, catastrophe bonds, micro-insurance, and other mechanisms, shifteconomic risk from one party to another and thus provide compensationin exchange for a payment, often a premium (ex-post effect) (seeSections 5.6.3, 6.5.3, and 7.4, and Case Study 9.2.13). In addition, thesemechanisms can also help to anticipate and reduce (economic) risk asthey reduce volatility and increase economic resilience at the household,
national, and regional levels (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005). As oneexample, with such insurance, drought-exposed farmers in Malawi havebeen able to access improved seeds for higher yielding and higher riskcrops, thus helping them to make a leap ahead in terms of generatinghigher incomes and the adoption of higher return technologies (WorldBank, 2005; Hazell and Hess, 2010). However, many obstacles to suchschemes still exist, particularly in low-income and many middle-incomecountries, including the absence of comprehensive risk assessments andrequired data, legal frameworks, and the necessary infrastructure, andprobably more experience is required to determine the contexts inwhich they can be effective (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2007;Cummins and Mahul, 2009; Mahul and Stutley, 2010).
Disaster risk management and adaptation can also be addressed
through the enhancement of generic adaptive capacity alongside hazard-
specific response strategies (IFRC, 2010). This capacity includes accessto information, the skills and resources needed to reflect upon and applynew knowledge, and institutions to support inclusive decisionmaking.These are cornerstones of both sustainability and resilience. While
uncertainty may make it difficult for decisionmakers to commit funds for
hazard-specific risk reduction actions, these barriers do not prevent
investment in generic foundations of resilient and sustainable societies
(Pelling, 2010a). Importantly, from such foundations, local actors maybe able to make better-informed choices on how to manage risk in their
own lives, certainly over the short and medium terms. For instance,
federations formed by slum dwellers have become active in identifying and
acting on disaster risk within their settlements and seeking partnerships
with local governments to make this more effective and larger scale
(IFRC, 2010).
Changes in systems and structures may call for new ways of thinking
about social contracts, which describe the balance of rights and
responsibilities between different parties. Social contracts that are
suitable for technical problems can be limiting and insufficient foraddressing adaptive challenges (Heifetz, 2010). Pelling and Dill (2009)
describe the ways that current social contracts are tested when disastersoccur, and how disasters may open up a space for social transformation,or catalyze transformative pathways building on pre-disaster trajecto ries.
O’Brien et al. (2009) consider how resilience thinking can contribute tonew debates about social contracts in a changing climate, drawingattention to tradeoffs among social groups and ecosystems, and to therights of and responsibilities toward distant others and future generations. 
8.6.2.3. Transformational Strategies and Actions
for Achieving Multiple Objectives 
If extreme climate and weather events increase significantly in coming
decades, climate change adaptation and disaster risk management arelikely to require not only incremental changes, but also transformative
changes in systems and institutions. Transformation can be defined as afundamental qualitative change, or a change in composition or structurethat is often associated with changes in perspectives or initial conditions
(see Box 8-1). It often involves a change in paradigm and may includeshifts in perception and meaning, changes in underlying norms andvalues, reconfiguration of social networks and patterns of interaction,changes in power structures, and the introduction of new institutionalarrangements and regulatory frameworks (Folke et al., 2009, 2010;Pahl-Wostl, 2009; Smith and Stirling, 2010). 
Although transformational policies and measures may be deliberately
invoked as a strategy to reduce disaster risk and adapt to climate change,in many cases such strategies are precipitated by an extreme event,sometimes referred to as a ‘focusing event’ (Birkland, 1996). However,whether an extreme event leads to any change at all is unclear, asprocesses of policy change are often subtle and complex and linked tolearning processes (Birkland, 2006). Exploring the relationship betweensystematic learning processes and small disasters, Voss and Wagner(2010) find that a failure to learn is the most common prerequisite forfuture disasters. There are, however, many dimensions to learning (e.g.,cognitive, normative, and relational; see Huitema et al., 2010), andlearning may be a necessary but insufficient condition for initiatingtransformational change.
Understanding processes of deliberate change and change management
can provide insights on societal responses to extreme climate andweather events. Traditional approaches to managing change successfullyin businesses and organizations focus on a series of defined steps(Harvard Business Essentials, 2003). Kotter (1996), for example, identifiesan eight-step process for promoting change: (1) create a sense of urgency;(2) pull together the guiding team; (3) develop the change vision andstrategy; (4) communicate for understanding and buy in; (5) empowerothers to act; (6) produce short-term wins; (7) don’t let up; and (8)create a new culture. Kotter (1995) also identifies eight errors that areoften made when leading change, including, for example, allowing toomuch complacency, failing to create a sufficiently powerful guidingcoalition, and underestimating the power of a sound vision. It is alsoChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future466important to recognize that many change initiatives create uncertainty
and disequilibria, and are considered disruptive or disorienting (Heifetzet al., 2009). Furthermor e, vested interests seldom choose transforma tion,
particularly when there is much to lose from change (Christensen, 1997).As discussed in Section 8.5.2, there are winners and losers not only fromextreme climate and weather events, but also from responses.Consequently, fundamental change is often resisted by the people that itaffects the most (Kotter, 1996; Kegan and Lahey, 2009). Helping people,groups, organizations, and governments to manage the resultingdisequilibria is seen as essential to successful transformation. 
Many of the recent approaches to change and transformation focus on
learning organizations, and the importance of changing individual andcollective mindsets or mental models (Senge, 1990; Heifetz et al., 2009;Kegan and Lahey, 2009; Scharmer, 2009). This transformational change
literature distinguishes between technical problems that can beaddressed through management based on existing organizational and
institutional structures and cultural norms, and adaptive challenges that
require a change in mindsets, including changes in assumptions, beliefs,
priorities, and loyalties (Heifetz et al., 2009; Kegan and Lahey, 2009).
Treating disaster risk management and climate change adaptation as
technical problems may focus attention only on improving technologies,
reforming institutions, or managing displaced populations, whereasviewing them as an adaptive challenge shifts attention toward gapsbetween values and behaviors (e.g., values that promote human securityversus policies or behaviors that undermine health and livelihoods),
beliefs (e.g., a belief that disasters are inevitable or that adaptation will
occur autonomously), and competing commitments (e.g., a commitment
to maintaining aid dependency or preserving social hierarchies).Although most problems have both technical and adaptive elements,
treating an adaptive challenge only as a technical problem limitssuccessful outcomes (Heifetz et al., 2009). 
Transformative changes that move society towards the path of
openness and adaptability depend not only on changes in mindsets, butalso on changes in systems and structures. Case studies of social-ecological systems suggest that there are three phases involved in sys tems
transformations. The first phase includes being prepared, or preparingthe system, for change. The second phase calls for navigating thetransition by making use of a sudden crisis as an opportunity forchange, whether the crisis is real or perceived. The third phase involvesbuilding resilience of the new system (Olsson et al., 2004; Chapin et al.,2010). Traditional management approaches emphasize the reduction ofuncertainties, with the expectation that this will lead to systems thatcan be predicted and controlled. However, in the case of climate change,future projections of climate variables and extremes will containuncertainty (see Section 3.2.3). Consequently, there is a need formanagement approaches that are adaptive and robust in the presenceof large and irreducible uncertainties. 
8.6.3. Facilitating Transformational Change
Adapting to climate and weather extremes associated with rapid and
severe climate change, such as a warming beyond 4°C within this
century, without transformational policy and social change will be
difficult: if not chosen through proactive policies, forced transformations
and crises are likely to result (New et al., 2011). Adaptation that isChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future
FAQ 8.2 | Are transformational changes desirable and even possible, and if so, who will lead them?
Transformation in and of itself is not always desirable. It is a complex process that involves changes at the personal, cultura l, institutional,
and systems levels. Transformation can imply the loss of the familiar, which can create a sense of disequilibrium and uncertain ty. In
some cases, notable changes in the nature, form, or appearance of a system or process may be inconsistent with the values and p references
of some groups. Transformation can thus be perceived as threatening by some and instrumental by others, as the potential for re al or
perceived winners and losers at different scales stimulates social unease or tension. Desirable or not, it is important to reco gnize that
transformations are now occurring at an unprecedented rate and scale, influenced by globalization, social and technological dev elopment,
and environmental change. Climate change itself represents a system-scale transformation that will have widespread consequences  for
ecology and society, including through changes in climate extremes. Responses to climate change and changes in disaster risk ca n be
both incremental and transformational. Transformational responses are not always radical or monumental – sometimes they simplyinvolve a questioning of assumptions or viewing a problem from a new perspective. Transformational responses are not only possi ble,
but they can be facilitated through learning processes, especially reflexive learning that explores blind spots in current thin king and
approaches to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. However, because there are risks and barriers, transforma tion
also calls for leadership – not only from authority figures who hold positions and power, but from individuals and groups who a re able
to connect present-day actions with their values, and with a collective vision for a sustainable and resilient future. Consider ing the
balance between incremental and transformative adjustments flags the importance of scale: first, because of the opportunities f or
enhancing leadership capacity that come from greater involvement of those locally at risk or undertaking adaptive experimentati on for
risk management; and second, because of the potential for transformation, incremental change, or stability at one systems level  or sector
(e.g., administrative, social, technical) to provoke or restrict adjustments in other systems and scales. Inter-scale and inter -sectoral
communication therefore become important tools for managing adaptive disaster risk management.467transformative marks a shift from emphasizing finite projects with linear
trajectories and readily identifiable, discrete strategies and outcomes(Schipper, 2007) toward an approach that includes adaptive manage ment,
learning, innovation, and leadership, among other elements. These
aspects of adjustment are increasingly seen as being embedded inongoing socio-cultural and institutional learning processes. This can be
observed in the many adaptation projects that emphasize learning aboutrisks, evaluating response options, experimenting with and rectifyingoptions, exchanging information, and making tradeoffs based on publicvalues using reversible and adjustable strategies (McGray et al., 2007;Leary et al., 2008; Hallegatte, 2009; Hallegatte et al., 2011b). 
Transformational adaptations are likely to be enabled by a number of
factors. Some of the factors arise from external drivers such as focalevents that catalyze attention to vulnerabilities or the presence of othersources of stress that also encourage considerations of major changes.Supportive social contexts such as the availability of understandableand socially acceptable options, access to resources for action, and thepresence of incentives may also be important. Other factors are relatedto effective institutions and organizations, including those described inthe following subsections.
8.6.3.1. Adaptive Management
In general terms, adaptive management can be defined as a structuredprocess for improving management policies and practices by systemiclearning from the outcomes of implemented strategies, and by takinginto account changes in external factors in a proactive manner (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007; Pahl-Wostl, 2009; Section 6.6.2). Principles of adaptivemanagement can contribute to a more process-oriented approach todisaster risk management, and have already shown some success inpromoting sustainable natural resource management under conditionsof uncertainty (Medema et al., 2008). Adaptive management is oftenassociated with ‘adaptive’ organizations that are not locked into rigidagendas and practices, such that they can consider new information, newchallenges, and new ways of operating (Berkhout et al., 2006; Pelling etal., 2007). Organizations that can monitor environmental, economic,
and social conditions and changes, respond to shifting policies and
leadership changes, and take advantage of opportunities for innovative
interventions are a key to resilience, especially with respect to conceivablebut long-term and/or relatively low-probability events. Those socialsystems that appear most adept at adapting are able to integrate formal
organizational roles with cross-cutting informal social spaces for learning,
experimentation, communication, and for trust-based and speedy disasterresponse that is nonetheless accountable to beneficiaries (Pelling et al.,
2007).
Adaptive management is a challenge for those organizations that
perceive reputational risk from experimentation and the knowledge
that some local experiments may fail (Fernandez-Gimenez et al., 2008).
Where this approach works best, outcomes have gone beyond specific
management goals to include trust-building among stakeholders –aresource that is fundamental to any policy environment facing an
uncertain future, and which also has benefits for quality of life andmarket competitiveness (Fernandez-Gimenez et al., 2008). It requiresrevisiting the relationship between the state and local actors concerningfacilitation of innovation, particularly when experiments go wrong.Investing in experimentation and innovation necessarily requires sometolerance for projects that may not be productive or cost effective, or atleast not in the short term or under existing risk conditions. However, itis exactly the existence of this diversity of outcomes that mak es societies
fit to adapt once risk conditions change, particularly in unexpected andnonlinear directions. 
8.6.3.2. Learning
The dynamic notion of adaptation calls for learning as an iterativeprocess in order to build resilience and enhance adaptive capacity now,rather than targeting adaptation in the distant future (see Section 1.4.2).Social and collective learning includes support for joint problem solving,power sharing, and iterative reflection (Berkes, 2009). The need to takeinto account the arrival of new information in the design of responsestrategies has also been mentioned for mitigation policies (Ha Duong etal., 1997; Ambrosi et al., 2003). Adaptive management is an incrementaland iterative learning-by-doing process, whereby participants make senseof system changes, engage in actions, and finally reflect on changes andactions. Lessons from learning theories, including experiential learning(Kolb, 1984) and transformative learning (Mezirow, 1995), stress theimportance of learning-by-doing in concrete learning cycles, problem-solving actions, and the reinterpretation of meanings and valuesassociated with learning activities.
Learning is a key component for living with uncertainty and extreme
events, and is nurtured by building the right kind of social/institutionalspace for learning and experimentation that allows for competingworldviews, knowledge systems, and values, and facilitates innovativeand creative adaptation (Thomas and Twyman, 2005; Armitage et al.,2008; Moser, 2009; Pettengell, 2010). Examples include promotingshared platforms for dialogs and participatory vulnerability assessmentsthat include a wide range of stakeholders (see ISET, 2010). It is equallyimportant to acknowledge that abrupt and surprising changes maysurpass existing skills and memory (Batterbury, 2008). Adaptation projectshave demonstrated that fostering adaptive capacity and managinguncertainty in real-time, by adjusting as new information, techniques, orconditions emerge, especially among populations exposed to multiplerisks and stressors, is more effective than more narrowly designedplanning approaches that target a given impact and are dependent onparticular future climate information (McGray et al., 2007; Pettengell,2010). In the humanitarian sector, institutionalized processes of learninghave contributed to leadership innovation (see Box 8-3).
Action research and learning provide a powerful complement to
resilience thinking, as they focus explicitly on iterative or cyclicallearning through reflection of successes and failures in experimentalChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future468action, transfer of knowledge between learning cycles, and the next
learning loop that will lead to new types of action (List, 2006; Ramos,2006). Referring to the learning processes described in Section 1.4.2,critical reflection is paramount to triple-loop learning; it also constitutesthe key pillar of double-loop learning, or the questioning of what worksand why that is fundamental to shifts in reasoning and behavior (Kolband Fry, 1975; Argyris and Schön, 1978; Keen et al., 2005). Allowing timefor reflection in this iterative learning process is important because itprovides the necessary space to develop and test theories and strategiesunder ever-changing conditions. It is through such learning processesthat individual and collective empowerment can emerge and potentiallybe scaled up to trigger transformation (Kesby, 2005). 
8.6.3.3. Innovation
The transformation of society toward sustainability and resilienceinvolves both social innovations and technological innovations –incremental as well as radical. Innovation can refer to non-material
changes related to knowledge, cognition, communication, or intelli gence,
or it can refer to any kind of material resources. In some cases, small
adjustments in practices or technologies may represent innovative steps
toward sustainability, while in other cases there is a strong need for more
radical transformations. Some of the literature on innovation focuses on
ensuring economic competitiveness for firms in an increasingly
globalized economy (Fløysand and Jakobsen, 2010), and some
concentrates on the relationship between environment on the one hand
and the competitiveness of firms on the other (Mol and Sonnenfeld,
2000). In addition, there is a body of social science literature on innova tion
that has emerged during the last 15 years, motivated by the need fortransforming society as a whole in more sustainable directions. Recent
literature has brought out new ideas and frameworks for understanding
and managing technology and innovation-driven transitions, such asthe Multi Level Perspective (MLP) (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2002;
Geels and Schot, 2007; Markard and Truffer, 2008). Combining insightsfrom evolutionary theory and sociology of technology, MLP conceptual izes
major transformative change as the product of interrelated processesoccurring at the three levels of niches, regimes, and landscape. The modelemphasizes the incremental nature of innovation in socio-technicalregimes. Transitions – that is, shifts from one stable socio-technicalregime to another – occur when regimes are destabilized throughlandscape pressures, which provide breakthrough opportunities forniche innovations. 
In this field of research, there is a strong focus on systems innovation
and transformation of socio-technical systems, with the potential offacilitating transitions from established systems for transport, energysupply, agriculture, housing, etc., to alternative, sustainable systems(Geels, 2002; Hoogma et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2005; Raven et al., 2010).The systems innovation literature analyzes the emergence and dynamicsof large-scale, long-term socio-technical transformations (Kemp et al.,1998).
Though not directly dependent on changes in technology, technological
and social innovations are often closely interrelated, not the least inthat they involve changes in social practices, institutions, cultural values,knowledge systems, and technologies (Rohracher, 2008). Box 8-4describes such innovation in water management. A central, basic insightestablished within this research is that social and technological changeis an interactive process of co-development between technology andsociety (Kemp, 1994; Hoogma et al., 2002; Rohracher, 2008). Throughouthistory, new socio-technical systems have emerged and replaced old onesin so-called technological revolutions, and an important characteristic ofsuch transitions is the interactions and conflicts between new, emergingsystems and established and dominating socio-technical regimes, withstrong actors defending business as usual (Kemp, 1994; Perez, 2002).Chapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future
Box 8-3 | Institutionalized Research and Learning in the Humanitarian Sector
An important attribute of the humanitarian sector is its readiness to learn. Research and learning unfolds at multiple levels, including
sector-wide reviews of performance and practice such as those undertaken by the Active Learning Network for Accountability andPerformance in Humanitarian Action. Research and learning is also structured around the internal needs of organizations (e.g., Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies) or the outcomes of individual events (e.g., the landmark report on humanitarian sector practice fol lowing
the Indian Ocean tsunami (Telford et al., 2006). Organizations have different methodologies, target audiences, and frames of re ference,
making cross-sector learning difficult (Amin and Goldstein, 2008), but they all have led to practical and procedural changes. L ess well-
developed is active experimentation in the field of practice, with a view of proactive learning (Corbacioglu and Kapucu, 2006).  This is 
difficult in the humanitarian sector, where stakes are high and rapid action has typically made it difficult to implement learn ing-while-doing
experiments. Where experimentation may be more observable, for example, in disaster prevention and risk reduction or reconstruc tion
activities, there are significant gaps in documentation that have slowed down the transferring of learning outcomes between org aniza tions.
Hierarchical models of governance have fostered a lack of cooperation and generated competition between agencies within the
humanitarian and development sectors, partly explaining why there is more learning based on the sharing of experience inside
organizations than across sectors (Kapucu, 2009). But the increasing scale and diversity of risk associated with climate change , and
compounded by other development trends such as growing global inequality and urbanization, puts more pressure on donors to prom ote
cross-sector communication of productive innovations and of the research and experimentation such innovation builds upon.4698.6.3.4. Leadership
Leadership can be critical for disaster risk management and climate
change adaptation, particularly in initiating processes and sustainingthem over time (Moser and Ekstrom, 2010). Change processes are shapedboth by the action of individual champions (as well as by those resistingchange) and their interactions with organizations, institutional structures,
and systems. Leadership can be a driver of change, providing direction and
motivating others to follow, thus the promotion of leaders by institutions
is considered an important component of adaptive capacity (Gupta et al.,2010), although knowledge about how to create and enable leadership
remains elusive. Leadership and leaders often do not develop independentof the institutional context, which includes institutional rules, resources,
and organizational culture (Kingdon, 1995).
Leaders who facilitate transformation have the capacity to understand
and communicate a wide set of technical , social, and political perspe ctivesrelated to a particular issue or problem. They are also able to reframe
meanings, overcome contradictions, synthesize information, and createnew alliances that transform knowledge into action (Folke et al., 2009).Leadership also involves diagnosing the kinds of losses that somepeople, groups, organizations, or governments may experience throughtransformative change, such as the loss of status, wealth, security,loyalty, or competency, not to mention loved ones (Heifetz, 2010).Leaders help individuals and groups to take action to mobilize ‘adaptivework’ in their communities, such that they and others can thrive in achanging world by managing risk and creating alternative developmentpathways or engaging and directing people during times of choice andchange (Heifetz, 2010). 
8.7. Synergies between Disaster Risk
Management and Climate ChangeAdaptation for a Resilient andSustainable Future
Drawing on the assessment presented in this chapter, it becomes clear that
there are many potential synergies between disaster risk managementand climate change adaptation that can contribute to social, economic,and environmental sustainability and a resilient future. There is, however,no single approach, framework, or pathway to achieve this. Respondingto a diversity of extremes in the present and under varying social andenvironmental conditions can contribute to future resilience in situationsof uncertainty. Nonetheless, some important contributing factors havebeen identified and discussed in this chapter, and are confirmed by thewider literature (e.g., Lemos et al., 2007; Tompkins et al., 2008; Pelling,2010a; Wisner, 2011). Eight critical factors stand out as important:
1)A capacity to reconcile short- and long-term goals
2)A willingness to reconcile diverse expressions of risk in multi-hazardand multi-stressor contexts
3)The integration of disaster risk reduction and climate changeadaptation into other social and economic policy processes
4)Innovative, reflexive, and transformative leadership (at all levels)
5)Adaptive, responsive, and accountable governance
6)Support for flexibility, innovation, and learning, locally and acrosssectors
7)The ability to identify and address the root causes of vulnerability
8)A long-term commitment to managing risk and uncertainty andpromoting risk-based thinking.
Lessons learned in climate change adaptation and disaster risk
management illustrate that managing uncertainty through adaptivemanagement, anticipatory learning, and innovation can lead to moreflexible, dynamic, and efficient information flows and adaptationplans, while creating openings for transformational action. Reducingvulnerability has been identified in many contemporary disaster studiesas the most important prerequisite for a resilient and sustainable future.Research has consistently found that for long-term sustainability, disasterrisk management is most impactful when combined with structuralreforms that address underlying causes of vulnerability and the structuralChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future
Box 8-4 | Innovation and Transformation
in Water Management
The impacts of climate change in many regions are
predominantly linked to the water system, in particularthrough increased exposure to floods and droughts (Lehneret al., 2006; Smith and Barchiesi, 2009; see Section 2.5).Considering water as a key structuring element or guidingprinciple for landscape management and land use planningrequires technology, integrated systems thinking, and the artof thinking in terms of attractiveness and mutual influence, oreven mutual consent, between different authorities, experts,interest groups, and the public. One of the most pronouncedchanges can be observed in The Netherlands, where the
government has requested a radical rethinking of watermanagement in general and flood management in particular.The resulting policy stream, initiated through the ‘Room for theRiver’ (Ruimte voor de Rivier) policy, has strongly influencedother areas of government policy. Greater emphasis is now
given to the integration of water management and spatialplanning, with the regulating services provided by landscapeswith natural flooding regimes being highly valued. Thisrequires a revision of land use practices and reflects a gradualmovement toward integrated landscape planning, wherebywater is recognized as a natural, structural element. The societaldebate about the plans to build in deep-lying polders andother hydrologically unfavorable spots, and new ideas onfloating cities, indicate a considerable social engagement ofboth public and private parties with the issue of sustainablelandscapes and water management. However, although suchinnovative ideas have been adopted in policy, they take timeto implement, as there is considerable social resistance(Wolsink, 2006).470inequalities that create and sustain poverty and constrain access to
resources (Hewitt, 1983; Wisner et al., 2004; Lemos et al., 2007; Collins,2009; Pelling, 2010b).
Engaging possible and desirable futures and options for decisionmaking
fosters knowledge generation essential for adaptive risk managementas well as iterative change processes. Zooming in on uncertain elementsand their potential impacts (e.g., changes in rainfall and variability)and identifying factors that currently limit adaptive capacity (e.g.,marginalization, lack of access to resources, or information gaps) allowsfor more robust decisionmaking that also integrates local contexts (assetportfolios, spreading and managing risks) with the climate context(current trends, likely futures, and uncertainties) to identify the mostfeasible, appropriate, and equitable response strategies, policies, andexternal interventions (Pettengell, 2010). Creating space and recognizinga diversity of voices often means reframing what counts as knowledge,
engaging uncertainties, nourishing the capacity for narrative imagination,
and articulating agency and strategic adaptive responses in the face ofalready experienced changes and to anticipate and prepare for future
disturbances and shocks (Tschakert and Dietrich, 2010).
Challenges remain with respect to anticipating low-probability, high-
impact events and potentially catastrophic tipping points that representfutures too undesirable to imagine, especially under circumstances
where exposure and vulnerability are high and adaptive capacity low(Volkery and Ribeiro, 2009). At a practical level, there are many gaps andbarriers to realizing synergies for integration to foster a sustainable and
resilient future. For example, overcoming the current disconnectbetween local risk management practices and national institutional andlegal frameworks, policy, and planning can be considered key to
reconciling short- and long-term goals for vulnerability reduction. Evenwhere capacity is present, it can take effort to shift into more critical,learning modes of governance (Corbacioglu and Kapucu, 2006).Moreover, anticipating vulnerabilities as well as feasible and fair actionsmay also reveal limits of adaptation and risk management, and thusraise the potential need for transformation. Because transformativechanges open up questions about the values and priorities shapingdevelopment and risk futures, who wins and loses, and the balance oftradeoffs, decisions about when and where to facilitate transformativechange and to whose benefit are inherently normative and political.Transformation cannot be approached without understanding relatedethical and governance dimensions. At the same time, incrementalchanges, in supporting many aspects of business-as-usual, also possessimplicit ethical and normative aspects. At heart, it is perhaps in failingto fully reveal and question these normative positions that currentdisaster risk management practice and policy has remained outsideof development planning and policy processes, inhabiting a longacknowledged, but still present ‘disasters archipelago’ in the policyworld (Hewitt, 1983, p. 12).
Disasters often require urgent action and represent a time when everyday
processes for decisionmaking are disrupted. Although it is a usefulapproach in responding to emergency events and disaster relief, suchtop-down command and control frameworks work less well in disasterrisk reduction and this is likely to be the case too in integrated adaptiverisk management. In such systems, it is often the most vulnerable tohazards that are left out of decisionmaking processes (Pelling, 2003,2007; Cutter, 2006; Mercer et al., 2008), whether it is within householdsChapter 8 Toward a Sustainable and Resilient Future
FAQ 8.3 | What practical steps can we take to move toward a sustainable and resilient future?
The disruptions caused by disaster events often reveal development failures. They also provide an opportunity for reconsidering
development through reconstruction and disaster risk reduction. Practical steps can address both the root causes of risk found in
development relations, including enhancing human rights, gender equity, and environmental integrity, and more proximate causesexpressed most commonly through a need for extending land and property rights, access to critical services and basic needs, inc luding
social safety nets and insurance mechanisms, and transparent decisionmaking, especially at the local level. Identifying the dri vers of
hazard and vulnerability in ways that empower both those at risk and risk managers to take action is key. This can be done best  where
local and scientific knowledge is combined in the generation of risk maps or risk management plans. Greater use of local knowle dge
when coupled with local capacity can initiate enhanced accountability in integrated risk decisionmaking that helps to break uns ustainable
development relations. 
The uncertainty that comes with climatic variability and extremes reinforces arguments for better coordination and accountabili ty within
governance hierarchies and across sectors, as well as between generations and for non-human species in development. Local, nati onal,
and international actors bring different strengths and tools to questions of environmental change and its relationship to trend s in
human development. While offering a range of specific practical measures, both local and national approaches to risk management  can
better meet the flexibility demands of adaptation and resilience when they have strong, accountable leadership, and are enhance d by
systematic experimentation and support for innovation in the development of tools as part of planned adaptive risk managementapproaches. International actors can help by providing an institutional framework to support experimentation, innovation, and f lexibility.
This can be part of national and local strategies to move development away from incentives that promote short-term gain and tow ard
those that promote longer-term sustainability and flexibility.471(where the knowledge of women, children, or the elderly may not be
recognized), within communities (where divisions among social groupsmay hinder learning), or within nations (where marginalized groups maynot be heard, and where social division and political power influencethe development and adaptation agenda). Disaster periods are frequentlythe times when the development visions and aspirations for the futureof those most affected are not recognized. This reflects a widespreadlimitation on the quality and comprehensiveness of local participationin disaster risk reduction and its integration into everyday developmentplanning. Instead, the humanitarian imperative, limited-term reconstructionbudgets, and an understandable desire for rapid action over deliberationmeans that too often international social movements and humanitariannongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and local relieforganizations impose their own values and visions, often with the bestof intentions. It is also important to recognize the potential for somepeople or groups to prevent sustainable decisions by employing theirveto power or lobbying against reforms or regulations based on short-term political or economic interests (Klein, 2007). The distribution ofpower in society and who has the responsibility or right to shape thefuture through decisionmaking today is thus significant, and includesthe role of international as well as national and local actors. Within theinternational humanitarian community, efforts such as the SphereStandards and the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership are stepstoward addressing this challenge.
Actions to reduce disaster risk and responses to climate change
invariably involve tradeoffs with other societal goals, and conflictsrelated to different values and visions for the future. Innovative andsuccessful solutions that combine multiple perspectives, differingworldviews, and contrasting ways of organizing social relations have beendescribed by Verweij et al. (2006) as ‘clumsy solutions.’ Such solutions,they argue, depend on institutions in which all perspectives are heardand responded to, and where the quality of interactions among competingviewpoints foster creative alternatives. Drawing on the developmentethics literature, St. Clair (2010) notes that when conflict and broad-based debate arise, alternatives often flourish and many potentialspaces for action can be created, tapping into people’s innovation andcapacity to cope, adapt, and build resilience. Pelling (2010a) stressesthe importance of social learning for transitional or transformational
adaptation, and points out that it requires a high level of trust, awillingness to experiment and accept the possibility of failure in
processes of learning and innovation, transparency of values, and activeengagement of civil society. Committing to such a learning process is,
as Tschakert and Dietrich (2010, p. 17) argue, preferable to alternatives
because “learning by shock is neither an empowering nor an ethically
defensible pathway.”
The conjuncture of hazard and vulnerability, realized through disasters,
forces coping and adaptation on individuals and society. Climate changeand ongoing development place more people and assets at risk.Noteworthy progress in disaster risk management has been made,especially through the action of early warning on reducing mortality,
but underlying vulnerability remains high (as indicated by increasingnumbers of people affected and economic losses from disaster) and
demographic and economic development trends continue to raise thestakes and present a choice: risk can be denied or faced, and adaptationcan be forced or chosen. A reduction in the disaster risks associatedwith climate and weather extremes is therefore a question of politicalchoice that involves addressing issues of equity, rights, and participationat all levels.

Table of Contents489Case studies contribute more focused analyses which, in the context of human loss and damage, demonstrate the
effectiveness of response strategies and prevention measures and identify lessons about success in disaster risk reductionand climate change adaptation. The case studies were chosen to complement and be consistent with the informationin the preceding chapters, and to demonstrate aspects of the key messages in the Summary for Policymakers and the
Hyogo Framework for Action Priorities.
The case studies were grouped to examine types of extreme events, vulnerable regions, and methodological approaches.
For the extreme event examples, the first two case studies pertain to events of extreme temperature with moisturedeficiencies in Europe and Australia and their impacts including on health. These are followed by case studies on droughtin Syria and dzud , cold-dry conditions in Mongolia. Tropical cyclones in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Mesoamerica, and
then floods in Mozambique are discussed in the context of community actions. The last of the extreme events casestudies is about disastrous epidemic disease, using the case of cholera in Zimbabwe, as the example.
The case studies chosen to reflect vulnerable regions demonstrate how a changing climate provides significant concerns
for people, societies, and their infrastructure. These are: Mumbai as an example of a coastal megacity; the Republic ofthe Marshall Islands, as an example of small island developing states with special challenges for adaptation; andCanada’s northern regions as an example of cold climate vulnerabilities focusing on infrastructures.
Four types of methodologies or approaches to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) are
presented. Early warning systems; effective legislation; risk transfer in developing countries; and education, training,and public awareness initiatives are the approaches demonstrated. The case studies demonstrate that current disasterrisk management (DRM) and CCA policies and measures have not been sufficient to avoid, fully prepare for, andrespond to extreme weather and climate events, but these examples demonstrate progress.
A common factor was the need for greater information on risks before the events occur, that is, early warnings. The
implementation of early warning systems does reduce loss of lives and, to a lesser extent, damage to property andwas identified by all the extreme event case studies (heat waves, wildfires, drought, dzud, cyclones, floods, and
epidemic disease) as key to reducing impacts from extreme events. A need for improving international cooperationand investments in forecasting was recognized in some of the case studies but equally the need for regional and localearly warning systems was heavily emphasized, particularly in developing countries. 
A further common factor identified overall was that it is better to invest in preventative-based DRR plans, strategies,
and tools for adaptation than in response to extreme events. Greater investments in proactive hazard and vulnerabilityreduction measures, as well as development of capacities to respond and recover from the events were demonstrated tohave benefits. Specific examples for planning for extreme events included increased emphasis on drought preparedness;
planning for urban heat waves; and tropical cyclone DRM strategies and plans in coastal regions that anticipate these
events. However, as illustrated by the small island developing states case study, it was also identified that DRR planningapproaches continue to receive less emphasis than disaster relief and recovery.
One recurring theme is the value of investments in knowledge and information, including observational and monitoring
systems, for cyclones, floods, droughts, heat waves, and other events from early warnings to clearer understanding of
health and livelihood impacts. In all cases, the point is made that with greater information available it would be
possible to know the risks better and ensure that response strategies were adequate to face the coming threat.
Research improves our knowledge, especially when it integrates the natural, social, health, and engineering sciences
and their applications. The case studies have reviewed past events and identified lessons which could be considered
for the future. Preparedness through DDR and DRM can help to adapt to climate change and these case studies offer
examples of measures that could be taken to reduce the damage that is inflicted as a result of extreme events.
Investment in increasing knowledge and warning systems, adaptation techniques, and tools and preventive measures
will cost money now but will save money and lives in the future.Chapter 9 Case Studies
Executive Summary4909.1. Introduction
In this chapter, case studies are used as examples of how to gain a better
understanding of the risks posed by extreme weather and climate-relatedevents while identifying lessons and best practices from past responsesto such occurrences. Using the information in Chapters 1 to 8, it was
possible to focus on particular examples to reflect the needs of the
whole Special Report. The chosen case studies are illustrative of animportant range of disaster risk reduction, disaster risk management,and climate change adaptation issues. They are grouped to examinerepresentative types of extreme events, vulnerable regions, andmethodological approaches. 
For the extreme event examples, the first two case studies pertain to
extreme temperature with moisture deficiencies: the European heat wavesof 2003 and 2006 and response to disaster induced by hot weather andwildfires in Australia. Managing the adverse consequences of drought isthe third case study, with the focus on Syrian droughts. The combinationof drought and cold is examined through two recent dzud disasters in
Mongolia, 1999-2002 and 2009-2010. Tropical cyclones in Bangladesh,Myanmar, and Mesoamerica are used as examples of how a differencecan be made via enabling policies and responsive institutions forcommunity action. The next case study shifts the geographical focus tofloods in Mozambique in 2000 and 2007. The last of the extreme eventscase studies is about disastrous epidemic disease, using the case of cholerain Zimbabwe, as the example.
The case studies chosen to reflect a few vulnerable regions all demon strate
how a changing climate provides significant concerns for people,societies, and their infrastructure. The case of Mumbai is used as anexample of a coastal megacity and its risks. Small island developingstates have special challenges for adaptation, with the Republic of theMarshall Islands being the case study focus. Cold climate vulnerabilities,particularly the infrastructure in Canada’s northern regions, provide thefinal vulnerable region case study. 
Following examples of extreme events and vulnerable regions, this
chapter presents case study examination of four types of methodologies
or approaches to DRR and CCA. Early warning systems provide theopportunity for adaptive responses to reduce impacts. Effective legisla tion
to provide multi-level governance is another way of reducing impacts.
The case study on risk transfer examines the role of insurance and other
instruments in developing countries. The final case study is on education,
training, and public awareness initiatives. This selection provides a goodbasis of information and serves as an indicator of the resources needed
for future DRR and CCA. Additionally, it allows good practices to be
identified and lessons to be extracted. 
The case studies provide the opportunity for connecting with common
elements across the other chapters. Each case study is presented in a
consistent way to enable better comparison of approaches. After an
introduction, authors provide background to the event, vulnerable region,or methodology. Then the description of the events, vulnerability, orstrategy is given as appropriate. Next is the discussion of interventions,
followed by the outcomes and/or consequences. Each case studyconcludes with a discussion of lessons identified. These case studiesrelate to the key messages of the Summary for Policymakers and also tothe Hyogo Framework for Action Priorities (see Table 9-1).
Case studies are widely used in many disciplines including health care
(Keen and Packwood, 1995; McWhinney, 2001), social science (Flyvbjerg,2004), engineering, and education (Verschuren, 2003). In addition, casestudies have been found to be useful in previous IPCC AssessmentReports, including the 2007 Working Group II report (Parry et al., 2007).Case studies offer records of innovative or good practices. Specificproblems or issues experienced can be documented as well as the actionstaken to overcome these. Case studies can validate our understandingand encourage re-evaluation and learning. It is apparent that (i) casestudies capture the complexity of disaster risk and disaster situations;(ii) case studies appeal to a broad audience; and (iii) case studies shouldbe fully utilized to provide lessons identified for DRR and DRM foradaptation to climate change (Grynszpan et al., 2011). Several projectshave identified lessons from case studies (Kulling et al., 2010). TheForensic Investigation of Disaster (Burton, 2011; FORIN, 2011) Project ofthe Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (ICSU, 2008) program hasdeveloped a methodology and template for future case study investigationsto provide a basis for future policy analysis and literature for assessments.The FORIN template lays out the elements: (a) critical cause analysis; (b)meta-analysis; (c) longitudinal analysis; and (d) scenarios of disasters.
Case studies included in this chapter have been extracted from a variety
of literature sources from many disciplines. As a result, an integrated
approach examining scientific, social, health, and economic aspects ofdisasters was used where appropriate and included different spatial andtemporal scales, as needed. The specialized insights they provide can beuseful in evaluating some current disaster response practices.
This chapter addresses events whose impacts were felt in many
dimensions. A single event can produce effects that are felt on local,regional, national, and international levels. These effects could havebeen the direct result of the event itself, from the response to the event,or through indirect impacts such as a reduction in food production or adecrease in available resources. In addition to the spatial scales, thischapter also addresses temporal scales, which vary widely in bothevent-related impacts and responses. However, the way effects are feltis additionally influenced by social, health, and economic factors. Theresilience of a society and its economic capacity to allay the impact ofa disaster and cope with the after effects has significant ramificationsfor the community concerned (UNISDR, 2008a). Developing countries withfewer resources, experts, equipment, and infrastructure have been shownto be particularly at risk (see Chapter 5). Developed nations are usuallybetter equipped with technical, financial, and institutional support to enablebetter adaptive planning including preventive measures and/or quick andeffective responses (Gagnon-Lebrun and Agrawala, 2006). However, theystill remain at risk of high-impact events, as exemplified by the Europeanheat wave of 2003 and by Hurricane Katrina (Parry et al., 2007).

•`Exposure and vulnerability are key determinants of disaster risk.
A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, 
spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather 
and climate events.
Exposure and vulnerability are dynamic, varying across temporal 
and spatial scales, and depend on economic, social, geographic, 
demographic, cultural, institutional, governance, and environmental factors.
Settlement patterns, urbanization, and changes in socioeconomic 
status have all inﬂuenced observed trends in exposure and 
vulnerability to climate extremes.
Trends in exposure and vulnerability are major drivers of changes 
in disaster risk.
Inequalities inﬂuence local coping and adaptive capacity, and 
pose disaster risk management and adaptation challenges from the local to national levels.
Humanitarian relief is often required when disaster risk reduction 
measures are absent or inadequate.
Post-disaster recovery and reconstruction provide an opportunity 
for reducing weather and climate-related disaster risk and for improving adaptive capacity.
Risk sharing and transfer mechanisms at local, national, regional, 
and global scales can increase resilience to climate extremes.
Attention to the temporal and spatial dynamics of exposure and 
vulnerability is particularly important given that the design and 
implementation of adaptation and disaster risk management strategies and policies can reduce risk in the short term, but may 
increase exposure and vulnerability over the longer term.
Closer integration of disaster risk management and climate 
change adaptation, along with the incorporation of both into local, subnational, national, and international development 
policies and practices, could provide beneﬁts at all scales.
Models project substantial warming in temperature extremes by 
the end of the 21st century.
It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the 
proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls will increase in the 
21st century over many areas of the globe.
There is medium conﬁdence that droughts will intensify in the 
21st century in some seasons and areas, due to reduced precipitation and/or increased evapotranspiration.A. Context

9.2. Case Studies
9.2.1. European Heat Waves
of 2003 and 2006
9.2.1.1. Introduction
Extreme heat is a prevalent public health
concern throughout the temperate regions ofthe world and extreme heat events have beenencountered recently in North America, Asia,Africa, Australia, and Europe. It is very likely
that the length, frequency, and/or intensityof warm spells, including heat waves, willcontinue to increase over most land areas(Section 3.3.1). As with other types ofhazards, extreme heat can have disastrousconsequences, particularly for the mostvulnerable populations. Risk from extreme heatis a function of hazard severity and populationexposure and vulnerability. Extreme heatevents do not necessarily translate intoextreme impacts if vulnerability is low. It isimportant, therefore, to consider factors thatcontribute to hazard exposure and populationvulnerability. Recent literature has identifieda host of factors that can amplify or dampenhazard exposure. Experience with past heatwaves and public health interventions suggestthat it is possible to manipulate many ofthese variables to reduce both exposure andvulnerability and thereby limit the impacts ofextreme heat events. This case study, whichcompares the European heat wave of 2003with 2006, demonstrates developments indisaster risk management and adaptation toclimate change.

•`Measures that provide beneﬁts under current climate and a range 
of future climate change scenarios, called low-regrets measures, 
are available starting points for addressing projected trends in 
exposure, vulnerability, and climate extremes. They have the 
potential to offer beneﬁts now and lay the foundation for 
addressing projected changes.
Effective risk management generally involves a portfolio of 
actions to reduce and transfer risk and to respond to events and 
disasters, as opposed to a singular focus on any one action or 
type of action.
Multi-hazard risk management approaches provide opportunities 
to reduce complex and compound hazards.
Integration of local knowledge with additional scientiﬁc and 
technical knowledge can improve disaster risk reduction and 
climate change adaptation.
Appropriate and timely risk communication is critical for effective 
adaptation and disaster risk management.
1: Ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national and a local 
priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation.
2: Identify, assess and monitor disaster risks and enhance early 
warning.
3: Use knowledge, innovation and education to build a culture of 
safety and resilience at all levels.
4: Reduce the underlying risk factors.
5: Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all

mortality (Peng et al., 2010).  Extreme heat events have been encoun tered
recently in North America (Hawkins-Bell and Rankin, 1994; Klinenberg,2002), Asia (Kumar, 1998; Kalsi and Pareek, 2001; Srivastava et al., 2007),Africa (NASA, 2008), Australia (DSE, 2008b), and Europe (Robine et al.,2008; Founda and Giannakopoulos, 2009). This concern may also bepresent in non-temperate regions, but there is little research on this.
As with other types of hazards, extreme heat events can have disastrous
consequences, partly due to increases in exposure and particular typesof vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that reducing theimpacts of extreme heat events linked to climate change will necessitatefurther actions, some of which may be resource intensive and furtherexacerbate climate change.
9.2.1.2.1. Vulnerabilities to heat waves
Physiological : Several factors influence vulnerability to heat-related
illness and death. Most of the research related to such vulnerability isderived from experiences in industrialized nations. Several physiologicalfactors, such as age, gender, body mass index, and preexisting healthconditions, play a role in the body’s ability to respond to heat stress. Olderpersons, babies, and young children have a number of physiological andsocial risk factors that place them at elevated risk, such as decreasedability to thermoregulate (the ability to maintain temperature within thenarrow optimal physiologic range; Havenith, 2001). Preexisting chronicdisease – more common in the elderly – also impairs compensatoryresponses to sustained high temperatures (Havenith, 2001; Shimoda,2003). Older adults tend to have suppressed thirst impulse resulting indehydration and increased risk of heat-related illness. In addition, mul tiple
diseases and/or drug treatments increase the risk of dehydration(Hodgkinson et al., 2003; Ebi and Meehl, 2007). 
Social : A wide range of socioeconomic factors are associated with
increased vulnerability (see Sections 2.3 and 2.5). Areas with high crimerates, low social capital, and socially isolated individuals had increasedvulnerability during the Chicago heat wave in 1995 (Klinenberg, 2002).
People in areas of low socioeconomic status are generally at higher risk
of heat-related morbidity and mortality due to higher prevalence of
chronic diseases – from cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension to
pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease andasthma (Smoyer et al., 2000; Sheridan, 2003). Minorities and communitiesof low socioeconomic status are also frequently situated in higher heatstress neighborhoods (Harlan et al., 2006). Protective measures are
often less available for those of lower socioeconomic status, and even ifair conditioning, for example, is available, some of the most vulnerable
populations will choose not to use it out of concern over the cost (O’Neill
et al., 2009). Other groups, like the homeless and outdoor workers, are
particularly vulnerable because of their living situation and being moreacutely exposed to heat hazards (Yip et al., 2008). Older persons may alsooften be isolated and living alone, and this may increase vulnerability
(Naughton et al., 2002; Semenza, 2005).9.2.1.2.2. Impact of urban infrastructure
Addressing vulnerabilities in urban areas will benefit those at risk.Around half of the world’s population live in urban areas at present, andby 2050, this figure is expected to rise to about 70% (UN, 2008). Citiesacross the world are expected to absorb most of the population growthover the next four decades, as well as continuing to attract migrants fromrural areas (UN, 2008). In the context of a heat-related extreme event,certain infrastructural factors can either amplify or reduce vulnerabilityof exposed populations. The built environment is important since local heatproduction affects the urban thermal budget (from internal combustionengines, air conditioners, and other activities). Other factors also play arole in determining local temperatures, including surface reflectivity oralbedo, the percent of vegetative cover, and thermal conductivity ofbuilding materials. The urban heat island effect, caused by increasedabsorption of infrared radiation by buildings and pavement, lack ofshading, evapotranspiration by vegetation, and increased local heatproduction, can significantly increase temperatures in the urban core byseveral degrees Celsius, raising the likelihood of hazardous heat exposurefor urban residents (Clar ke, 1972; Shimoda, 2003). Street canyons where
building surfaces absorb heat and affect air flow are also areas whereheat hazards may be more severe (Santamouris et al., 1999; Louka etal., 2002). The restricted air flow within street canyons may also causeaccumulation of traffic-related air pollutants (Vardoulakis et al., 2003).
Research has also identified that, at least in the North American and
European cities where the phenomenon has been studied, these factorscan have a significant impact on the magnitude of heat hazards on aneighborhood level (Harlan et al., 2006). One study in France has shownthat higher mortality rates occurred in neighborhoods in Paris that werecharacterized by higher outdoor temperatures (Cadot et al., 2007). Hightemperatures can also affect transport networks when heat damagesroads and rail tracks. Within cities, outdoor temperatures can varysignificantly (Akbari and Konopacki, 2004), resulting in the need tofocus preventive strategies on localized characteristics.
Systems of power generation and transmission partly explain vulnera bility
since electricity supply underpins air conditioning and refrigeration – asignificant adaptation strategy particularly in developed countries, butone that is also at increased risk of failure during a heat wave (Sailorand Pavlova, 2003). It is expected that demand for electricity to powerair conditioning and refrigeration units will increase with rising ambienttemperatures. Areas with lower power capacities face increased risk ofdisruptions to generating resources and transmission under excessiveheat events.
In addition to increased demand, there can be a risk of reduced output
from power generating plants (UNEP , 2004). The ability of inland thermalpower plants, both conventional and nuclear, to cool their generators isrestricted by rising river temperatures. Additionally, fluctuating levels ofwater availability will affect energy outputs of hydropower complexes.During the summer of 2003 in France, six power plants were shut downand others had to control their output (Parry et al., 2007). Chapter 9 Case Studies4949.2.1.2.3. Heat waves and air pollution
Concentrations of air pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone are
often elevated during heat waves due to anticyclonic weather conditions,increased temperatures, and light winds. Photochemical production ofozone and emissions of biogenic ozone precursors increase during hot,
sunny weather, and light winds do little to disperse the build-up of air
pollution. Air pollution has well-established acute effects on health,particularly associated with respiratory and cardiovascular illness, and canresult in increased mortality and morbidity (WHO, 2006a). Backgroundozone levels in the Northern Hemisphere have doubled since preindustrialtimes (Volz and Kley, 1988) and increased in many urban areas over thelast few decades (Vingarzan, 2004). Air quality standards and regulationsare helping to improve air quality, although particles and ozone are stillpresent in many areas at levels that may cause harm to human health,particularly during heat waves (Royal Society, 2008; EEA, 2011). The effectsof climate change (particularly temperature increases) together with asteady increase in background hemispheric ozone levels is reducing theefficacy of measures to control ozone precursor emissions in the future(Derwent et al., 2006). The increased frequency of heat waves in thefuture will probably lead to more frequent air pollution episodes (Stottet al., 2004; Jones et al., 2008).
9.2.1.3. Description of Events
9.2.1.3.1. European heat wave of 2003
During the first two weeks of August 2003, temperatures in Europe
soared far above historical norms. The heat wave stretched across muchof Western Europe, but France was particularly affected (InVS, 2003).Maximum temperatures recorded in Paris remained mostly in the rangeof 35 to 40°C between 4 and 12 August, while minimum temperaturesrecorded by the same weather station remained almost continuouslyabove 23°C between 7 and 14 August (Météo France, 2003). The Europeanheat wave had significant health impacts (Lagadec, 2004). Initial esti mates
were of costs exceeding €13 billion, with a death toll of over 30,000across Europe (UNEP , 2004). It has been estimated that mortality overthe entire summer could have reached about 70,000 (Robine et al.,2008) with approximately 14,800 excess deaths in France alone (Pirardet al., 2005). The severity, duration, geographic scope, and impact of theevent were unprecedented in recorded European history (Grynszpan,2003; Kosatsky, 2005; Fouillet et al., 2006) and put the event in theexceptional company of the deadly Beijing heat wave of 1743, which killedat least 11,000, and possibly many more (Levick, 1859; Bouchama,
2004; Lagadec, 2004; Pirard et al., 2005; Robine et al., 2008). 
During the heat wave of August 2003, air pollution levels were high
across much of Europe, especially surface ozone (EEA, 2003). A rapid
assessment was performed for the United Kingdom after the heat wave,
using published exposure-response coefficients for ozone and PM
10
(particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of up to 10 μm). The
assessment associated 21 to 38% of the total 2,045 excess deaths inthe United Kingdom in August 2003 to elevated ambient ozone and
PM10concentrations (Stedman, 2004). The task of separating health
effects of heat and air pollution is complex; however, statistical andepidemiological studies in France also concluded that air pollution wasa factor associated with detrimental health effects during August 2003
(Dear et al., 2005; Filleul et al., 2006).
9.2.1.3.2. European heat wave of 2006
Three years later, between 10 and 28 July 2006, Europe experienced
another major heat wave. In France, it ranked second only to the one in2003 as the most severe heat wave since 1950 (Météo France, 2006;Fouillet et al., 2008). The 2006 heat wave was longer in duration than
that of 2003, but was less intense and covered less geographical area
(Météo France, 2006). Ozone levels were high across much of southern andnorthwestern Europe in July 2006, with concentrations reaching levelsonly exceeded in 2003 to date (EEA, 2007). Across France, recordedmaximum temperatures soared to 39 to 40°C, while minimum recordedtemperatures reached 19 to 23°C (compared with 23 to 25°C in 2003)(Météo France, 2006). Based on a historical model, the temperatureswere expected to cause around 6,452 excess deaths in France alone, yetonly around 2,065 excess deaths were recorded (Fouillet et al., 2008). 
9.2.1.4. Interventions
Efforts to minimize the public health impact for the heat wave in 2003were hampered by denial of the event’s seriousness and the inability ofmany institutions to instigate emergency-level responses (Lagadec,2004). Afterwards several European countries quickly initiated plans toprepare for future events (WHO, 2006b). France, the country hit hardest,developed a national heat wave plan, surveillance activities, clinicaltreatment guidelines for heat-related illness, identification of vulnerablepopulations, infrastructure improvements, and home visiting plans forfuture heat waves (Laaidi et al., 2004). 
9.2.1.5. Outcomes/Consequences
The difference in impact between the heat waves in 2003 and 2006may be at least partly attributed to the difference in the intensity andgeographic scope of the hazard. It has been considered that in Franceat least, some decrease in 2006 mortality may also be attributed toincreased awareness of the ill effects of a heat wave, the preventivemeasures instituted after the 2003 heat wave, and the heat healthwatch system set up in 2004 (Fouillet et al., 2008). While the mortalityreduction may demonstrate the efficacy of public health measures, thepersistent excess mortality highlights the need for optimizing existingpublic health measures such as warning and watch systems (Hajat et al.,2010), health communication with vulnerable populations (McCormick,2010a), vulnerability mapping (Reid et al., 2009), and heat waveresponse plans (Bernard and McGeehin, 2004). It also highlights theChapter 9 Case Studies495need for other, novel measures such as modification of the urban form
to reduce exposure (Bernard and McGeehin, 2004; O’Neill et al., 2009;Reid et al., 2009; Hajat et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2010). Thus the outcomesfrom the two European heat waves of 2003 and 2006 are extensive andare considered below. They include public health approaches to reducingexposure, assessing heat mortality, communication and education, andadapting the urban infrastructure.
9.2.1.5.1. Public health approaches to reducing exposure
A common public health approach to reducing exposure is the HeatWarning System (HWS) or Heat Action Response System. The fourcomponents of the latter include an alert protocol, community responseplan, communication plan, and evaluation plan (Health Canada, 2010).
The HWS is represented by the multiple dimensions of the EuroHeat
plan, such as a lead agency to coordinate the alert, an alert system, aninformation outreach plan, long-term infrastructural planning, andpreparedness actions for the health care system (WHO, 2007). TheEuropean Network of Meteorological Services has created Meteoalarmas a way to coordinate warnings and to differentiate them acrossregions (Bartzokas et al., 2010). There are a range of approaches usedto trigger alerts and a range of response measures implemented oncean alert has been triggered. In some cases, departments of emergencymanagement lead the endeavor, while in others public health-relatedagencies are most responsible (McCormick, 2010b). 
As yet, there is not much evidence on the efficacy of heat warning
systems. A few studies have identified an effect of heat preparednessprogramming. For example, the use of emergency medical services duringheat wave events dropped by 49% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, between1995 and 1999; an outcome that may be partly due to heat prepared ness
programming or to differences between the two heat waves (Weisskopfet al., 2002). Evidence has also indicated that interventions in Philadelphia,Pennsylvania, are likely to have reduced mortality rates by 2.6 lives per
day during heat events (Ebi et al., 2004). An Italian intervention programfound that caretaking in the home resulted in decreased hospitalizationsdue to heat (Marinacci et al., 2009). However, for all these studies, it is
not clear whether the observed reductions were due to the interventions.Questions remain about the levels of effectiveness in many circumstances(Cadot et al., 2007).
Heat preparedness plans vary around the world. Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania – one of the first US cities to begin a heat preparednessplan – has a ten-part program that integrates a ‘block captain’ systemwhere local leaders are asked to notify community members of dangerousheat (Sheridan, 2006; McCormick, 2010b). Programs like the Philadelphiaprogram that utilize social networks have the capacity to shape behaviorsince networks can facilitate the sharing of expertise and resources
across stakeholders; however, in some cases the influence of social
networks contributes to vulnerability (Crabbé and Robin, 2006). Other
heat warning systems, such as that in Melbourne, Australia, are based
solely on alerting the public to weather conditions that threaten olderpopulations (Nicholls et al., 2008). Addressing social factors in
preparedness promises to be critical for the protection of vulnerablepopulations. This includes incorporating communities themselves intounderstanding and responding to extreme events. It is important that top-down measures imposed by health practitioners account for community-level needs and experiences in order to be more successful. Greaterattention to and support of community-based measures in preventing heatmortality can be more specific to local context, such that participationis broader (Semenza et al., 2007). Such programs can best address thesocial determinants of health outcomes. 
9.2.1.5.2. Assessing heat mortality
Assessing excess mortality is the most widely used means of assessingthe health impact of heat-related extreme events. Mortality representsonly the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of heat-related health effects; however, it ismore widely and accurately reported than morbidity, which explains itsappeal as a data source. Nonetheless, assessing heat mortality presentsparticular challenges. Accurately assessing heat-related mortality faceschallenges of differences in contextual variations (Hémon and Jougla, 2004;Poumadere et al., 2005), and coroner’s categorization of deaths (Nixdorf-Miller et al., 2006). For example, there are a number of estimates ofmortality for the European heat wave that vary depending on geographicand temporal ranges, methodological approaches, and risks considered(Assemblée Nationale, 2004). The different types of analyses used toassess heat mortality, such as certified heat deaths and heat-relatedmortality measured as an excess of total mortality over a given timeperiod, are important distinctions in assessing who is affected by theheat (Kovats and Hajat, 2008). Learning from past and other countries’experience, a common understanding of definitions of heat waves andexcess mortality, and the ability to streamline death certification in thecontext of an extreme event could improve the ease and quality ofmortality reporting.
9.2.1.5.3. Communication and education
One particularly difficult aspect of heat preparedness is communicatingrisk. In many locations populations are unaware of their risk and heatwave warning systems go largely unheeded (Luber and McGeehin, 2008).Some evidence has even shown that top-down educational messagesdo not result in appropriate resultant actions (Semenza et al., 2008). Thereceipt of information is not sufficient to generate new behaviors or thedevelopment of new social norms. Even when information is distributedthrough pamphlets and media outlets, behavior of at-risk populationsoften does not change and those targeted by such interventions havesuggested that community-based organizations be involved in order tobuild on existing capacity and provide assistance (Abrahamson et al.,2008). Older people, in particular, engage better with preventioncampaigns that allow them to maintain independence and do not focuson their age, as many heat warning programs do (Hughes et al., 2008).More generally, research shows that communication about heatChapter 9 Case Studies496preparedness centered on engaging with communities results in
increased awareness compared with top-down messages (Smoyer-Tomic and Rainham, 2001). 
9.2.1.5.4. Adapting the urban infrastructure
Several types of infrastructural measures can be taken to preventnegative outcomes of heat-related extreme events. Models suggest thatsignificant reductions in heat-related illness would result from land usemodifications that increase albedo, proportion of vegetative cover,
thermal conductivity, and emissivity in urban areas (Yip et al., 2008;
Silva et al., 2010). Reducing energy consumption in buildings can improveresilience, since localized systems are less dependent on vulnerableenergy infrastructure. In addition, by better insulating residentialdwellings, people would suffer less effect from heat hazards. Financialincentives have been tested in some countries as a means to increaseenergy efficiency by supporting those who are insulating their homes.Urban greening can also reduce temperatures, protecting local popula tions
and reducing energy demands (Akbari et al., 2001).
9.2.1.6. Lessons Identified
With climate change, heat waves are very likely to increase in frequency
and severity in many parts of the world (Section 3.3.1). Smarter urbanplanning, improvements in existing housing stock and critical infrastruc ture,
along with effective public health measures will assist in facilitating cli mate
change adaptation. 
Through understanding local conditions and experiences and current and
projected risks, it will be possible to develop strategies for improvingheat preparedness in the context of climate change. The specificity ofheat risks to particular sub-populations can facilitate appropriateinterventions and preparedness.
Communication and education strategies are most effective when they
are community-based, offer the opportunity for changing social norms,
and facilitate the building of community capacity.
Infrastructural considerations are critical to reducing urban vulnerability
to extreme heat events. Effective preparedness includes building techniquesthat reduce energy consumption and the expansion of green space.
Heat wave preparedness programs may be able to prevent heat mortal ity;
however, testing and development is required to assess the most effec tive
approaches.
Further research is needed on the efficacy of existing plans, how to
improve preparedness that specifically focuses on vulnerable groups,and how to best communicate heat risks across diverse groups. Thereare also methodological difficulties in describing individual vulnerabilitythat need further exploration.9.2.2. Response to Disaster Induced by
Hot Weather and Wildfires
9.2.2.1. Introduction
Climate change is expected to increase global temperatures and change
rainfall patterns (Christensen et al., 2007). These climatic changes willincrease the risk of temperature- and precipitation-related extremeweather and climate events. The relative effects will vary by regions and
localities (Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 3.5.1). In general, an increase in
mean temperature, and a decrease in mean precipitation can contributeto increased fire risk (Flannigan et al., 2009). When in combination withsevere droughts and heat waves, which are also expected to increasein many fire regions (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.5.1), fires can becomecatastrophic (Bradstock et al., 2009). Wildfires occur in many regions ofthe world, and due to their extreme nature, authorities and the public ingeneral are acquainted with such extreme situations, and plans havebeen enacted to mitigate them. However, at times, the nature of firechallenges these plans and disasters emerge. This case study uses theexample from Victoria, Australia, in 2009. The goal is to present hotweather and wildland fire hazards and their effects and potentialimpacts, and to provide an overview of experience to learn to managethese extreme risks, as well as key lessons for the future. 
9.2.2.2. Background
Wildfire risk occurs in many regions of the globe; however embodying thisrisk in a single and practical universal index is difficult. The relationshipsbetween weather and wildfires have been studied for many areas of theworld; in some, weather is the dominant factor in ignitions, while inothers, human activities are the major cause of ignition, but weather andenvironmental factors mainly determine the area burned (Bradstock et al.,2009). Wildfire behavior is also modified by forest and land managementand fire suppression (Allen et al., 2002; Noss et al., 2006). Wildfires donot burn at random in the landscape (Nunes et al., 2005), and occur atparticular topographic locations or distances from towns or roads(Mouillot et al., 2003; Badia-Perpinyà and Pallares-Barbera, 2006;Syphard et al., 2009). The intensity and rate of spread of a wildfire isdependent on the amount, moisture content, and arrangement of finedead fuel, the wind speed near the burning zone, and the terrain andslope where it is burning. Wildfire risk is a combination of all factors thataffect the inception, spread, and difficulty of fire control and damagepotential (Tolhurst, 2010). 
9.2.2.3. Description of Events 
An episode of extreme heat waves began in South Australia on 25January 2009. Two days later they had become more widespread oversoutheast Australia. The exceptional heat wave was caused by a slow-moving high-pressure system that settled over the Tasman Sea, incombination with an intense tropical low located off the northwestChapter 9 Case Studies497Australian coast and a monsoon trough over northern Australia.
This produced ideal conditions for hot tropical air to be directed oversoutheastern Australia (National Climate Centre, 2009).
In Melbourne the temperature was above 43°C for three consecutive
days (28 to 30 January 2009), reaching a peak of 45.1°C on 30 January2009. This was the second-highest temperature on record. The extremelyhigh day and night temperatures combined to produce a record highdaily mean temperature of 35.4°C on 30 January (Victorian Government,2009). The 2008 winter season was characterized by below-averageprecipitation across much of Victoria. While November and December2008 experienced average and above average rainfall, respectively, inJanuary and February the rainfall was substantially below average(Parliament of Victoria, 2010a). During the 12 years between 1998 and2007, Victoria experienced warmer than average temperatures and a14% decline in average rainfall (DSE, 2008a). In central Victoria the 12-year rainfall totals were approximately 10 to 20% below the 1961 to1990 average (Australian Government, 2009).
This heat wave had a substantial impact on the health of Victorians,
particularly the elderly (National Climate Centre, 2009; Parliament ofVictoria, 2009). A 25% increase in total emergency cases and a 46%increase over the three hottest days were reported for the week of theheat wave. Emergency departments reported a 12% overall increase inpresentations, with a greater proportion of acutely ill patients and a37% increase in patients 75 years or older (Victorian Government,2009). Attribution of mortality to a heat wave can be difficult, as deathstend to occur from exacerbations of chronic medical conditions as wellas direct heat-related illness; this is particularly so for the frail andelderly (Kovats and Hajat, 2008). However, excess mortality can providea measure of the impact of a heat wave. With respect to total all-causemortality, there were 374 excess deaths with a 62% increase in totalall-cause mortality. The total number of deaths during the four days ofthe heat wave was 980, compared to a mean of 606 for the previousfive years. Reported deaths in people 65 years and older more thandoubled compared to the same period in 2008 (Victorian Government,2009). 
On 7 February 2009, the temperatures spiked again. The Forest Fire
Danger Index, which is calculated using variables such as temperature,
precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity (Hennessy et al., 2005),
this time reached unprecedented levels, higher than the fire weather
conditions experienced on Black Friday in 1939 and Ash Wednesday in1983 (National Climate Centre, 2009) – the two previous worse firedisasters in Victoria. 
By the early afternoon of 7 February, wind speeds were reaching their
peak, resulting in a power line breaking just outside the town of Kilmore,
sparking a wildfire that would later generate extensive pyrocumulus
cloud and become one of the largest, deadliest, and most intense
firestorms ever experienced in Australia’s history (Parliament of Victoria,
2010a). The majority of fire activity occurred between midday andmidnight on 7 February, when wind speeds and temperature were attheir highest and humidity at its lowest. A major wind change occurred
late afternoon across the fire ground, turning the northeastern flankinto a new wide fire front, catching many people by surprise. This wasone of several hundred fires that started on this day, most of whichwere quickly controlled; however, a number went on to become majorfires resulting in much loss of life. The worst 15 of these were examinedin detail by the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission (Parliament ofVictoria, 2010a). A total of 173 people died as a result of the BlackSaturday bushfires (Parliament of Victoria, 2010a). They also destroyedalmost 430,000 ha of forests, crops, and pasture, and 61 businesses(Parliament of Victoria, 2009). The Victorian Bushfires Royal Commissionconservatively values the cost of the 2009 fire at AUS$ 4.4 billion(Parliament of Victoria, 2010a).
9.2.2.4. Interventions
The Victorian Government had identified the requirement to respond topredicted heat events in the Sustainability Action Statement and ActionPlan (released in 2006 and revised in January 2009), which committed toa Victorian Heat Wave Plan involving communities and local governments.As a part of this strategy, the Victorian Government has established theheat wave early warning system for metropolitan Melbourne and isundertaking similar work for regional Victoria. The government is alsodeveloping a toolkit to assist local councils in preparing for a heat waveresponse that could be integrated with existing local government publichealth and/or emergency management plans (Victorian Government,2009). 
The ‘Prepare, Stay and Defend, or Leave Early’ (SDLE) approach instructs
that residents decide well before a fire whether they will choose toleave when a fire threatens but is not yet in the area, or whether theywill stay and actively defend their property during the fire. SDLE alsorequires residents to make appropriate preparations in advance foreither staying or leaving. Prior to 7 February 2009, the Victorian StateGovernment devoted unprecedented efforts and resources to informingthe community regarding fire risks. The campaign clearly had benefits,but there were a number of weaknesses and failures with Victoria’sinformation and warning systems (Bushfire CRC, 2009; Parliament ofVictoria, 2010b). 
Another key focus during the wildfire season is protecting the reservoirs,
especially the Upper Yarra and Thomson catchments that provide themajority of Melbourne’s water supply (Melbourne Water, 2009a). Duringthe February 2009 fires, billions of liters of water were moved fromaffected reservoirs to other safe reservoirs to protect Melbourne’s drinkingwater from contamination with ash and debris (Melbourne Water, 2009b). 
The Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission made wide-ranging
recommendations about the way fire is managed in Victoria. These haveincluded proposals to replace all single-wire power lines in Victoria, andnew building regulations for bushfire-prone areas (Parliament of Victoria,2010c).Chapter 9 Case Studies4989.2.2.5. Outcomes/Consequences
Following the findings from the various inquiries into the 2009 Victorian
Bushfires, which found failings in assumptions, policies, andimplementation, a number of far-reaching recommendations weredeveloped (Parliament of Victoria, 2010c). National responses have been
adopted through the National Emergency Management Committee,
including: (i) revised bushfire safety policies to enhance the roles ofwarning and personal responsibility; (ii) increased fuel reduction burningon public lands; (iii) community refuges established in high-risk areas; (iv)improved coordination and communication between fire organizations;(v) modifying the ‘Prepare, stay and defend, or leave early’ approach (now‘Prepare, act, survive’) to recognize the need for voluntary evacuationson extreme fire days; and (vi) further ongoing investment in bushfireresearch, including a national research center. 
9.2.2.6 Lessons Identified
Australia has recognized the need for strengthening risk managementcapacities through measures including: (i) prior public campaigns forrisk awareness; (ii) enhanced information and warning systems; (iii)translation of messages of awareness and preparedness into universalaction; (iv) sharing responsibility between government and the people;(v) development of integrated plans; and (vi) greater investment in riskmitigation and adaptation actions. 
Predicted changes in future climate will only exacerbate the impact of
other factors through increased likelihood of extreme fire danger days(Hennessy et al., 2005). We are already seeing the impact of many factors
on wildfires and heat waves, for example, demographic and land usechanges. In the future, a better understanding of the interplay of all thecausal factors is required. The Victorian Bushfires Royal Commissionstated “It would be a mistake to treat Black Saturday as a ‘one off’event. With populations at the rural-urban interface growing and theimpact of climate change, the risks associated with bushfire are likely toincrease” (Parliament of Victoria, 2010c).
9.2.3. Managing the Adverse Consequences of Drought
9.2.3.1. Introduction
Water is a critical resource throughout the world (Kundzewicz et al.,
2007). Drought can increase competition for scarce resources, cause
population displacements and migrations, and exacerbate ethnic
tensions and the likelihood of conflicts (Barnett and Adger, 2007;
Reuveny, 2007; UNISDR, 2011a). Mediterranean countries are prone todroughts that can heavily impact agricultural production, cause economiclosses, affect rural livelihoods, and may lead to urban migration(UNISDR, 2011b). This case study focuses on Syria as one of thecountries that has been affected by drought in recent years (2007-2010)(Erian et al., 2011).9.2.3.2. Background
The Eastern Mediterranean region is subject to frequent soil moisturedroughts, and in areas where annual rainfall ranges between 120-150and 400 mm, rain-fed crops are strongly affected (Erian et al., 2011).During the period from 1960 to 2006, a severe decrease in annual rain fall
has been documented in some major cities in Syria. These reductions were
related to decreases in spring and winter rainfall (Skaff and Masbate,2010). The negative trend in precipitation in Syria during the pastcentury and the beginning of the 21st century is of a similar magnitudeto that predicted by most general circulation models for the Mediterraneanregion in the coming decades (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009). 
9.2.3.3. Description of Events
Syria is considered to be a dry and semi-arid country (FAO and NAPC,2010). Three-quarters of the cultivated land depends on rainfall and theannual rate is less than 350 mm in more than 90% of the overall area(FAO, 2009; FAO and NAPC, 2010). Syria has a total population of 22million people, 47% of whom live in rural areas (UN, 2011). TheNational Programme for Food Security in the Syrian Arab Republicreported that in the national economy of Syria, the agricultural and rural
sector is vital, but with the occurrence of frequent droughts, this sector is
less certain of maintaining its contribution of about 20 to 25% of GDPand employment of about 38 to 47% of the work force (UNRCS and
SARPCMSPC, 2005; FAO and NAPC, 2010).
The prolonged drought, that in 2011 was in its fourth consecutive year,
has affected 1.3 million people, and the loss of the 2008 harvest hasaccelerated migration to urban areas and increased levels of extremepoverty (UN, 
2009 , 2011; Sowers et al., 2011). During the 2008-2009
winter grain-growing season there were significant losses of both rain-fedand irrigated winter grain crops (USDA, 2008a). This was exacerbated byabnormally hot spring temperatures (USDA, 2008a). Wheat productiondecreased from 4,041 kt in 2007 to 2,139 kt in 2008, an almost 50%reduction 
(SARPMETT, 2010). Of the farmers who depended on rain-fed
production, most suffered complete or near-total loss of crops (FAO,2009). Approximately 70% of the 200,000 affected farmers in the rain-fed areas have produced minimal to no yields because seeds were notplanted due to poor soil moisture conditions or failed germination(USDA, 2008b; FAO, 2009). 
Herders in the region were reported to have lost around 80% of their
livestock due to barren grasslands, and animal feed costs rose by 75%,forcing sales at 60 to 70% below cost (FAO, 2008). Many farmers andherders sold off productive assets, eroding their source of livelihoods,with only few small-scale herders retaining a few animals, possibly asfew as 3 to 10% (FAO, 2009).
Drought has affected the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and herders,
threatening food security and having negative consequences for entirefamilies living in affected areas (FAO, 2009; UN, 2009). It is estimatedChapter 9 Case Studies499that 1.3 million people have been affected by drought with up to
800,000 (75,641 households) being severely affected (FAO, 2009; UN,2009). Of those severely affected, around 20% (160,000 people) areconsidered to be highly vulnerable, including female-headed households,pregnant women, children 14 and under, those with illness, the elderly,and the disabled (UN, 2009).
The United Nations (UN) estimates that a large number of the severely
affected population are living below the poverty line (US$ 1/person/day)(UN, 2009). When combined with an increase in the price of food and basicresources, this reduced income has resulted in negative consequencesfor whole households (FAO, 2009). Many cannot afford basic supplies orfood, which has led to a reduction in their food inta ke, the selling of assets,
a rise in the rate of borrowing money, the degradation of land, urbanmigration, and children leaving school (FAO, 2009; UN, 2009; Solh, 2010).The UN assessment mission stated that the reasons for removing childrenfrom school included financial hardship, increased costs of transport,migration to cities, and the requirement for children to work to earnextra income for families (UN, 2009). Consequently, due to poor foodconsumption, the rates of malnutrition have risen between 2007 and 2008,with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimating a doublingof malnutrition cases among pregnant women and children under five(FAO, 2008). Due to inadequate consumption of micro- and macronutrientsin the most-affected households, it has been estimated that the averagediet contains less than 15% of the recommended daily fat intake and50% of the advised energy and protein requirements (UN, 2009).
One of the most visible effects of the drought was the large migration of
between 40,000 and 60,000 families from the affected areas (UN, 2009;Solh, 2010; Sowers and Weinthal, 2010). In June 2009, it was estimatedthat 36,000 households had migrated from the Al-Hasakah Governorate(200,000-300,000 persons) to the urban centers of Damascus, Dara’a,Hama, and Aleppo (UN, 2009; Solh, 2010). Temporary settlements andcamps were required, creating further strains on resources and publicservices, that had already been attempting to support approximately1 million Iraqi refugees (UN, 2009; Solh, 2010). In addition, migrationleads to worse health, educational, and social indicators among themigrant population (IOM, 2008; Solh, 2010).
Deficits in water resources exceeding 3.5 billion cubic meters have arisen
in recent years due to growing water demands and drought
(FAO and
NAPC, 2010; SARPMETT, 2010 ). Interventions by a project further
upstream to control the flow of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers have beeninitiated and these have had a significant impact on water variabilitydownstream in Iraq and Syria, which, added to the severe drought, havecaused these rivers to flow at well-below normal levels (USDA, 2008a;
Daoudy, 2009; Sowers et al., 2011).
9.2.3.4. Interventions
The UN Syria Drought Response Plan was published in 2009. It wasdesigned to address the emergency needs of, and to prevent further impacton, the 300,000 people most affected by protracted drought (FAO,
2009). The Response Plan identified as its strategic priorities the rapid
provision of humanitarian assistance, the strengthening of resilience to
future drought and climate change, and assisting in the return processand ensuring socioeconomic stability among the worst-affected groups(UN, 2009). Syria also welcomed international assistance provided to
the drought-affected population through multilateral channels (Solh,2010). Various loans to those affected, including farmers and women
entrepreneurs, were provided (UN, 2009).
9.2.3.5. Outcomes/Consequences
A combination of actions including food and agriculture assistance,supplemented by water and health interventions, and measures aimedat increasing drought resilience, were identified as required to allowaffected populations to remain in their villages and restart agriculturalproduction (UN, 2009). Ongoing interventions with the aim of reducingvulnerability and increasing resilience to drought were summarized bythe UN Syrian Drought Response Plan (UN, 2009) and FAO (FAO, 2009).These interventions were aimed at providing support through four mainapproaches: (1) the rapid distribution of wheat, barley, and legume seedsto 18,000 households in the affected areas, potentially assisting 144,000people; (2) sustaining the remaining asset base of the approximately20,000 herders by providing animal feed and limited sheep restockingto approximately 1,000 herders; (3) the development of a drought earlywarning system to facilitate the government taking early actions beforeserious and significant losses occur and to develop this to ensuresustainability; and (4) building capability to implement the nationaldrought strategy by developing and addressing all stages of the disastermanagement cycle (FAO, 2009). Conservation agriculture (which has beendefined as no-tillage, direct drilling/seeding, and drilling/seeding througha vegetative cover) is considered to be a way forward for sustainableland use (Stewart et al., 2008; Lalani 2011). However, how to take thisforward has caused considerable debate (Stewart et al., 2008)
. 
9.2.3.6. Lessons Identified
The need for the UN Syrian Drought Response Plan was identified andhas facilitated the understanding of the work programs and links to theinterventions listed in Case Study 9.2.3.4 (UN, 2009). Other responsestrategies that have been considered include:
•Development of capacities to identify, assess, and monitor droughtrisks through national and local multi-hazard risk assessment;building systems to monitor, archive, and disseminate data (Lalani,2011), taking into account decentralization of resources, commu nity
participation, and regional early warning systems and networks(UNISDR, 2011a).
•Integrating activities in the national strategy for CCA and DRR,including drought risk loss insurance; improved water use efficiency;adopting and adapting existing water harvesting techniques;integrating use of surface and groundwater; upgrading irrigationChapter 9 Case Studies500practices at both the farm level and on the delivery side; developing
crops tolerant to salinity and heat stress; changing cropping pat terns;
altering the timing or location of cropping activities; diversifyingproduction systems into higher value and more efficient water useoptions; and capacity building of relevant stakeholders in vulnerablenational and local areas (Abou Hadid, 2009; El-Quosy, 2009).
•Building resilience through knowledge, advocacy, research, andtraining by making information on drought risk accessible (UNISDR,2007a), and having any adaptation measures be developed aspart of, and closely integrated into, overall and country-specificdevelopment programs and strategies that should be understoodas a ‘shared responsibility’ (Easterling et al., 2007). This could beachieved through educational material and training to enhancepublic awareness (UN, 2009).
9.2.4. Recent Dzud Disasters in Mongolia
9.2.4.1. Introduction
This case study introduces dzud disaster: the impacts, intervention
measures, and efforts toward efficient response using the example oftwo events that occurred in Mongolia in 1999-2002 and 2009-2010.Mongolia is a country of greatly variable, highly arid and semi-arid climate,with an extensive livestock sector dependent upon access to grasslands(Batima and Dagvadorj, 2000; Dagvadorj et al., 2010; Marin, 2010). TheMongolian term dzud denotes unusually extreme weather conditions
that result in the death of a significant number of livestock over largeareas of the country (Morinaga et al., 2003; Oyun, 2004). Thus, the termimplies both exposure to such combinations of extreme weatherconditions but also the impacts thereof (Marin, 2010). 
9.2.4.2. Background
The climate of Mongolia is continental with sharply defined seasons,high annual and diurnal temperature fluctuations, and low rainfall(Batima and Dagvadorj, 2000). Summer rainfall seldom exceeds 380 mmin the mountains and is less than 50 mm in the desert areas (Dagvadorj
et al., 2010). Dzud is a compound hazard (see Section 3.1.3 for discus sion
of compound events) occurring in this cold dry climate, and encompasses
drought, heavy snowfall, extreme cold, and windstorms. It can last all yearround and can cause mass livestock mortality and dramatic socioeconomicimpacts – including unemployment, poverty, and mass migration fromrural to urban areas, giving rise to heavy pressure on infrastructure and
social and ecosystem services (Batima and Dagvadorj, 2000; Batjargalet al., 2001; Oyun, 2004; AIACC, 2006; Dagvadorj et.al., 2010). 
There are several types of dzud. If there is heavy snowfall, the event is
known as a white dzud , conversely if no snow falls, a black dzud occurs,
which results in a lack of drinking water for herds (Morinaga et al., 2003;Dagvadorj et al., 2010). The trampling of plants by passing livestockmigrating to better pasture or too high a grazing pressure leads to ahoof dzud , and a warm spell after heavy snowfall resulting in an icy
crust cover on short grass blocking livestock grazing causes an iron dzud
(Batjargal et al., 2001; Marin, 2008). Livestock have been the mainstayof Mongolian agriculture and the basis of its economy and culture formillennia (Mearns, 2004; Goodland et al., 2009). This sector is likely tocontinue to be the single most important sector of the economy in termsof employment (Mearns, 2004; Goodland et al., 2009). 
In the last decades, dzuds occurred in 1944-1945, 1954-1955, 1956- 1957,
1967-1968, 1976-1977, 1986-1987, 1993-1994, and 1996-1997, withfurther dzuds discussed below (Morinaga et al., 2003; Sternberg, 2010).
The dzud of 1944-1945 was a record for the 20th century with mortality
of one-third of Mongolia’s total livestock (Batjargal et al., 2001). The2009-2010 dzud caused similarly high animal mortality (NSO, 2011). The
large losses of animals in dzud events demonstrates that Mongolia as a
whole has low capacity to combat natural disaster (Batjargal et al.,2001). These potential losses are considered to be beyond the financialcapacity of the government and the domestic insurance market(Goodland et al., 2009). 
9.2.4.3. Description of Events –
Dzud of 1999-2002 and of 2009-2010
Dzud disasters occurred in 1999-2002 and 2009-2010, causing social and
economic impacts. These disasters occurred as a result of environmentaland human-induced factors. The environmental factors included droughtresulting in very limited pasture grass and hay with additional damageto pasture by rodents and insects (Batjargal et al., 2001; Begzsuren et al.,2004; Saizen et al., 2010). Human factors included budgetary issues forpreparedness in both government and households, inadequate pasturemanagement and coordination, and lack of experience of new and/oryoung herders (Batjargal et al., 2001). Climatic factors contributing toboth dzuds were summer drought followed by extreme cold and snowfall
in winter. However the autumn of 1999-2000 brought heavy snowfalland unusual warmth with ice cover, while the winter and spring of2009-2010 also brought windstorms. Summer drought was a moresignificant contributor to the 1999-2000 dzud (Batjargal et al., 2001),
while winter cold was more extreme in the 2009-2010 dzud .
9.2.4.3.1. Dzud of 1999-2002
The dzud began with summer drought followed by heavy snowfall and
unusual warmth with ice cover in the autumn and extreme cold andsnowfall in the winter. The sequence of events was as follows (Batjargalet al., 2001):
•Drought : In the summer of 1999, 70% of the country suffered
drought. Air temperature reached 41 to 43°C, exceeding its highestvalue recorded at meteorological stations since the 1960s. Thecondition persisted for a month and grasslands dried up. As aresult, animals were unfit for the winter, with insufficient haymakingfor winter preparedness. Chapter 9 Case Studies501•Iron dzud : Autumn brought early snowfall and snow depth
reached 30 to 40 cm, even 70 to 80 cm in some places. Heavysnowfall exceeding climatic means was recorded in October.Moreover, a warming in November and December by 1.7 to 3.5°Cabove the climatic mean resulted in snow cover compaction andhigh density, reaching 0.37 g cm
-3, and ice cover formation, both
of which blocked livestock pasturing.
•White dzud : In January, air temperature dropped down to -40 to
-50°C over the western and northern regions of the country. The
monthly average air temperature was lower than climatic means
by 2 to 6°C. The cold condition persisted for two months. Abundantsnowfall resulted with 80% of the country’s territory being coveredin snow of 24 to 46 cm depth. 
•Black dzud :Lack of snowfall in the Gobi region and Great Lake
depression caused water shortages for animals.
•Hoof dzud : The improper pasture management led to unplanned
concentration of a great number of livestock in a few counties inthe middle and south Gobi provinces that were not affected bydrought and snowfall.
Animals were weakened as a result of long-lasting climatic hardship
and forage shortage of this dzud (Batjargal et al., 2001). After three
years of dzuds that occurred in sequence, the country had lost nearly
one-third (approximately 12 million) of its livestock and Mongolia’snational gross agricultural output in 2003 decreased by 40% comparedto that in 1999 (Mearns, 2004; Oyun, 2004; AIACC, 2006; Lise et al.,2006; Saizen et al., 2010). It was reported that in 1998 there were anestimated 190,000 herding households but as a result of the dzud,
11,000 families lost all their livestock (Lise et al., 2006). Thus the dzud
had severe impacts on the population and their livelihoods, includingunemployment, poverty, and negative health impacts (Batjargal et al.,2001; Oyun, 2004; AIACC, 2006; Morris, 2011). 
9.2.4.3.2. Dzud of 2009-2010
In the summer of 2009, Mongolia suffered drought conditions, restricting
haymaking and foraging (UNDP Mongolia, 2010; Morris, 2011). Rainfallat the end of November became a sheet of ice, and, in late December,19 of 21 provinces recorded temperatures below -40°C; this was followedby heavy and continuous snowfall in January and February 2010(Sternberg, 2010; UNDP Mongolia, 2010). Over 50% of all the countryherders’ households and their livestock were affected by the dzud
(Sternberg, 2010). By April, 75,000 herder families had lost all or more
than half their livestock (Sternberg, 2010).
9.2.4.4. Interventions
9.2.4.4.1. Dzud of 1999-2002
The government of Mongolia issued the order for intensification of winter
preparedness in August 1999, but allocated funding for its implementa tionin January 2000, by which time significant animal mortality had already
occurred (Batjargal et al., 2001). The government then appealed to itscitizens and international organizations for assistance and relief, includingdistribution of money, fodder, medicine, clothes, flour, rice, high energyand high protein biscuits for children, health and veterinary services,medical equipment, and vegetable seeds (Batjargal et al., 2001).Capacity-building activities through mass media campaigns were alsocarried out, focused on providing advice on methods of care and feedingfor weak animals (Batjargal et al., 2001). 
Herders rely upon traditional informal coping mechanisms and ad hoc
support from government and international agencies (Mahul and Skees,2005). For affected areas, after immediate relief, the main longer termsupport has conventionally been through restocking programs (Mahuland Skees, 2005). Evaluation has shown that these can be expensive,relatively inefficient, and fail to provide the right incentives for herders(Mahul and Skees, 2005). Restocking in areas with drought, poor pasturecondition, and unfit animals can actually increase livestock vulnerabilityin the following year (Mahul and Skees, 2005) as a result of greatercompetition for scarce resources.
The government has prioritized the livestock sector with parliament-
approved state policy (MGH, 2003) and, with support from donors,responded to dzud disasters with reforms that include greater flexibility
in pasture land tenure, coupled with increased investment in ruralinfrastructure and services (Mahul and Skees, 2005). However, livestocksector reforms and approaches have not yet proved sufficient to copewith catastrophic weather events (Mahul and Skees, 2005). Althoughthe State Reserves Agency is working to reduce the effects of dzud,
catastrophic livestock mortality persists (Mahul and Skees, 2005). 
9.2.4.4.2. Dzud of 2009-2010
At a local level :The National Climate Risk Management Strategy and
Action Plan (MMS, 2009 )sets a goal of building climate resilience at the
community level through reducing risk and facilitating adaptation by: (i)improving access to water through region-specific activities such asrainwater harvesting and creation of water pools from precipitation andflood waters, for use for animals, pastureland, and crop irrigation purposes;(ii) improving the quality of livestock by introducing local selectivebreeds with higher productivity and more resilient to climate impacts;(iii) strengthened veterinarian services to reduce animal diseases andparasites and cross-border epidemic infections; and (iv) using traditionalherding knowledge and techniques for adjusting animal types and herdstructure to make appropriate for the carrying capacity of the pasturelandand pastoral migration patterns. The formation of herders’ communitygroups and establishment of pasture co-management teams (Ykhanbai etal., 2004), along with better community-based disaster risk management,could also facilitate effective DRR and CCA (Baigalmaa, 2010). 
At a national level : Mongolia’s millennium development priorities
clearly state an aim to adapt to climate change and desertification andChapter 9 Case Studies502to implement strategies to minimize negative impacts (Mijiddorj,
2008; UNDP Mongolia, 2009a). The recent national CCA report outlinesgovernment strategy priorities as: (i) education and awareness campaignsamong the decisionmakers, rural community, herders, and the generalpublic; (ii) technology and information transfer to farmers and herdsmen;
(iii) research and technology to ensure the development of agriculturethat could successfully deal with various environmental problems; and(iv) improved coordination of stakeholders’ activities based on research,inventory, and monitoring findings (Dagvadorj et al., 2010). Themanagement of risk in the livestock sector requires a combination ofapproaches. Traditional herding and pastoral risk reduction practicescan better prepare herders for moderate weather events. For country-wide dzud events, however, high levels of livestock mortality are often
unavoidable, even for the most experienced herders, and pastureresource and herd management must be complemented by risk-financingmechanisms that provide herders with instant liquidity in the aftermathof a disaster (Goodland et al., 2009).
At an international level : As Mongolia is a country extremely prone
to natural disasters, addressing climate change risks is a priority inMongolia. In 2009, the Mongolian Government undertook the project‘Strengthening the Disaster Mitigation and Management Systems inMongolia’ under the National Emergency Management Agency (UNDPMongolia, 2009b; Sternberg, 2010).
9.2.4.5. Consequences
The most critical consequences of dzud are increased poverty and mass
migration from rural to urban and from remote to central regions (Oyun,2004; Dagvadorj et al., 2010). According to national statistics there hasbeen a continuous increase in poverty over the last decade (NSO, 2011).
In response to the climatic hardship, a growing proportion of the rural
population has migrated to urban areas and the central region (Dagvadorjet al., 2010; UNDP Mongolia, 2010). Livestock-herding families areforced to migrate because of poverty caused by loss of livestock fromcatastrophic weather events (Sternberg, 2010). Besides poverty, thereare reasons why members of herding families may wish to leave the
livestock sector, including obtaining a better education for their childrenand access to health care (Mahul and Skees, 2005). Many migrants
travel from Western Mongolia to the capital city Ulaanbaatar (Saizen et
al., 2010; Sternberg, 2010).
9.2.4.6. Lessons Identified 
Current policies and measures are mainly limited to post-disaster
government relief and restocking activities with donors’ funding and
individual herder’s traditional knowledge and practices (Batjargal et al.,
2001; AIACC, 2006). These can be insufficient to avoid, prepare for, and
respond to a dzud (Goodland et al., 2009). Various practices have been
identified as effective for DRR, and could further contribute to promoteCCA. These include localized seasonal climate prediction and improve ment
of early warning (Morinaga et al., 2003; MMS, 2009), risk-insuring sys tems
(Skees and Enkh-Amgalan, 2002; Mahul and Skees, 2005), and policy(Batjargal et al., 2001; AIACC, 2006; Goodland et al., 2009). 
At present, adaptation occurs through increased mobility of herders in
search of better pasture for their animals in dzud disasters (Batjargal et
al., 2001), and as a response to changed rain patterns occurring oversmall areas, which the herders call ‘silk embroidery rain’ (Marin, 2010).Livelihood diversification to create resilient livelihoods for herders hasalso been seen as being effective for building climate resilience (Mahuland Skees, 2005; Borgford-Parnell, 2009; MMS, 2009, Dagvadorj et al.,2010).
9.2.5. Cyclones: Enabling Policies and
Responsive Institutions for Community Action
9.2.5.1. Introduction
Tropical cyclones, also called typhoons and hurricanes, are powerful
storms generated over tropical and subtropical waters. Their extremelystrong winds damage buildings, infrastructure and other assets; thetorrential rains often cause floods and landslides; and high waves andstorm surge often lead to extensive coastal flooding and erosion – all ofwhich have major impacts on people. Tropical cyclones are typicallyclassified in terms of their intensity, based on measurements or estimates
of near-surface wind speed (sometimes categorized on a scale of 1 to 5according to the Saffir-Simpson scale). The strongest storms (Categories3, 4, and 5) are comparatively rare but are generally responsible for themajority of damage (Section 3.4.4).
The focus of this case study is the comparison between the response to
Indian Ocean cyclones in Bangladesh (Sidr in 2007) and in Myanmar(Nargis in 2008) in the context of the developments in preparednessand response in Bangladesh resulting from experiences with CycloneBhola in 1970, Gorky in 1991, and other events. To provide a moreglobal context, the impacts and responses to 2005 Hurricanes Stan and
Wilma in Central America and Mexico are also discussed. These clearlydemonstrate that climate change adaptation efforts can be effective inlimiting the impacts from extreme tropical cyclone events by use ofdisaster risk reduction methods.
Changes in tropical cyclone activity due to anthropogenic influences are
discussed in Section 3.4.4. There is low confidence that any observed long-
term increases in tropical cyclone activity are robust, after accounting forpast changes in observing capabilities. The uncertainties in the historicaltropical cyclone records, the incomplete understanding of the physicalmechanisms linking tropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and thedegree of tropical cyclone variability provide only low confidence for the
attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity toanthropogenic influences. There is low confidence in projections of
changes in tropical cyclone genesis, location, tracks, duration, or areasChapter 9 Case Studies503of impact. Based on the level of consistency among models, and physical
reasoning, it is likely that tropical cyclone-related rainfall rates will
increase with greenhouse warming. It is likely that the global frequency
of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially
unchanged. An increase in mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speedis likely , although increases may not occur in all tropical regions. While
it is likely that overall global frequency will either decrease or remain
essentially unchanged, it is more likely than not that the frequency of
the most intense storms will increase substantially in some oceanbasins. Although there is evidence that surface sea temperature (SST) inthe tropics has increased due to increasing greenhouse gases, theincreasing SST does not yet have a fully understood physical link toincreasingly strong tropical cyclones (Section 3.4.4).
9.2.5.2. Indian Ocean Cyclones
Although only 15% of world tropical cyclones occur in the North IndianOcean (Reale et al., 2009), Bangladesh and India account for 86% ofmortality from tropical cyclones (UNISDR, 2009c). The 2011 GlobalAssessment Report (UNISDR, 2011b) provides strong evidence thatweather-related mortality risk is highly concentrated in countries withlow GDP and weak governance. Many of the countries exposed totropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean are characterized by highpopulation density and vulnerability and low GDP . 
9.2.5.2.1. Description of events – Indian Ocean cyclones
In 2007, Cyclone Sidr made landfall in Bangladesh on 15 November andcaused over 3,400 fatalities (Paul, 2009). Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmaron 2 May 2008 and caused over 138,000 fatalities (CRED, 2009; Yokoiand Takayabu, 2010), making it the eighth deadliest cyclone ever recorded(Fritz et al., 2009). Sidr and Nargis were both Category 4 cyclones ofsimilar severity; affecting coastal areas with a comparable number ofpeople exposed (see Table 9-2). Although Bangladesh and Myanmarboth are considered least developed countries (Giuliani and Peduzzi,2011), these two comparable events had vastly different impacts. Thereasons for the differences follow.9.2.5.2.2. Interventions – Indian Ocean cyclones
Bangladesh has a significant history of large-scale disasters (e.g., CyclonesBhola in 1970 and Gorky in 1991; see Table 9-2). The Government ofBangladesh has made serious efforts aimed at DRR from tropical cyclones.It has worked in partnership with donors, nongovernmental organizations(NGOs), humanitarian organizations and, most importantly, withcoastal communities themselves (Paul, 2009).
First, they constructed multi-storied cyclone shelters with capacity for
500 to 2,500 people (Paul and Rahman, 2006) that were built in coastalregions, providing safe refuge from storm surges for coastal populations.Also, killas (raised earthen platforms), which accommodate 300 to 400livestock, have been constructed in cyclone-prone areas to safeguardlivestock from storm surges (Paul, 2009). 
Second, there has been a continued effort to improve forecasting and
warning capacity in Bangladesh. A Storm Warning Center has beenestablished in the Meteorological Department. System capacity has beenenhanced to alert a wide range of user agencies with early warningsand special bulletins, soon after the formation of tropical depressions inthe Bay of Bengal. Periodic training and drilling practices are conductedat the local level for cyclone preparedness program (CPP) volunteers foreffective dissemination of cyclone warnings and for raising awarenessamong the population in vulnerable communities.
Third, the coastal volunteer network (established under the CPP) has
proved to be effective in disseminating cyclone warnings among thecoastal communities. These enable time-critical actions on the ground,including safe evacuation of vulnerable populations to cyclone shelters(Paul, 2009). With more than sevenfold increase in cyclone shelters andtwofold increase in volunteers from 1991 to 2007, 3 million people weresafely evacuated prior to landfall of Sidr in 2007 (Government ofBangladesh, 2008). 
In addition, a coastal reforestation program, including planting in the
Sundarbans, was initiated in Bangladesh in the late 1960s, coveringriverine coastal belt and abandoned embankments (Saenger and Siddiqi,1993). Sidr made landfall on the western coast of Bangladesh, which isChapter 9 Case Studies

region is the least-populated coastal area in the country and has beenpart of a major reforestation effort in recent years (Hossain et al., 2008).The Sundarbans provided an effective attenuation buffer during Sidr,greatly reducing the impact of the storm surge (Government ofBangladesh, 2008).
In contrast to Bangladesh, Myanmar has very little experience with
previous powerful tropical cyclones. The landfall of Nargis was the firsttime in recorded history that Myanmar experienced a cyclone of such amagnitude and severity (Lateef, 2009) and little warning was provided.
9.2.5.2.3. Outcomes – Indian Ocean cyclones
Despite Nargis being both slightly less powerful and affecting fewerpeople than Sidr, it resulted in human losses that were much higher.Bangladesh and Myanmar are both very poor countries with low levelsof HDI (World Bank, 2011a). The relatively small differences in povertyand development cannot explain the discrepancy in the impacts of Sidrand Nargis. However, the governance indicators developed by the WorldBank (Kaufmann et al., 2010) suggest significant differences betweenBangladesh and Myanmar in the quality of governance, notably in voiceand accountability, rule of law, regulatory quality, and governmenteffectiveness. Low quality of governance, and especially voice andaccountability, has been highlighted as a major vulnerability componentfor human mortality due to tropical cyclones (Peduzzi et al., 2009).
9.2.5.3. Mesoamerican Hurricanes
9.2.5.3.1. Description of events – Mesoamerican hurricanes
Central America and Mexico (Mesoamerica) are heavily affected by
strong tropical storms. From 1-13 October 2005, Hurricane Stan affectedthe Atlantic coast of Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.Stan was a relatively weak storm that only briefly reached hurricanestatus. It was associated with a larger non-tropical storm system thatresulted in torrential rains and caused debris flows, rockslides, and
widespread flooding. Guatemala reported more than 1,500 fatalities andthousands of missing people. El Salvador reported 69 fatalities whileMexico reported 36 (CRED, 2009). Wilma hit one week later (19-24
October). It was an intense cyclone in the Atlantic (National Hurricane
Center, 2006; Table 9-2), with winds reaching a speed of 297 km h
-1.
Wilma caused 12 fatalities in Haiti, 8 in Mexico, and 4 in the United States.Most residents in western Cuba, and tourists and local inhabitants in
the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, were evacuated (CRED, 2009). 
9.2.5.3.2. Interventions – Mesoamerican hurricanes
While Stan mainly affected the poor indigenous regions of Guatemala,
El Salvador, and Chiapas, Wilma affected the international beach resortof Cancun. A joint study of Mexico’s response to the hurricanes funded
by the World Bank and conducted through the Economic Commissionfor Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, 2006) and its Commissionfor Latin American and the Caribbean and the Mexican National Centerfor Prevention of Disasters (García et al., 2006) showed that Stancaused about US$ 2.2 billion damage in that country, 65% of whichwere direct losses and 35% due to future impacts on agriculturalproduction. About 70% of these damages were reported in the state ofChiapas (Oswald Spring, 2011), representing 5% of the GDP of the state. 
Comparing the management of the two hurricanes by the Mexican
authorities, in the same month and year, highlights important issues inDRM. Evacuation of areas in Mexico affected by Stan only started duringthe emergency phase, when floods in 98 rivers had already affected800 communities. 100,000 people fled from the mountain regions toimprovised shelters – mostly schools – and ‘guest families’ (OswaldSpring, 2010). In comparison, following the early alert for Wilma, peoplewere evacuated from dangerous places, most tourists were moved tosafe areas, and local inhabitants and remaining tourists were taken toshelters (García et al., 2006). Before the hurricane hit the coast, heavymachines and emergency groups were mobilized in the region, toreestablish water, electricity, communications, and health servicesimmediately after the event. After the disaster, all ministries wereinvolved in reopening the airport and tourist facilities as quickly aspossible. By December, most hotels were operating, and the sand lostfrom the beaches had been reestablished (Oswald Spring, 2011). 
9.2.5.3.3. Outcomes – Mesoamerican hurricanes
Comparing government responses to these two hurricanes in the samemonth, it is possible to note vastly different official actions in terms ofearly warning, evacuation, and reconstruction (Oswald Spring, 2011).The federal institutions in charge of DRM functioned well duringHurricane Wilma. A massive recovery support strategy restored almostall services and hotels in Cancun within two months, with a significantportion of costs being covered by insurance companies (García et al.,2006). The government response to Stan left the poor indigenouspopulation with limited advice, insufficient disaster relief, and scantreconstruction support, especially among the most marginal groups(Oswald Spring, 2011).
9.2.5.4. Lessons Identified
Comparative studies of disaster risk management practices for tropicalcyclones demonstrate that choices and outcomes for response to cli matic
extreme events are triggered by multiple interacting processes, andcompeting priorities. Indigenous, poor, and illiterate people have lowresilience, limited resources, and are highly exposed without earlywarnings and DRM. Government response to similar extreme eventsmay be quite different in neighboring countries, or even within the samecountry. Chapter 9 Case Studies505Tropical cyclone DRM strategies in coastal regions that create protective
measures, and anticipate and plan for extreme events, along withcontinuing changes in vulnerability and in causal processes, increase theresilience of potentially exposed communities. International cooperationand investment in the following measures are essential in improving thecapacity of developing nations in coping with extreme tropical cycloneevents:
•Improvement of forecasting capacity and implementation ofimproved early warning systems (including evacuation plans andinfrastructure)
•Protection of healthy ecosystems
•Post-disaster support service to dispersed communities
•Transparent management of recovery funds directly with the victims.
Awareness, early warnings and evacuation, hurricane experience, disaster
funds, and specialized bodies reduce the impact of tropical cyclones onsocially vulnerable people. Good governance and participation ofpeople at risk in the decisionmaking process may overcome conflictinggovernmental priorities. Disaster risk management is most effectivelypursued by understanding the diverse ways in which social processescontribute to the creation, management, and reduction of disaster riskwith the involvement of people at risk. A development planningperspective that includes disaster risk management as an integral partof the development framework is the key to a coherent strategy for thereduction of risk associated with extreme weather events. 
9.2.6. Managing the Adverse Consequences of Floods
9.2.6.1. Introduction
Floods are a major natural hazard in many regions of the world (Ahern
et al., 2005). Averaged over 2001 to 2010, floods and other hydrologicalevents accounted for over 50% of the disasters (Guha-Sapir et al.,2011); for example, it was reported that, in 2007, flooding worldwideaccounted for four of the top five deadliest natural disasters (Subbaraoet al., 2008). Currently about 800 million people live in flood-prone areasand about 10% are annually exposed to floods (Chapter 4; Peduzzi etal., 2011; UNISDR, 2011b). Causes of floods are varied, but may occuras a result of heavy, persistent, and sustained rainfall or as a result ofcoastal flooding (Ahern et al., 2005; see also Section 3.5.2). Flooding
impacts are wide ranging, potentially interrupting food and water
supplies, affecting economic development, and causing acute as well as
subsequent long-term health impacts (Ahern et al., 2005; Subbarao et
al., 2008). It is important to study flooding events to develop or enhancereliable approaches to risk reduction as well as systems for forecasting and
informing the population, in order to help minimize negative consequences(ICSU, 2008). This case study examines the impacts on the populationand economy of Mozambique from the 2000 and 2007 flooding events. 
Effective functioning of DRR and DRM programs at all levels can help to
reduce the risks from extreme events including floods (UNISDR, 2005a).
These programs operate best with a combination of local, national, andinternational strategies (Hellmuth et al., 2007; UNISDR, 2011a). A
variety of strategies have been used to reduce the impact of floods. Forexample, dams and sea walls prevent flooding of coastal areas but areexpensive and difficult to maintain and these facilities can be breached(ProAct Network, 2008). Furthermore, urban drainage systems arerecognized as an important tool to reduce urban flood risk, but lessthan half (46%) of low-income countries have invested in drainageinfrastructure in flood-prone areas (UNISDR, 2011b). Timely floodwarnings in many countries have been developed as part of DRR andDRM programs (Case Study 9.2.11).
The Global Assessment Report (UNISDR, 2011b) reported that the 2000
floods in Mozambique are one of the four examples of large disastersthat have highlighted DRM capacity gaps that have led to institutionaland legislative changes.
9.2.6.2. Background
Mozambique has high socioeconomic vulnerability with approximately50% of its population of 21 million living below the poverty line (seeSections 2.3 and 2.5; WMO, 2011a; World Bank, 2011b). Its developmenthas been restricted by previous civil war and conflict with neighboringSouth Africa. Further examples of its vulnerability include risingHIV/AIDS rates, an almost 70% female illiteracy rate, and most of thepopulation depending on subsistence farming (Hellmuth et al., 2007;World Bank, 2011b).
Geographic position and climatic factors contribute to Mozambique’s
high physical vulnerability. Mozambique has a 2,700-km coastline andthe whole country and neighboring countries are subjected to cyclonesand resultant flooding (Hellmuth et al., 2007; WMO, 2011a; World Bank,2011b). Nine of the 11 rivers in Mozambique are transboundary (Hellmuthet al., 2007) making its location downstream more susceptible to rainfallevents across a large region such that increases in river levels and flowsin neighboring countries can result in or exacerbate floods. Thereforethe development and operating of early warning and flood control sys tems
in Mozambique depend on a close collaboration with other countries ofthe Southern Africa Development Community and its protocol on sharedwatercourse systems (SADC, 2000).
The World Bank (2005a) reported that Mozambique experienced 12 major
floods, 9 major droughts, and 4 major cyclone events between 1965 and1998. In 1999, a national government policy on disaster managementwas articulated and a National Institute for Disaster Management(NIDM), with an emphasis on coordination rather than delivery, created(World Bank, 2005a).
9.2.6.3. Description of Events – 2000 Floods in Mozambique
In February 2000, catastrophic floods caused the loss of more than 700lives with over half a million people losing their homes, and more thanChapter 9 Case Studies5064.5 million affected (Mirza, 2003; Hellmuth et al., 2007; WMO, 2011a;
World Bank, 2011b). 
The flooding was the result of a cascade of events. It started withabove-
average rainfall in southern Mozambique and adjacent countries
from October to December 1999 (Hellmuth et al., 2007). Exacerbating
the situation was the series of cyclones Astride, Connie, Eline, and Gloriawith the main impact coming from cyclone Eline (UNESC, 2000; Asanteet al., 2007; Hellmuth et al., 2007). Cyclone Eline, after tracking over7,000 km west across the tropical south Indian Ocean (Reason and Keibel,2004), made landfall on 22 February 2000, crossing the Mozambiquecoastline and moving over the headwater basins of the Limpopo River,making a critical situation worse. 
The rainfall that occurred over Mozambique and the northeastern parts
of South Africa and Zimbabwe was exceptional; record flooding ensueddownstream on the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers (Carmo Vaz, 2000;Kadomura, 2005), and in parts of the Sabie catchment the return periodwas in excess of 200 years (Smithers et al., 2001).
As a result of the floods it was reported that many small towns and
villages remained under water for approximately two months (Hellmuthet al., 2007). Access roads were rendered impassable with railways, bridges,water management systems (including water intake and treatmentplants), and more than 600 primary schools damaged or destroyed(UNESC, 2000; Dyson and van Heerden, 2001; Reason and Keibel, 2004).The UN World Food Programme reported that Mozambique lost 167,000ha of agricultural land (FAO and WFP , 2000). Dams were overwhelmed;for example, the total inflow to Massingir reservoir between Januaryand March was approximately eight times the storage capacity of thereservoir at that time (Carmo Vaz, 2000). 
Although floodwaters can wash away breeding sites and, hence, reduce
mosquito-borne disease transmission (Sidley, 2000), the collection ofemergency clinic data and interviews of 62 families found that theincidence of malaria was reported as increasing by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0.Diarrhea also increased by a factor of 2 to 4 (Kondo et al., 2002).
The government declared an emergency, mobilized its disaster response
mechanisms, and made appeals for assistance from other countries
(Hellmuth et al., 2007).The enormous material damage and humanlosses during the floods in Mozambique in 2000 were associated withthe following problems:
•Institutional problems : It was only in 1999 that the National
Policy on Disaster Management in Mozambique began to shift
from a reactive to a proactive approach, with an aim to develop a
culture of prevention (Asante et al., 2005; Hellmuth et al., 2007).
•Technological problems :In 2000, in Mozambique, there were
problems with the installation and maintenance of in situ gauging
equipment due to financial constraints. In addition, the hydrologicaland precipitation gauges were washed away and many key stationswere destroyed, leaving Mozambican water authorities with no
source of information on the actual magnitude of floodwaters(Dyson and van Heerden, 2001; Smithers et al., 2001; Asante et
al., 2005).
•Financial problems :The UN Economic and Social Council (UNESC,
2000) reported that the Government of Mozambique responded tothe emergency despite limited means, but due to the extensiveinternational financial support requested help in its coordinationfrom the UN. The World Bank estimates that the direct losses as aresult of the 2000 floods amounted to US$ 273 million (UNESC,2000). 
9.2.6.4. Interventions 
After the catastrophic floods in 2000, the Government of Mozambiquetook a range of measures to improve the effectiveness of disaster riskmanagement. In 2001, an Action Plan for the Reduction of AbsolutePoverty (PARPA I) was adopted (Republic of Mozambique, 2001); andthis was revised for the period 2006 to 2009 (PARPA II) (Republic ofMozambique, 2006a,b; Foley, 2007). In 2006, the government alsoadopted a Master Plan, which provides a comprehensive strategy fordealing with Mozambique’s vulnerability to natural disasters (Republicof Mozambique, 2006a). 
After the 2000 floods, Mozambique implemented intensive programs to
move people to safe areas (World Bank, 2005a). Since the 2000 floods,a large resettlement program for communities affected by the floodsand tropical cyclones was initiated, with about 59,000 families resettledalthough a lack of funds for improved livelihoods has reduced thesuccess of this program (WMO, 2011a). 
Success and effectiveness of warnings depend not only on the accuracy
of the forecast, but also their delivery in adequate time before thedisaster to put in place prevention strategies. From November 2006 toNovember 2007 the Severe Weather Forecasting Demonstration Project,conducted by the World Meteorological Organization in southeastern
Africa, tested a new concept for capacity building and this service
contributed to the forecasting and warnings about Cyclone Favio in
February 2007 (Poolman et al., 2008). The demonstration phase was foundto be valuable, and the implementation phase – with training, supportedwith efficient and effective forecasting and warning of tropical cyclonesin developing countries – continues (WMO, 2011b).
Besides high-level alerting it is important that a warning is received
by each person in the disaster zone, in an easily understandable way(UNISDR, 2010). In 2005 and 2006 the German Agency for TechnicalCooperation developed a simple but effective early warning system alongthe River Búzi (
Bollin et al., 2005; Loster and Wolf, 2007). This warning
system was adapted to the specific needs and skills of the people. Thevillage officials receive daily precipitation and water levels at strategicpoints along the Búzi River basin. If precipitation is particularly heavy orthe river reaches critical levels, this information is passed on by radioand blue, yellow, or red flags are raised depending on the flood alertlevel 
(Bollin et al., 2005; UNISDR, 2010) . Chapter 9 Case Studies5079.2.6.5. Outcomes/Consequences – 2007 Floods in Mozambique 
Seven years after the catastrophic floods of 2000, similar flooding
occurred in Mozambique, but the country was prepared to a greaterextent than before. Between December 2006 and February 2007, heavyrains across northern and central Mozambique together with a severe
downpour in neighboring countries led to flooding in the Zambezi River
basin (IFRC, 2007). Additional flooding was caused by the approach oftropical cyclone Favio, which struck the Búzi area at the end of February2007 (Poolman et al., 2008). During the flood period on the southerncoast of Mozambique, 29 people were killed, 285,000 people affected,and approximately 140,000 displaced (Kienberger, 2007; World Bank,2011b). The heavy rains and floods damaged health centers, publicbuildings, drug stocks, and medical equipment and affected safe waterand sanitation facilities (UNOCHA, 2007). In total, the floods and cyclonecaused approximately US$ 71 million of damage to local infrastructureand destroyed 277,000 ha of crops (USAID, 2007). 
During the course of January 2007, it became clear that there was an
imminent threat of severe flooding in the Zambezi River basin valley(Foley, 2007). A multinational flood warning covering Zambia, Malawi,and Mozambique was issued on 26 January 2007. With forecasts andwarnings increasing over the next week, NIDM increased the floodwarning until a ‘Red Alert’ was issued (UNISDR, 2010). This was a testof the earlier work undertaken by Bollin et al. (2005); when the riversrose rapidly, it was reported that approximately 12,800 people whowere at risk had been well prepared by prior training (Loster and Wolf,2007). The district’s disaster mitigation committee had alerted threat ened
villages two days previously (blue-flag alert) and now with a red-flagalert announced evacuations, which were completed in less than twodays, with approximately 2,300 going to accommodation centers (Losterand Wolf , 2007). 
In the emergency period, NIDM, with local and international partner
organizations, established networks with local centers to coordinate theemergency operations. The International Federation of Red Cross andRed Crescent Societies and its local partners, the US Agency forInternational Development, and other organizations worked to distributebasic goods, food, and medical assistance during the emergency period
(IFRC, 2007; USAID, 2007).
A resettlement program, although a policy of last resort, to move
inhabitants from flood-prone areas to safer areas was initiated (Stal,
2011; WMO, 2011a). Resettlement is not an easy option. Although brick-built housing was provided in flood-safe areas with new (or nearby)
schools and health facilities, these have not been as well received asintended as these flood-safe resettlements suffer from water scarcity
and drought, and growing crops is therefore difficult (Stal, 2011).
The floods of 2000 and 2007 along with other natural hazards are
considered to have undone years of development efforts (Sietz et al., 2008)
and to have undermined national efforts in realizing Mozambique’s
poverty reduction strategy (IMF , 2011).9.2.6.6. Lessons Identified
This comparison of the two floods events that occurred in Mozambiquein 2000 and 2007 shows:
• Floods, as one of the most dangerous natural phenomena, are a
real threat to the sustainable development of nations (Ahern et al.,
2005; Guha-Sapir et al., 2011)
• The consequences of floods depend on the long-term adaptation
to extremes of climate, and associated hydrologic extremes requirefurther understanding. After the 2000 floods in Mozambique, nationaland international organizations updated their strategies to includedisaster preparedness, risk management, and contingency andresponse capacities according to the lessons of catastrophic floods.The Government of Mozambique introduced new DRM structuresbetween 2000 and 2007, illustrating the flexibility needed toaccommodate the scientific and communication systems that needto be in place to adapt to a climate change-driven disaster and thatthis can be done in liaison with and with guidance from externalagencies. Realization of the new program of DRM led to a reductionin consequences from the floods in 2007 (Republic of Mozambique,2006a).
• Experience in Mozambique shows that creation and development
of effective and steadily functioning systems of hydrologicalmonitoring and early warning systems at a local, regional, andnational level as key components of DRM allowing more realisticwarnings of flooding threats (WMO, 2011a).
• The implementation of resettlement programs in periodically flooded
areas in 2007 has reduced flood damage, but these measures arenot easy to implement (WMO, 2011a).
• Limited available resources are one of the most important problems
for both disaster preparedness and disaster response. The extremepoverty of the people makes them highly vulnerable to floods andother natural disasters, despite the best efforts of the governmentto protect them (World Bank, 2011b).
• The example of Mozambique shows that climate change adaptation
needs to be achieved through the understanding of vulnerability inall sectors (social, infrastructure, production, and environmental)and this knowledge needs to be used for the formulation ofpreparedness and response mechanisms (Sietz et al., 2008).
9.2.7. Disastrous Epidemic Disease: The Case of Cholera 
9.2.7.1. Introduction
Weather and climate have a wide range of health impacts and play a
role in the ecology of many infectious diseases (Patz et al., 2000). Therelationships between health and weather, climate variability, and long-term climate change are complex and often indirect (McMichael et al.,2006). As with other impacts explored in this report, not all extremehealth impacts associated with weather and climate result fromextreme events; some result instead from less dramatic events unfoldingin the context of high population vulnerability. In such cases, impactsChapter 9 Case Studies508are typically indirect and are mediated by a constellation of factors, as
opposed to the direct health impacts of severe weather, for example,traumatic injuries resulting directly from exposure to kinetic energyassociated with storms (Noji, 2000).
Commonly, underdeveloped health and other infrastructure, poverty,
political instability, and ecosystem disruptions interact with weather toimpact health adversely, sometimes to a disastrous degree (Myersand Patz, 2009). For example, cholera is an infectious disease that isperpetuated by poverty and associated factors, though outbreaks arecommonly associated with rainy season onset. Research in the lastdecade has demonstrated that cholera is also sensitive to climatevariability (Rodó et al., 2002; Koelle et al., 2005a; Constantin de Magnyet al., 2007). Assuming persistence of these vulnerability factors, choleraoutbreaks may become more widespread as the climate continues tochange (Lipp et al., 2002) due to the projected likely increase in frequency
of heavy precipitation over many areas of the globe, and tropicalregions in particular (see Table 3-1). Insights into the disease’s ecology,however, including its climate sensitivity, may one day inform early warningsystems and other interventions that could blunt its disastrous impact.Equally, if not more important, poverty reduction and improvements inengineering, critical infrastructure, and political stability and transparencycan reduce vulnerability among exposed populations to the degree thatcholera could be contained.
9.2.7.2. Background
Cholera has a long history as a human scourge. The world is in the midstof the seventh global pandemic, which began in Indonesia in 1961 andis distinguished by continued prevalence of the El Tor strain of the Vibrio
cholerae bacterium (Zuckerman et al., 2007; WHO, 2010). Primarily driven
by poor sanitation, cholera cases are concentrated in areas burdened bypoverty, inadequate sanitation, and poor governance. Between 1995 and2005, the heaviest burden was in Africa, where poverty, water sourcecontamination, heavy rainfall and floods, and population displacementwere the primary risk factors (Griffith et al., 2006).
V. cholerae is flexible and ecologically opportunistic, enabling it to cause
epidemic disease in a wide range of settings and in response to climateforcings (Koelle et al., 2005b). Weather, particularly seasonal rains, has
long been recognized as a risk factor for cholera epidemics.
Cholera is one of a handful of diseases whose incidence has been directly
associated with climate variability and long-term climate change (Rodóet al., 2002). One driver of cholera’s presence and pathogenicity is theEl Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which brings higher temperatures,
more intense precipitation, and enhanced cholera transmission. ENSO
has been associated with cholera outbreaks in coastal and inland
regions of Africa (Constantin de Magny et al., 2007), South Asia
(Constantin de Magny et al., 2007), and South America (Gil et al., 2004).
There is concern that climate change will work synergistically with
poverty and poor sanitation to increase cholera risk. As with other disasters, the risk of disastrous cholera epidemics can be
deconstructed into hazard probability, exposure probability, and populationvulnerability, which can be further broken down into populationsusceptibility and adaptive capacity. As noted in the introduction, somedisastrous cholera epidemics are not associated with discrete extremeweather events, but extreme impacts are triggered instead by exposureto a less dramatic weather event in the context of high populationvulnerability. We focus on factors affecting exposure and vulnerability ingeneral, then apply this discussion to the Zimbabwe cholera epidemicthat began in 2008.
9.2.7.2.1. Exposure
Cholera epidemics occur when susceptible human hosts are broughtinto contact with toxigenic strains of V. cholerae serogroup O1 or
serogroup O139. A host of ecological factors affect V. cholerae ’s
environmental prevalence and pathogenicity (Colwell, 2002) and thelikelihood of human exposure (Koelle, 2009). In coastal regions, there isa commensal relationship between V. cholerae , plankton, and algae
(Colwell, 1996). Cholera bacteria are attracted to the chitin of zooplanktonexoskeletons, which provide them with stability and protect them frompredators. The zooplankton feed on algae, which bloom in response toincreasing sunlight and warmer temperatures. When there are algalblooms in the Bay of Bengal, the zooplankton prosper and cholerapopulations grow, increasing the likelihood of human exposure.Precipitation levels, sea surface temperature, salinity, and factors affectingmembers of the marine and estuarine ecosystem, such as algae andcopepods, affect exposure probability (Huq et al., 2005). Many of thesefactors appear to be similar across regions, although their relativeimportance varies, such as the association of V. cholerae with chitin
(Pruzzo et al., 2008) and the importance of precipitation and sea level(Emch et al., 2008). For example, marine and estuarine sources were thesource of pathogenic V. cholerae strains responsible for cholera epidemics
in Mexico in recent El Niño years (Lizarraga-Partida et al., 2009). 
Other variables are associated with increased likelihood of exposure,
including conflict (Bompangue et al., 2009), population displacement,crowding (Shultz et al., 2009), and political instability (Shikanga et al.,2009). Many of these factors are actually mediated by the moreconventional cholera risk factors of poor sanitation and lack of accessto improved water sources and sewage treatment.
9.2.7.2.2. Population susceptibility
Population susceptibility includes both physiological factors that increasethe likelihood of infection after cholera exposure, as well as social andstructural factors that drive the likelihood of a severe, persistent epidemiconce exposure has occurred. Physiologic factors that affect cholera riskor severity include malnutrition and co-infection with intestinal parasites(Harris et al., 2009) or the bacterium Helicobacter pylori . Infections are
more severe for people with blood group O, for children, and for thoseChapter 9 Case Studies509with increased health-related vulnerability. Waxing and waning immu nity
as a result of prior exposure has a significant impact on populationvulnerability to cholera over long periods (Koelle et al., 2005b).
While physiologic susceptibility is important, social and economic drivers
of population susceptibility persistently seem to drive epidemic risk.Poverty is a strong predictor of risk on a population basis (Ackers et al.,1998; Talavera and Perez, 2009), and political factors, as illustrated bythe Zimbabwe epidemic, are often important drivers of epidemic severityand persistence once exposure occurs. Many recent severe epidemicsexhibit population susceptibility dynamics similar to Zimbabwe, includingin other poor communities (Hashizume et al., 2008), in the aftermathof political unrest (Shikanga et al., 2009), and following populationdisplacement (Bompangue et al., 2009).
9.2.7.2.3. Adaptive capacity
Cholera outbreaks are familiar sequelae of complex emergencies. TheDRM community has much experience with prevention efforts to reducethe likelihood of cholera epidemics, containing them once they occur,and reducing the associated morbidity and mortality among the infected.Best practices include guidelines for water treatment and sanitation andfor population-based surveillance (Sphere Project, 2004). 
9.2.7.3. Description of Event
Zimbabwe has had cholera outbreaks every year since 1998, with the2008 epidemic the worst the world had seen in two decades, affectingapproximately 92,000 people and killing over 4,000 (Mason, 2009). Theoutbreak began on 20 August 2008, slightly lagging the onset ofseasonal rains, in Chitungwiza city, just south of the capital Harare(WHO, 2008a). In the initial stages, several districts were affected. InOctober, the epidemic exploded in Harare’s Budiriro suburb and soonspread to include much of the country, persisting well into June 2009and ultimately seeding outbreaks in several other countries. Weatherappears to have been crucial in the outbreak, as recurrent point-sourcecontamination of drinking water sources (WHO, 2008a) was almostcertainly amplified by the onset of the rainy season (Luque Fernandez et
al., 2009). In addition to its size, this epidemic was distinguished by itsurban focus and relatively high case fatality rate (CFR; the proportion ofinfected people who die) ranging from 4 to 5% (Mason, 2009). Most
outbreaks have CFRs below 1% (Alajo et al., 2006). Underlying structural
vulnerability with shortages of medicines, equipment, and staff at
health facilities throughout the country compounded the effects of the
cholera epidemic (WHO, 2008b).
9.2.7.4. Intervention
There are several risk management considerations for preventing
cholera outbreaks and minimizing the likelihood that an outbreakbecomes a disastrous epidemic (Sack et al., 2006). Public health has a
wide range of interventions for preventing and containing outbreaks,and several other potentially effective interventions are in development(Bhattacharya et al., 2009). As is the case in managing all climate-sensitive risks, the role of institutional learning is becoming ever moreimportant in reducing the risk of cholera and other epidemic disease asthe climate shifts.
9.2.7.4.1. Conventional public health strategies
The conventional public health strategies for reducing cholera riskinclude a range of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies(Holmgren, 1981).
Primary prevention, or prevention of contact between a hazardous
exposure and susceptible host, includes promoting access to clean waterand reducing the likelihood of population displacement; secondaryprevention, or prevention of symptom development in an exposed host,includes vaccination; and tertiary prevention, or containment of symp toms
and prevention of complications once disease is manifest, includesdehydration treatment with oral rehydration therapy.
9.2.7.4.2. Newer developments
Enhanced understanding of cholera ecology has enabled developmentof predictive models that perform relatively well (Matsuda et al., 2008)and fostered hope that early warning systems based on remotely sensedtrends in sea surface temperature, algal growth, and other ecologicaldrivers of cholera risk can help reduce risks of epidemic disease,particularly in coastal regions (Mendelsohn and Dawson, 2008).Strategies to reduce physiologic susceptibility through vaccination haveshown promise (Calain et al., 2004; Chaignat et al., 2008; Lopez et al.,2008; Sur et al., 2009) and mass vaccination campaigns have potentialto interrupt epidemics (WHO, 2006c), and may be cost effective inresource-poor regions or for displaced populations where provision ofsanitation and other services has proven difficult (Jeuland andWhittington, 2009). Current World Health Organization policy on choleravaccination holds that vaccination should be used in conjunction withother control strategies in endemic areas and be considered forpopulations at risk for epidemic disease, and that cholera immunizationis a temporizing measure while more permanent sanitation improvementscan be pursued (WHO, 2010). Ultimately, given the strong associationwith poverty, continued focus on development may ultimately have thelargest impact on reducing cholera risk. 
9.2.7.5. Outcomes
Managing the risk of climate-sensitive disease, like risk management ofother climate-sensitive outcomes, will necessarily become more iterativeand adaptive as climate change shifts the hazard landscape andChapter 9 Case Studies510heightens vulnerability in certain populations. Learning is an important
component of this iterative process (see Sections 1.4 and 8.6.3.2).
There are multiple opportunities for learning to enhance risk manage ment
related to epidemic disease. First, while reactive containment processescan be essential for identifying and containing outbreaks, this approachoften glosses over root causes in an effort to return to the status quo.As the World Health Organization states, “Current responses to choleraoutbreaks are reactive, taking the form of a more or less well-organizedemergency response,” and prevention is lacking (WHO, 2006c). Withoutlosing the focus on containment, institutional learning could incorporatestrategies to address root causes, reducing the likelihood of futureoutbreaks. This includes continued efforts to better understand cholera’shuman ecology to explore deeper assumptions, structures, and policydecisions that shape how risks are constructed. In the case of cholera,such exploration has opened the possibility of devising warning systemsand other novel risk management strategies. Another equally importantconclusion – one that experts on climate’s role in driving cholera riskhave emphasized (Pascual et al., 2002) – is that poverty and politicalinstability are the fundamental drivers of cholera risk, and that emphasison development and justice are risk management interventions as well.
9.2.7.6. Lessons Identified
The 2008 cholera epidemic epitomized the complex interactionsbetween weather events and population vulnerability that can interactto produce disastrous epidemic disease. Recent studies of cholera,including its basic and human ecology, demonstrate the potential forearly warning and potential points of leverage that may be useful forinterventions to contain future epidemics. The key messages from thiswork include:
•Variability in precipitation and temperature can  affect importantepidemic diseases such as cholera both through direct effects onthe transmission cycle, but also potentially through indirect effects,for example through problems arising from inadequate basic waterand sanitation services.
•If other determinants remained constant, climate change would be
expected to increase risk by increasing exposure likelihood –
through increased variability in precipitation and gradually rising
temperatures and by increasing population vulnerability. 
•The health impacts of cholera epidemics are strongly mediated
through individual characteristics such as age and immunity, and
population-level social determinants, such as poverty, governance,
and infrastructure. 
•Experience from multiple cholera epidemics demonstrates that
non-climatic factors can either exacerbate or override the effects of
weather or other infection hazards.
•The processes of DRM and preventive public health are closely
linked, and largely synonymous. Strengthening and integrating
these measures, alongside economic development, should increase
resilience against the health effects of extreme weather and gradualclimate change.9.2.8. Coastal Megacities: The Case of Mumbai
9.2.8.1. Introduction
In July 2005, Mumbai, India, was struck by an exceptional storm (Revi,
2005). In one 24-hour span alone, the city received 94 cm of rain, andthe storm left more than 1,000 dead, mostly in slum settlements (DeSherbinin et al., 2007; Sharma and Tomar, 2010). A week of heavy rain
disrupted water, sewer, drainage, road, rail, air transport, power, andtelecommunications systems (Revi, 2005). As a result of this ‘synchronous
failure,’ Mumbai-based automated teller machine banking systems ceasedworking across much of the country, and the Bombay and NationalStock Exchanges were temporarily forced to close (Revi, 2005; UNISDR,2011b). This demonstrates that within megacities, risk and loss are bothconcentrated and also spread through networks of critical infrastructureas well as connected economic and other systems.
9.2.8.2. Background
At present, Mumbai is the city with the largest population exposed tocoastal flooding – estimated at 2,787,000 currently, and projected toincrease to more than 11 million people exposed by 2070 (Hanson etal., 2011). During that same period, exposed assets are expected toincrease from US$ 46.2 billion to nearly US$ 1.6 trillion (Hanson et al.,2011). 
Mumbai’s significant, and increasing, exposure of people and assets –
both within the urban fabric but also outside, connected to the city’sfunctions through networks of critical infrastructure, financial, andresource flows – will be affected by changes in climate means andclimate extremes (Nicholls et al., 2007; Revi, 2008; Fuchs et al., 2011;Ranger et al., 2011). It is difficult to associate a single extreme eventwith climate change, but it may be possible to discuss the changedprobability of an event’s occurrence in relation to a particular cause,such as global warming (see FAQ 3.2). For the Indian monsoon, forexample, extreme rain events have an increasing trend between 1901and 2005, with the trend being stronger since 1950 (see Section 3.4.1). 
9.2.8.3. Description of Vulnerability
Attributing causes of changes in monsoons is difficult due to substantialdifferences between models, and the observed maximum rainfall onIndia’s west coast, where Mumbai is located, is poorly simulated bymany models (see Section 3.4.1). That being said, increases in precipitationare projected for the Asian monsoon, along with increased interannualseasonally averaged precipitation variability (see Section 3.4.1).
Furthermore, extreme sea levels can be expected to change in the future
as a result of mean sea level rise and changes in atmospheric storminess,and it is very likely that sea level rise will contribute to increases in
extreme sea levels in the future (see Section 3.5.3). Chapter 9 Case Studies511The development failures that have led to an accumulation of disaster
risk in Mumbai and allowed its transmission beyond the urban core arecommon to many other large urban centers. The IPCC FourthAssessment Report (AR4) stated with very high confidence that the
impact of climate change on coasts is exacerbated by increasinghuman-induced pressures, with subsequent studies being consistent
with this assessment (see Section 3.5.5).
The AR4 also reported with very high confidence that coasts will be
exposed to increasing risks, including coastal erosion, over comingdecades due to climate change and sea level rise, both of which will beexacerbated by increasing human-induced pressures (see Section 3.5.5). 
The July 2005 flooding in Mumbai underscores the fact that coastal
megacities are already at risk due to climate-related hazards (DeSherbinin et al., 2007; McGranahan et al., 2007). Refuse and debriscommonly clog storm drains, causing flooding even on the higherground in Mumbai’s slums, and landslides are another threat to squattercommunities that are near or on the few hillsides in the city (De Sherbininet al., 2007). Urban poor populations often experience increased ratesof infectious disease after flood events, and after the July 2005 floodsthe prevalence of leptospirosis rose eightfold in Mumbai (Maskey et al.,2006; Kovats and Akhtar, 2008).
To the present, drivers of flood risk have been largely driven by
socioeconomic processes and factors, such as poverty, ecosystemdegradation, and poorly governed rapid urbanization (Revi, 2005, 2008;De Sherbinin et al., 2007; Huq et al., 2007; UNISDR, 2009c, 2011b;Hanson et al., 2011; Ranger et al., 2011). These processes are interrelated,and within these cities, vulnerability is concentrated in the poorestneighborhoods, which often lack access to sanitation, health care, andtransportation infrastructure, and whose homes and possessions areunprotected by insurance (Revi, 2005; De Sherbinin et al., 2007; UNISDR,2009c; Ranger et al., 2011). 
Slum settlements are often located in sites with high levels of risk due
to environmental and social factors. For example, they are often locatedin floodplains or on steep slopes, which means their residents suffer froma considerable degree of physical exposure and social vulnerability tolosses from flood events (Huq et al., 2007; McGranahan et al., 2007;Chatterjee, 2010).
Mumbai is one of many coastal megacities that have been built in part
on reclaimed land, a process that increases flood risks to low-lying
areas where slums are frequently located (Chatterjee, 2010). Its slums
do not benefit from structural flood protection measures and are located
in low-lying areas close to marshes and other marginal places andare frequently flooded during monsoon season, especially when heavy
rainfall occurs during high tides (McGranahan et al., 2007; Chatterjee,
2010). A rise in sea level of 50 cm, together with storm surges, wouldrender uninhabitable the coastal and low-lying areas (De Sherbinin et
al., 2007) where many of Mumbai’s informal settlements are currently
located.9.2.8.4. Outcomes/Consequences
India’s 2001 census indicated that in Mumbai 5,823,510 people (48.9%of the population) lived in slums (Government of India, 2001). In 2005,the global slum population was nearly 1 billion, and it is projectedto reach 1.3 to 1.4 billion by 2020, mostly concentrated in cities in
developing countries (UN-HABITAT, 2006). In addition to Mumbai,
Hanson et al. (2011) found that the following cities will have the greatestpopulation exposure to coastal flooding in 2070: Kolkata, Dhaka,Guangzhou, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Bangkok, Rangoon, Miami, andHai Phòng. Many of these cities are already characterized by significantpopulation and asset exposure to coastal flooding, and all but Miamiare located in developing countries in Asia. 
Africa does not have a large share of the world’s biggest coastal cities
but most of its largest cities are on the coast and large sections of theirpopulation are at risk from flooding (Awuor et al., 2008; Adelekan, 2010).Compared to Asia, Europe, and the Americas, a greater percentage ofAfrica’s population lives in coastal cities of 100,000 to 5 million people,which is noteworthy because Africa’s medium-to-large cities tend to bepoor and many are growing at much higher rates than cities on theother continents (McGranahan et al., 2007).
The amount of vulnerability concentrated within these cities will define
their risks, and in the absence of adaptation there is high confidence
that locations currently experiencing adverse effects, such as coastalerosion and inundation, will continue to do so in the future (see Section3.5.5).
However, there is a certain limit to adaptation given that these cities are
fixed in place and some degree of exposure to hazards is ‘locked in’ dueto the unlikelihood of relocation (Hanson et al., 2011). For example, India’slarge infrastructure investments, which have facilitated Mumbai’ s rapid
growth, were built to last 50 to 150 years (Revi, 2008). This foreclosessome adaptation and DRR strategies, such as risk avoidance.Furthermore, all large coastal cities are centers of high populationdensity, infrastructure, investments, networking, and information(McGranahan et al., 2007; Chatterjee, 2010). This concentration andconnectivity make them important sources of innovation and economicgrowth, especially in developing countries where these ingredients maybe absent elsewhere. This underscores the importance of governanceand economic relations, including insurance and more general basicneeds of health and education, in allowing urban systems and those atrisk to build resilience if they cannot avoid hazard.
9.2.8.5. Lessons Identified
Measures to reduce exposure to existing weather-related hazards canalso serve as means of adapting to climate change (McGranahan et al.,2007; UNISDR, 2009c, 2011b; Chapters 1 and 2). At the time of the2005 flood, Mumbai lacked the capacity to address a complex portfolioof (interrelated) risks (De Sherbinin et al., 2007; Revi, 2008), and itsChapter 9 Case Studies512multi-hazard risk plan from 2000 was not well implemented (Revi,
2005). Risk protection in most other megacities in developing countrieswas also found to be more informal than robust (Hanson et al., 2011).Multi-hazard risk models, based on probabilistic analysis, can helpgovernments better reduce risks and facilitate better management ofand preparedness for risks that cannot be reduced cost effectively(Revi, 2008; Ranger et al., 2011; UNISDR, 2011b).
Given that up to US$ 35 trillion (approximately 9% of projected global
GDP) may be exposed to climate-related hazards in port cities by 2070(in purchasing power parity, 2001 US$) (Hanson et al., 2011), managing– and reducing – these risks represents a high-leverage policy area foradaptation. The scale of economic assets at risk is impressive and tothis must be added the livelihoods and health of the poor that may bedisproportionately impacted by disaster events but have partial visibilityin macroeconomic assessments.
The need to adapt is especially acute in developing countries in Asia
given that 14 of the top 20 urban agglomerations projected to have thegreatest exposure of assets in 2070 are in developing countries in thisregion (Hanson et al., 2011). This suggests that scaled-up financing foradaptation may be needed to safeguard the residents and economicactivity in these cities to a level comparable to that of other coastalmegacities that face similar population and asset exposure, such asNew York or Tokyo. Two critical distinctions are the degree of povertyand the less complete reach of local government in those cities most atrisk.
Despite efforts to assess the impacts of climate change at the city scale,
analysis of the economic impacts of climate change at this scale hasreceived relatively little attention to date (Hallegatte and Corfee-Morlot, 2011). In developing countries, the sometimes incompleteunderstanding of climate risks and the limited institutional capacityhave meant that analysis of climate change impacts at the city scale hasgenerally considered only flood risks and not yet assessed additionalpotential impacts (Hunt and Watkiss, 2011). A standardized, multi-hazard impact analysis at the city scale would be useful and facilitatecomparisons between cities (Hunt and Watkiss, 2011). 
9.2.9. Small Island Developing States:
The Challenge of Adaptation
9.2.9.1. Introduction 
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are defined as those that are small
island nations, have low-lying coastal zones, and share development
challenges (UNCTAD, 2004). Strengthening of SIDS technical capacities
to enable resilience building has been recommended (UNESC, 2011). 
This case study explores the critical vulnerabilities of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands (RMI). Additional data from the Maldives, also highlyvulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather events and where thetsunami caused significant damage, and Grenada, which is a country
with a small open economy vulnerable to external shocks and naturaldisasters, are used to develop the full context of the limits of adaptation.Specifically, the RMI highlights the availability of fresh water as a majorconcern. “There is strong evidence that under most climate changescenarios, water resources in small islands are likely to be seriouslycompromised ( very high confidence )” (Mimura et al., 2007).
9.2.9.2. Background
SIDS can be particularly vulnerable to hazards and face difficulties when
responding to disasters (TDB, 2007). SIDS share similar developmentchallenges including small but growing populations, economicdependence on international funders, and lack of resources (e.g.,
freshwater, land) (World Bank, 2005b; UNFCCC, 2007a). The IPCC
(Mimura et al., 2007) concluded that “small islands, whether located inthe tropics or higher latitudes, have characteristics which make themespecially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, sea level rise, andextreme events ( very high confidence ).” Many SIDS share vulnerabilities
with high levels of poverty and are reported to suffer seriousenvironmental degradation and to have weak human and institutionalcapacities for land management that is integrated and sustainable (GEF ,2006). The range of physical resources available to states influences theiroptions to cope with disasters and the relatively restricted economicdiversity intrinsic to SIDS minimizes their capacity to respond inemergencies with measures such as shelter or evacuation (Boruff andCutter, 2007). Hence SIDS are among the most vulnerable states to theimpacts of climate change (UNFCCC, 2007b). As of 2010, 38 UN membernations and 14 non-UN Members/Associate Members of the RegionalCommissions were classified as SIDS (UN-OHRLLS, 2011). 
The RMI provides an example of critical vulnerabilities. It is made up of
five islands and 29 atolls that are spread across more than 1.9 millionsquare kilometers of Pacific Ocean (World Bank, 2006a). The countryhas a population of 64,522, approximately two-thirds of which isconcentrated in urban areas on just two atolls (UNDESA, 2010; WorldBank, 2011b). The other one-third live on the even more remote outerislands and atolls (World Bank, 2006a). Even the main inhabited islandsremain extremely isolated; the nearest major port is over 4,500 km fromMajuro, the capital atoll (World Bank, 2005b).
The Maldives and Grenada both provide other examples of vulnerability
to extreme events and disasters and climate change adaptation needs: 
•The Maldives consist of 1,192 small islands. 80% are 1 m or lessabove sea level (Quarless, 2007), of which only three islands have asurface area of more than 500 ha (De Comarmond and Payet, 2010).These characteristics make them highly vulnerable to damage fromsea level rise and extreme weather events. The economic andsurvival challenges of the people of the Maldives were evidentafter the 2004 tsunami caused damage equivalent to 62% of
national GDP (World Bank, 2005c). As of 2009, the country still
faced a deficit of more than US$ 150 million for reconstruction.Chapter 9 Case Studies513Such devastation in a SIDS might be countered with further disaster
preparation and efforts to maintain emergency funds to rebuildtheir economies (De Comarmond and Payet, 2010). 
•Grenada is a small tri-island state in the Eastern Caribbean with apopulation of 102,000 and a per capita GDP of US$ 4,601 in 2004(IMF , 2011). It is a small open economy, vulnerable to externalshocks and natural disasters as seen by the effects of HurricaneIvan, which created large fiscal and balance of payments financingneeds in 2004, and Hurricane Emily, which struck in 2005 (IMF , 2004,2006). Hurricane Ivan brought major disruption to an economicrecovery process, eventually costing the island an estimated US$ 3billion (Boruff and Cutter, 2007). It is projected that Ivan reducedthe country’s forecasted growth rate from 5.7% to -1.4% (Quarless,2007). Hurricane Emily followed 10 months later, virtually completingthe trail of destruction started by Ivan. The impact was seen inevery sector of the economy. Capital stock was severely damagedand employment was significantly affected (UNDP , 2006). 
9.2.9.3. Description of Vulnerability 
Many SIDS face specific disadvantages associated with their small size,insularity, remoteness, and susceptibility to natural hazards. SIDS areparticularly vulnerable to climate change because their key economicsectors such as agriculture, fisheries, and tourism are all susceptible(Barnett and Adger, 2003; Read, 2010) (a more extensive discussion isprovided in Chapter 4, especially Sections 4.2.1, 4.4.4, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3).The hazards of extreme weather events are coupled with other long-term climate change impacts, especially sea level rise (see Box 3-4).Low-lying atoll communities, such as the Maldives and Cook Islands, areespecially vulnerable (Ebi et al., 2006; Woodroffe, 2008; Kelman andWest, 2009) and are expected to lose significant portions of land(Mimura et al., 2007). Small island states and particularly atoll countriesmay experience erosion, inundation, and saline intrusion resulting inecosystem disruption, decreased agricultural productivity, changes indisease patterns, economic losses, and population displacement – all ofwhich reinforce vulnerability to extreme weather events (Pernetta,1992; Nurse and Sem, 2001; Mimura et al., 2007).
SIDS suffer higher relative economic losses from natural hazards and
are less resilient to those losses so that one extreme event may have theeffect of countering years of development gains (UN, 2005; Kelman, 2010).The distances between many SIDS and economic centers make their
populations among the most isolated in the world (World Bank, 2005b).
Underdevelopment and susceptibility to disasters are mutually reinforcing:
disasters not only cause heavy losses to capital assets, but also disruptproduction and the flow of goods and services in the affected economy,
resulting in a loss of earnings (Pelling et al., 2002). In both the short andthe long term, those impacts can have sharp repercussions on the
economic development of a country, affecting GDP , public finances, andforeign trade, thus increasing levels of poverty and public debt
(Mirza, 2003; Ahrens and Rudolph, 2006). Climate change threatens toexacerbate existing vulnerabilities and hinder socioeconomic develop ment
(UNFCCC, 2007b).
The RMI faces major climate-related natural hazards including sea level
rise, tropical storms or typhoons with associated storm surges, anddrought. These hazards should be considered within the context ofadditional hazards and challenges such as ecosystem degradation,pollution of the marine environment, and coastal erosion as well asfood security. The RMI faces physical and economic challenges thatamplify the population’s vulnerability to climate hazards, including highpopulation density, high levels of poverty, low elevation, and fragilefreshwater resources (World Bank, 2011b). The Global Facility for DisasterReduction and Recovery report concludes that the hazard that poses themost threat is sea level rise, as the highest point on RMI is only 10 mabove sea level (World Bank, 2011b). Consequently, multilateral donorsconsidered the RMI ‘high risk’ and the Global Facility for DisasterReduction and Recovery has identified it as a priority country forassistance (World Bank, 2011b).
9.2.9.4. Outcomes/Consequences
A range of both local and donor-supported actions have endeavored tobuild resilience among SIDS. The example of the RMI shows the benefitsthat risk reduction and climate change adaptation efforts may offerother island states. 
Freshwater availability is a major concern for many SIDS (Quarless,
2007), including the RMI. Since SIDS are especially vulnerable toextreme weather events, their water supplies face rapid salinization dueto seawater intrusion and contamination (PSIDS, 2009). According toone study, countries such as the RMI lack the financial and technicalresources to implement seawater desalination for their populations(UNDESA, 2011). Some disaster and climate risk management gainsmay come from simple technology (UNDESA, 2010). New scavengertechnology for wells has been introduced (UNESC, 2004) as one of theways forward. Simple abstraction of freshwater from thin groundwaterlenses (a typical practice in oceanic atolls) often results in upward coningof saltwater, which, in turn, causes contamination of the water supplies.The RMI has benefited from its use of new, pioneering technology tolimit the effects of extreme weather events on its water supply (UNDESA,2011). The improvement of climate sensitivity knowledge, particularly inthe context of risk management, is key to adaptation to climate change.Climate and disaster risk are closely entwined and, for example,resilience to drought and resilience to climate change both stand to beenhanced through a single targeted program. 
In addition to project-oriented development assistance, the RMI
receives substantial financial assistance from the United States througha Compact of Free Association (Nuclear Claims Tribunal, Republic of theMarshall Islands, 2007). Grants and budget support provided underCompact I over the period of 1987 to 2001 totaled an average of over30% of GDP , not including any other form of bilateral assistance (WorldChapter 9 Case Studies514Bank, 2005b). The RMI stands out among other lower middle income
countries, receiving average aid per capita of US$ 1,183, compared withthe average of US$ 8 for other lower middle income countries (WorldBank, 2005b). This assistance, buttressed by national disaster manage ment
policies dating back to the RMI’s independence in 1986 and includingthe Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery’s role in assessing
the RMI’s systems and noting existing gaps for future developmentpartner projects, has resulted in a range of national and regional disasterand climate risk management initiatives (World Bank, 2009, 2011b).
9.2.9.5. Lessons Identified
The physical, social, and economic characteristics by which SIDS anddeveloping countries are defined (education, income, and health, forexample) increase their vulnerability to extreme climate events.Experiences from the Marshall Islands, the Maldives, and Grenadaindicate that limited freshwater supplies and inadequate drainageinfrastructure are key vulnerability factors. These examples also indicatean important difference between risk of frequent smaller hazards andcatastrophic risk of infrequent but extreme events. 
The cases of Grenada and the Maldives demonstrate the high relative
financial impact that a hazard can have on a small island state. Forthe RMI, financial support from donors has enabled a range of riskmanagement programs. Although the importance of disaster riskreduction strategies is apparent, preventive approaches continue toreceive less emphasis than disaster relief and recovery (Davies et al., 2008).Considering the range of challenges facing policymakers in some SIDS,preventive climate adaptation policies can seem marginal comparedwith pressing issues of poverty, affordable energy, affordable food,transportation, health care, and economic development. 
National policymaking in this context remains a major challenge and
availability of funding for preventive action – such as disaster and cli mate
risk management – may continue to be limited for many countries
(Ahmad and Ahmed, 2002; Jegillos, 2003; Huq et al., 2006; Yohe et al.,
2007). Although most developing countries participate in various
international protocols and conventions relating to climate change and
sustainable development and most have adopted national environmentalconservation and natural disaster management policies (Yohe et al.,
2007), the policy agendas of many developing countries do not yet fully
address all aspects of climate change (Beg et al., 2002). 
9.2.10. Changing Cold Climate Vulnerabilities:
Northern Canada
9.2.10.1. Introduction 
In cold climate regions all over the world, climate change is occurring
more rapidly than over most of the globe (Anisimov et al., 2007). These
changes have implications for the built environment. The vulnerability ofresidents of the Canadian North is complex and dynamic. In addition to
the increasing risks from extreme weather events, there are climateimpacts upon travel, food security, and infrastructural integrity, which inturn affect many other aspects of everyday life (Pearce et al., 2009; Fordet al., 2010). Additionally, the relative isolation of these northern
communities makes exposure to climate-related risk more difficult toadapt to, thus increasing their level of vulnerability (Ford and Pearce,
2010). This case study will examine the increased vulnerabilities inregions of the Canadian North due to climate change’s effect oninfrastructure through changes in permafrost thaw and snow loading.The study illustrates existing and projected risks and governmentalresponses to them at the municipal, provincial/territorial, and nationallevels. Canada has three territories: the Yukon (YT); the NorthwestTerritories (NWT); and Nunavut (NU); this study deals with all three and,to a much lesser extent, the northern regions of the provinces, such asNunavik in northern Quebec. Though both permafrost thaw andchanging snow loads are slowly progressing events, as opposed to one-time extreme events, their impacts can result in disasters. Futureprotection relies upon risk reduction and adaptation. Sections 3.3.1 and3.5.7 discuss changes in cold extremes and other climate variables athigh latitudes.
9.2.10.2. Background
Over the past few decades, the northern regions of Canada haveexperienced a rate of warming about twice that of the rest of the world(McBean et al., 2005; Field et al., 2007; Furgal and Prowse, 2008). Innorthern Canada, winter temperatures are expected to rise by between3.5 and 12.5°C by 2080, with smaller changes projected for spring andsummer; in more southerly regions of northern Canada, temperaturescould warm to be above freezing for much longer periods (Furgal andProwse, 2008). For example, whereas it was estimated that theNorthwest Passage would be navigable for ice-strengthened cargoships in 2050 (Instanes et al., 2005), it has already been navigable in2007 (Barber et al., 2008). Recent studies have suggested that somecommunities in northern Canada will be vulnerable to the acceleratedrate of climate change (Ford and Smit, 2004; Ford and Furgal, 2009).
Higher temperatures have several implications for infrastructure that
plays an important role in maintaining the social and economic functionsof a community (CSA, 2010). Permafrost thaw and changing snowloads have the potential to affect the structural stability of essentialinfrastructure (Nelson et al., 2002; Couture and Pollard, 2007). Designstandards in northern Canada were based on permafrost and snow loadlevels of a previous climate regime (CSA, 2010). Adaptation is essentialto avoid higher operational and maintenance costs for structures and toensure that the designed long lifespan of each structure remains viable(Allard et al., 2002). Addressing these impacts of climate change is acomplex task. Naturally each structure will be differently affected andthe resulting damage can exacerbate existing weaknesses and createnew vulnerabilities. For example, although increasing snow loadsalone can have negative impacts on infrastructure, the fact that manyChapter 9 Case Studies515buildings have been structurally weakened by permafrost thaw adds to
the damage potential during any snow event (CSA, 2010). 
9.2.10.3. Description of Vulnerability 
9.2.10.3.1. Permafrost thaw
Permafrost thaw is one of the leading factors increasing climate-related
vulnerability. Permafrost is by definition dependent on a sub-zerotemperature to maintain its state (CSA, 2010; NRCAN, 2011a). With achanging climate, it is difficult to predict where permafrost is most likely
to thaw, but about half of Canada’s permafrost zones are sensitive to
small, short-term increases in temperature, compromising the ability ofthe ground to support infrastructure (Nielson, 2007; NRTEE, 2009; CSA,2010). The rate of thaw (and hence implications for infrastructure stability)is also dependent on soil type within the permafrost zone (Nielson,2007). Areas that have ice-rich soil are much more likely to be affectedthan those with a lower ice-soil ratio or those that are underlain bybedrock (Nelson et al., 2002). Municipalities in discontinuous or sporadicpermafrost zones may feel the impacts of a warming climate moreintensely since the permafrost is thinner than it would be in continuouszones where ice has built up over time (Nelson et al., 2002).
Though some infrastructure maintenance will always be required, cli mate-
related permafrost thaw will increase the needs for infrastructuremaintenance and the rate of damage that is inflicted (Allard et al., 2002).Permafrost thaw affects different types of infrastructure in radicallydifferent ways. In northern Canada, municipalities have experiencedmany different climate-related impacts on physical infrastructureincluding the following (Infrastructure Canada, 2006; Nielson, 2007;NRTEE, 2009):
•Nunavik, in northern Quebec, reported that local roads and airportrunways have suffered from severe erosion, heaving, buckling, andsplitting (Nielson, 2007; Fortier et al., 2011).
•In Iqaluit, in Nunavut, 59 houses have required foundation repairand/or restoration and buildings with shallow foundation systemshave been identified as needing attention in the near future
(Nielson, 2007). In Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories, a recent
study estimated that 75% of the buildings in the municipality
would experience structural damage (Bastedo, 2007) depending
on the rate of permafrost thaw.
•The Tibbitt to Contwoyto winter road (Northwest Territories)experienced climate-related closures in 2006, remaining open for
only 42 days compared to 76 in 2005 (Bastedo, 2007). This resultedin residents and businesses having to airlift materials to theircommunities instead. In particular, the Diavik Diamond Mine wasforced to spend millions of dollars flying in materials (Bastedo,2007; Governments of Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon,
2010).
•The Northwest Territories reported that the airport runway in
Yellowknife required extensive retrofitting when the permafrost
below it began to thaw (Infrastructure Canada, 2006).The impacts of permafrost thaw on infrastructure have implications for
the health, economic livelihood, and safety of northern Canadiancommunities. The costs of repairing and installing technologies to adaptto climate change in existing infrastructure can range from severalmillion to many billions of dollars, depending on the extent of thedamage and the type of infrastructure that is at risk (InfrastructureCanada, 2006). Lessons from municipalities in the United States haveproven that these costs can be large. For instance, while the Yukonhad financial difficulties with CDN$ 4,000 km
-1yr-1costs related to
permafrost damage to highways, Alaska is experiencing costs of up toCDN$ 30,000 km
-1yr-1for an annual cost of over CDN$ 6 million over
a 200-km stretch (Governments of Northwest Territories, Nunavut, andYukon, 2010). In the future, as infrastructure needs to be replaced, costswill multiply rapidly (Larsen et al., 2008). 
9.2.10.3.2. Snow loading 
In most northern Canadian communities, buildings and roadways arebuilt using historical snow load standards (Nielson, 2007; Auld, 2008).This makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change since snowloads are expected to increase with higher levels of winter precipitation(Christensen et al., 2007; NRTEE, 2009). Already in the NorthwestTerritories, 10% of public access buildings have been retrofitted since2004 to address critical structural malfunctions. An additional 12% ofbuildings are on high alert for snow load-related roof collapse (Auld etal., 2010). In Inuvik, NWT, a local school suffered a complete roof collapseunder a particularly heavy snowfall (Bastedo, 2007). As permafrostcontinues to thaw, resulting in a loss of overall structural integrity, greaterimpacts will be linked to the increase in snow loads as previouslyweakened or infirm structures topple under larger or heavier snowfalls.
9.2.10.4. Outcomes
In response to these vulnerabilities, government and community leadershave put emphasis on action and preparedness (Government of NorthwestTerritories, 2008; Governments of Northwest Territories, Nunavut, andYukon, 2010). The social impacts of relocating communities or completerestoration after a major disaster, as well as the financial costs, providea strong deterrent to complacency and relocation will be utilized wherenecessary as a last resort (USARC, 2003). Though each government tier,from federal to municipal levels, tackles the issue from a different angle,their approaches are proving complementary as is demonstrated below.This section explores adaptation efforts from each level of governmentand the contribution they make to adaptive capacity in northernCanadian communities.
9.2.10.4.1. Federal level
The Canadian government contributes to numerous adaptation effortsat different levels and through various programs (Lemmen et al., 2008).Chapter 9 Case Studies516Some federal-level climate change adaptation programs are reactive; for
example, at the most basic level, the federal government is responsiblefor the provision of assistance after a disaster or in order to relocatestructures and communities (Henstra and McBean, 2005). Other pro grams
are more proactive, designed to prevent disasters from occurring; forexample, climate change is currently being incorporated into the 2015
version of the National Building Code (Environment Canada, 2010),which would help ensure that future infrastructure is built to a moreappropriate standard and that adaptive measures are incorporated intothe design and building of any new infrastructure. This could also helpensure that adaptation measures are implemented in a uniform wayacross the country.
In addition, several federal-level departments have programs specially
designed to prevent damage from climate-related impacts. As part ofthe Climate Change Adaptation Program offered by the Aboriginal Affairsand Northern Development Canada, the Assisting Northerners in AssessingKey Vulnerabilities and Opportunities helps to support aboriginal andnorthern communities, organizations and territories in addressing theurgent climate-related risks (INAC, 2010). For example, the programoffers risk assessments for existing infrastructure, water quality, andmanagement programs and helps to identify new infrastructure designsto reduce risk from climate change (INAC, 2010).
Similarly, the Regional Adaptation Collaborative (RAC) funding provided
by Natural Resources Canada was designed to assist communities thatare adapting to climate change (NRCAN, 2011b). The Northern RACinitiatives are focused on identifying vulnerabilities in the mining sector.Permafrost thaw and snow loading are examples of factors that theprogram will examine (NRCAN, 2011b). 
Another adaptation initiative that has come from the federal level is the
site selection guidelines developed by the Canadian StandardsAssociation (CSA, 2010). Though voluntary, this set of guidelinesencourages engineers, land use planners, and developers to considerenvironmental factors including the rate of permafrost thaw and type ofsoil when building (CSA, 2010). Additionally, it strongly encourages theuse of projections and models in the site selection process, instead of
relying on extrapolated weather trends (CSA, 2010). 
Similarly, federal-level design requirements such as the Canadian
environmental assessment process are required to account for climate
change in the design phase of significant new projects such as tailings
containment, water retention, pipelines, or roads (Furgal and Prowse,2008). Facilitating use of the guidelines and environmental assessment
requirements are proactive responses that aim to prevent futurepermafrost-related damage to infrastructure.
9.2.10.4.2. Provincial/territorial level
The territorial governments are contributing to the protection of
infrastructure in several ways, including conducting and fundingresearch to identify vulnerable areas and populations (INAC, 2010). The
Yukon transportation department has undertaken several adaptationinitiatives including the design and implementation of road embankmentsto minimize melting; construction of granular blankets on ice-rich slopesto provide for stability and to prevent major slope failure; and theinstallation of culverts in thawed streambeds (Government of Yukon,2010). Ground-penetrating radar and resistivity to assess permafrostconditions underground are being used in Nunavik, Quebec (Fortier et al.,2011). To protect existing permafrost, light-colored pavement on roadwaysis being used to reflect greater amounts of sunlight and prevent heatabsorption (Walsh et al., 2009). Collaborations with federal-leveldepartments to address community infrastructure resilience are beingconducted with, for example, the Nunavut Climate Change Partnership,which involves the Government of Nunavut, Natural Resources Canada,Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, and the CanadianInstitute of Planners (NRCAN, 2011c). These programs help communitiesto develop action plans that detail suitable options for addressing issuesrelated to climate change. The Yukon government is providing fundingfor municipalities to develop their own climate change adaptation plansthrough the Northern Strategy Trust Fund to the Northern ClimateExChange (Government of Yukon, 2009).
About 85 flat-loop thermosyphons, a sort of ground-source heat pump,
which extract heat from the ground (through convection) during thewinter and reduce thawing, have been constructed in territorial-ownedbuildings including schools and hospitals, prisons, and visitor centers inNunavut, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon (Holubec, 2008; CSA,2010). The installation of thermosyphon technology is not, in itself, a long-term strategy but merely prolongs the lifetime of most infrastructures(CSA, 2010). Finally, screw jack foundations, a technology that helps tostabilize vulnerable foundations and has been used to prevent damagedue to permafrost thaw and related shifting of house foundations, havebeen implemented in new buildings built by the Northwest TerritoriesHousing Corporation (Government of Northwest Territories, 2008). 
9.2.10.4.3. Municipal level
The municipal level is often most involved in building adaptive capacityand implementing adaptation strategies (Black et al., 2010) becausemunicipal governments feel the effects of damaged infrastructure morekeenly than higher levels of government (Richardson, 2010).Municipalities, community groups, and businesses all over the threeterritories have contributed in many ways. Some examples include:
•Urban planning and design are being used to reduce exposure towind and snowdrifts as well as minimize heat loss from buildingsin Iqaluit, NU (NRCAN, 2010).
•Insulated lining was placed underneath a 100-m section of runwayto prevent damage from permafrost thaw in Yellowknife, NWT(Infrastructure Canada, 2006).
•Ice-rich soil under important infrastructure has been replaced withgravel and heat-absorbing pavement in Yellowknife, NWT(Bastedo, 2007).Chapter 9 Case Studies517•Wind deflection fins are being used to prevent snow loading on
roofs and obstructions around exits in NWT (Waechter, 2005).
•In Tuktoyaktuk, NWT, important buildings, including the policestation and a school at risk of severe damage or loss have beenmoved inland (Governments of Northwest Territories, Nunavut, andYukon, 2010) and concrete mats bound together with chains arebeing used to limit erosion (Johnson et al., 2003).
•Shims or pillars to elevate buildings are being used to make themless vulnerable to permafrost thaw (USARC, 2003).
•Construction of new bridges and all-weather roads to replace iceroads that are no longer stable is underway (Infrastructure Canada,2006).
9.2.10.5. Lessons Identified 
Northern Canada can be considered a vulnerable region given theexpected climate-related risks. As the climate continues to warm in theNorth, infrastructure in many remote communities will become morevulnerable as well.
More research, especially into vulnerabilities in northern regions of the
globe, and the identification of adaptation options for establishedcommunities would be of benefit for adaptation. Additionally, whilegovernmental programs and support are available, a significant portionof it has been devoted to adaptation planning and strategizing. Animportant issue is the funding needed to help northern Canadiancommunities implement adaptation actions.
Finally, codes and standards are an integral part of addressing climate
impacts on infrastructure. Given the importance of this task, buildingcodes in vulnerable regions need more review and attention to protectcommunities. An evaluation and monitoring program that focuses oncodes and structures as well as adaptation options is noticeably lacking.Despite the complexity of these risks, however, a concerted effort fromthree tiers of government and community can work to reduce thevulnerability of infrastructure and northern communities. 
9.2.11. Early Warning Systems: Adapting to Reduce Impacts 
9.2.11.1. Introduction
It is recognized that vulnerability and exposure can never be reduced to
zero but risk can be reduced by effective systems for early warning ofextreme events that may occur in the near- through to longer-termfuture (Broad and Agrawala, 2000; Da Silva et al., 2004; Haile, 2005; Pattet al., 2005; Hansen et al., 2011). This sense of ‘seeing the future’ by
understanding current and projected risks is essential to effectively
prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme events and disasters.
It is important to recognize that a changing climate poses additionaluncertainty and therefore early warning systems can contribute to climate-smart disaster risk management. Effective disaster risk management ina changing climate is facilitated by strong coordination within and
between sectors to realize adaptation potentials through assessingvulnerabilities and taking anticipatory actions (Choularton, 2007;Braman et al., 2010).
9.2.11.2. Background
The Hyogo Framework for Action (UNISDR, 2010; Chapter 7) stresses thatearly warning systems should be “people centered” and that warningsneed to be “timely and understandable to those at risk” and need to“take into account the demographic, gender, cultural, and livelihoodcharacteristics of the target audiences.” “Guidance on how to actupon warnings” should be included. An early warning system is thusconsiderably more than just a forecast of an impending hazard.
In 2006, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster
Reduction completed a global survey of early warning systems. Theexecutive summary opened with the statement that “If an effectivetsunami early warning system had been in place in the Indian Oceanregion on 26 December 2004, thousands of lives would have beensaved. ... Effective early warning systems not only save lives but alsohelp protect livelihoods and national development gains” (Basher,2006; UN, 2006). Improved early warning systems have contributed toreductions in deaths, injuries, and livelihood losses over the last 30 years(IFRC, 2009). Early warning systems are important at local (Chapter 5),national (Chapter 6), and international scales (Chapter 7). Toward theachievement of sustainable development, early warning systems provideimportant information for decisionmaking and in avoiding tippingpoints (Chapter 8).
9.2.11.3. Description of Strategy of Early Warning Systems
Early warning systems are to alert and inform citizens and governmentsof changes on time scales of minutes to hours for immediate threatsrequiring urgent evasive action; weeks for more advanced preparedness;and seasons and decades for climate variations and changes (Brunet etal., 2010). To date most early warning systems have been based onweather predictions, which provide short-term warnings often withsufficient lead time and accuracy to take evasive action. However, therange of actions that can be taken is limited. Weather predictions oftenprovide less than 24 hours notice of an impending extreme weatherevent and options in resource-poor areas may not extend beyond theemergency evacuations of people (Chapter 5). Thus although lives maybe saved, livelihoods can be destroyed, especially those of the poorestcommunities.
While most of the successfully implemented early warning systems to
date have focused on shorter time scales, for example, for tornadoes(Doswell et al., 1993), benefits of improved predictions on sub-seasonalto seasonal scales are being addressed (Nicholls, 2001; Brunet et al.,2010; Webster et al., 2010). While hazardous atmospheric events canChapter 9 Case Studies518develop in a matter of minutes (in the case of tornadoes), it can be
across seasons and decades that occurrence of extremes can changeclimatically (McBean, 2000). Since planning for hazardous eventsinvolves decisions across a full range of time scales, ‘An Earth-systemPrediction Initiative for the 21st Century’ covering all scales has beenproposed (Shapiro et al., 2007, 2010). 
With the rapid growth in the number of humanitarian disasters, the
disaster risk management community has become attentive to changesin extreme events possibly attributed to climate change includingfloods, droughts, heat waves, and storms that cause the most frequentand economically damaging disasters (Gall et al., 2009; Munich Re,2010; Vos et al., 2010). Early warning systems provide an adaptationoption to minimize damaging impacts resulting from projected severeevents. Such systems also provide a mechanism to increase publicknowledge and awareness of natural risks and may foster improvedpolicy- and decisionmaking at various levels. 
Important developments in recent years in the area of sub-seasonal and
seasonal-to-interannual prediction have led to significant improvements
in predictions of weather and climate extremes (Nicholls, 2001; Simmonsand Hollingsworth, 2002; Kharin and Zwiers, 2003; Medina-Cetina andNadim, 2008). Some of these improvements, such as the use of soilmoisture initialization for weather and (sub-) seasonal prediction (Kosteret al., 2010), have potential for applications in transitional zones betweenwet and dry climates, and in particular in mid-latitudes (Koster et al.,2004). Such applications may potentially be relevant for projections oftemperature extremes and droughts (Lawrimore et al., 2007; Schubertet al., 2008; Koster et al.,  2010). Decadal and longer time scale predic tions
are improving and could form the basis for early warning systems in thefuture (Meehl et al., 2007, 2009; Palmer et al., 2008; Shukla et al., 2009,2010).
Developing resiliency to weather and climate involves developing
resiliency to its variability on a continuum of time scales, and in an idealworld, early warnings would be available across this continuum (Chapters1 and 2; McBean, 2000; Hellmuth et al., 2011). However, investments indeveloping such resiliency are usually primarily informed by information
only over the expected lifetime of the investment, especially among
poorer communities. For the decision of which crops to grow next sea son,
some consideration may be given to longer-term strategies but the
more pressing concern is likely to be the expected climate over the next
season. Indeed, there is little point in preparing to survive the impacts ofpossible disasters a century in the future if one is not equipped to survivemore immediate threats. Thus, within the disaster risk management
community, preparedness for climate change must involve preparednessfor climate variability (Chapters 3 and 4).
Improving prediction methods remains an active area of research and it
is hoped significant further progress will be reached in coming years
(Brunet et al., 2010; Shapiro et al., 2010). However for such predictions
to be of use to end users, improved communication will be required to
develop indices appropriate for specific regional impacts. A betterawareness of such issues in the climate modeling community through
greater feedback from the disaster risk management community (andother user communities) may lead to the development of additionalapplications for weather and climate hazard predictions. Predictionsystems, if carefully targeted and sufficiently accurate, can be usefultools for reducing the risks related to climate and weather extremes(Patt et al., 2005; Goddard et al., 2010). 
Despite an inevitable focus on shorter-term survival and hence interest
in shorter-term hazard warnings, the longer time scales cannot beignored if reliable predictions are to be made. Changing greenhouse gasconcentrations are important even for seasonal forecasting, becauseincluding realistic greenhouse gas concentrations can significantlyimprove forecast skill (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2006; Liniger et al., 2007).Similarly, adaptation tools traditionally based on long-term records
(e.g., stream flow measurements over 50 to 100 years) coupled with the
assumption that the climate is not changing may lead to incorrectconclusions about the best adaptation strategy to follow (Milly et al.,2008). Thus reliable prediction and successful adaptation both need aperspective that includes consideration of short to long time scales(days to decades).
While there are potential benefits of early warning systems (NRC, 2003;
Shapiro et al., 2007) that span a continuum of time scales, for much ofthe disaster risk management community the idea of preparednessbased on predictions is a new concept. Most communities have largelyoperated in a reactive mode, either to disasters that have already occurredor in emergency preparedness for an imminent disaster predicted withhigh confidence (Chapter 5). The possibility of using weather and climatepredictions longer than a few days to provide advanced warning ofextreme conditions has only been a recent development (Brunet et al.,2010; Shapiro et al., 2010). Despite over a decade of operational seasonalpredictions in many parts of the globe, examples of the use of suchinformation by the disaster risk management community are scarce, dueto the uncertainty of predictions and comprehension of their implications(Patt et al., 2005; Meinke et al., 2006; Hansen et al., 2011). Mostseasonal rainfall predictions, for example, are presented as probabilitiesthat total rainfall over the coming few (typically three) months will beamongst the highest or lowest third of rainfall totals as measured overa historical period and these are averaged over large areas (typicallytens of thousands of square kilometers). Not only are the probabilitieslacking in precision but the target variable – seasonal rainfall total –does not necessarily map well onto flood occurrence. Although higher-than-normal seasonal rainfall will often be associated with a higher riskof floods, it is possible for the seasonal rainfall total to be unusuallyhigh yet no flooding occurs. Alternatively, the total may be unusuallylow, yet flooding might occur because of the occurrence of an isolatedheavy rainfall event (Chapter 3). Thus even when seasonal predictionsare understood properly, it may not be obvious how to utilize them.These problems emphasize the need for the development of tools totranslate such information into quantities directly relevant to end users.Better communication between modeling centers and end users isneeded (Chapters 5 and 6). Where targeted applications have been
Chapter 9 Case Studies519developed, some success has been reported (e.g., for malaria prediction)
(Thomson et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007). Nonetheless there may beadditional obstacles such as policy constraints that restrict the range ofpossible actions.
9.2.11.4. Interventions
There are many examples of interventions of early warning systemsoutlined in the other case studies of this chapter and also in Chapters 5, 6,and 7. As a part of their strategy of reducing risk, the Victorian Governmentin Australia has established the heat wave early warning system for
metropolitan Melbourne and is undertaking similar work for regional
Victoria (see Case Study 9.2.2). A Storm Warning Center and associatedcoastal volunteer network has been established in Bangladesh and hasbeen proven effective (Case Study 9.2.5). The absence of a storm warningsystem in Myanmar contributed to the tragedy of that event (Case Study9.2.5). The benefits of early warning systems are also discussed withrespect to floods (Case Study 9.2.6), heat waves (Case Study 9.2.1),epidemic disease (Case Study 9.2.7), and drought (Case Study 9.2.3). 
9.2.11.5. Outcomes
There have been examples of major benefits of early warning systems(Einstein and Sousa, 2007). Assessments of community capacity torespond to cyclone warnings have been performed for India (Sharma etal., 2009), Florida (Smith and McCarty, 2009), New Orleans (Burnside etal., 2007), New South Wales, Australia (Cretikos et al., 2008), and China(Wang et al., 2008). Predictions of landfall for tropical cyclones areimportant (Davis et al., 2008). In Bangladesh (Case Study 9.2.5; Paul,2009), the implementation of an early warning system enabled peopleto evacuate a hazardous area promptly (Paul and Dutt, 2010; Stein etal., 2010). If forecasts are frequently incorrect, the response of people isaffected (Chapter 5; Dow and Cutter, 1998). Public health impacts ofhazards also depend on the preparedness of the local community (Vogtand Sapir, 2009) and this can be improved by early warnings. However,accurate predictions alone are insufficient for a successful early warning
system, as is demonstrated by the case in the United Kingdom – a country
that regularly experiences flooding (Parker et al., 2009). Severe damage
and health problems followed flooding in 2007 due to insufficiently clearwarning communication, issued too late and inadequately coordinated,
so that people, local government, and support services were unprepared(UNISDR, 2009c). Heat-health warnings (Case Study 9.2.1) have provedmore effective (Fouillet et al., 2008; Hajat et al., 2010; Michelozzi et al.,
2010; Rubio et al., 2010) although improvements are still needed(Kalkstein and Sheridan, 2007).
Notwithstanding the difficulties outlined for use of seasonal predictions in
disaster risk management, the successful use of such predictions has beenpossible (IRI, 2011). Since all preparative actions have some direct cost
and it is impractical to be always prepared for all eventualities, seasonalpredictions can help to choose priorities from a list of actions. 9.2.11.6. Lessons Identified
Early warning systems for extreme weather- or climate-related events,such as heat waves, floods, and storms have been implemented toprovide warnings on time scales of hours to days. The skill of warningsbeyond a few days ahead is improving as seasonal predictions are now
demonstrating benefits for drought, floods, and other phenomena, and
decadal forecasts of increased numbers of intense precipitation eventsand heat waves are now being factored into planning decisions (NRC,2003; Lazo et al., 2009; Goddard et al., 2010). It is expected that earlywarning systems will enable the implementation of DRR and CCA. Earlywarning systems rely on the ability of people to factor information on thefuture into plans and strategies and need to be coupled with educationprograms, legislative initiatives, and scientific demonstrations of theskill and cost value benefits of these systems.
9.2.12. Effective Legislation for Multilevel Governance
of Disaster Risk Reduction and Adaptation
9.2.12.1. Introduction
This case study, through focus on South Africa’s disaster risk management
law and comparable legal arrangements in other states, such as thePhilippines and Colombia, explores critical provisions for effectivelegislation. South Africa’s legislation has served as a model for others(Pelling and Holloway, 2006; Van Niekerk, 2011) because it focuses onprevention, decentralizes DRR governance, mandates the integration ofDRR into development planning, and requires stakeholder inclusiveness.Implementation has proven challenging, however, particularly at thelocal level (NDMC, 2007, 2010; Visser and Van Niekerk, 2009; Botha etal., 2011; Van Niekerk, 2011) as is the case for most states (GNDR, 2009;UNISDR, 2011b). Through analysis of South Africa’s legislation and thedifficulties that it faces in implementation, this study provides relevantinformation to other governments as they assess whether their ownnational legislation to reduce and manage disaster risk is adequate foradapting to climate change. 
9.2.12.2. Background
A legal framework establishes legal authority for programs andorganizations that relate to hazards, risk, and risk management. Theselaws may dictate – or encourage – policies, practices, processes, theassignment of authorities and responsibilities to individuals and/orinstitutions, and the creation of institutions or mechanisms forcoordination or collaborative action among institutions (Mattingly, 2002).Law can be used to provide penalties and incentives by enforcingstandards, to empower existing agencies or establish new bodies withnew responsibilities, and to assign budget lines (Pelling and Holloway,2006). In short, legislation enables and promotes sustainable engage ment,
helps to avoid disjointed action at various levels, and provides recoursefor society when things go wrong.Chapter 9 Case Studies520Most states have some form of disaster risk management legislation or
are in the process of enacting it (UNDP 2005; UNISDR 2005b). In 2011,48 countries reported substantial achievements in developing nationalpolicy and legislation; importantly, almost half are low or lower-middleincome countries (UNISDR, 2011b). An increasing number of countrieshave been adopting or updating existing legislation modeled on HyogoFramework for Action principles. Countries with new or updated lawsinclude India and Sri Lanka in 2005; El Salvador, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent,and the Grenadines in 2006; Anguilla (United Kingdom) and Gambia in2007; Indonesia in 2008; Egypt and the Philippines in 2009;  and Zambia
and Papua New Guinea in 2010 (UNISDR, 2011b). As yet some of the newlaws addressing disaster risk have not been harmonized with preexistinglegislative frameworks in relevant sectors, such as water, agriculture,and energy (UNISDR, 2011b). Although these national legislations fordisaster management do not necessarily include a disaster risk reductionorientation (Pelling and Holloway 2006), the evidence suggests a globalparadigm shift from the former responsive approach to disastermanagement toward more long-term, sustainable preventive action(Britton, 2006; Benson, 2009). India, Pakistan, Indonesia, South Africa,and several Central American states have enacted such paradigm-changing amendments to disaster management legislation and, inEcuador, the “notion of risk-focused disaster management was rooteddirectly into its new constitution adopted in 2008” (IFRC, 2011). 
In the case of South Africa, the country was impacted by floods and
droughts, and there was a high motivation for change in the post-Apartheid era (Pelling and Holloway, 2006; NDMC, 2007), which startingin 1994 led to legislative reform for disaster risk reduction. A “GreenPaper” first solicited public input and debate, and a second “WhitePaper” translated responses into policy options for further technical andadministrative deliberations. These documents are noteworthy for theirconsultative approach and their emphasis on disaster risk reductionrather than traditional response (Pelling and Holloway, 2006; NDMC,2007). Thereafter the Government passed three disaster managementbills that culminated in the promulgation of the Disaster ManagementAct No. 57 of 2002 and of the National Disaster Management Frameworkin 2005 (Pelling and Holloway, 2006; NDMC, 2007). 
9.2.12.3. Description of Strategy
South Africa’s 2002 Disaster Management Act and its National DisasterManagement Policy Framework of 2005 (Republic of South Africa, 2002,
2005) are noteworthy because they were among the first to focus on
prevention, decentralize DRR governance, mandate the integration of
DRR into development planning, and require stakeholder inclusiveness.
The Act and Framework define the hierarchical institutional structure
that governs disaster risk reduction at national, provincial, and municipallevels. They effectively decentralize DRR by mandating each level of
government to create: 
•A disaster risk management framework – a policy focused on the
prevention and mitigation of risk•A disaster risk management center – inter alia , to promote an
integrated and coordinated system of management, to integrateDRR into development plans, to maintain disaster risk managementinformation, to monitor implementation, and to build capacity
•A disaster risk management advisory forum – for government andcivil society stakeholders in DRR to coordinate their actions
•An interdepartmental disaster risk management committee – forgovernment departments to coordinate or integrate activities forDRR, to compile disaster risk management plans, and to provideinterdepartmental accountability (Republic of South Africa, 2002,2005; Van Niekerk, 2006).
The Act further details each entity’s responsibilities. South Africa’s
legislation makes a legal connection between disaster risk reductionand development planning. Some other countries adopting thisapproach include Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Hungary, Ivory Coast,Mauritius, Romania, and Uganda (Pelling and Holloway, 2006).
The Act requires that municipalities include risk management plans in
their integrated development plans (Republic of South Africa, 2002; VanNiekerk, 2006). Municipal-level requirements are supported with amandate for provincial governments to ensure that their disaster riskmanagement plans “form an integral part of development planning” andfor the National Centre of Disaster Management to develop guidelinesfor the integration of plans and strategies into development plans(Republic of South Africa, 2002). 
Closely related to the ability to influence development planning is the
authority to lead coordinated government action for DRR acrossgovernment agencies. The interdepartmental committees mandated bythe Act for each level provide the opportunity to communicate plansand develop strategies across ministries and departments, avoidingunilateral action that may increase risk. The forums established by theAct similarly give voice to additional stakeholders to participate in DRRdecisionmaking. South Africa, Colombia, and the Philippines’ DRR laws,for example, include provisions for the involvement of NGOs, traditionalleaders, volunteers, community members, and the private sector indisaster risk reduction.
9.2.12.4. Outcomes
Implementation of South Africa’s benchmark legislative provisions hasproven challenging. Many district municipalities have not yet establishedthe disaster management centers required by the Act or these are notyet functioning adequately (Van Riet and Diedericks, 2010; Botha et al.,2011). The majority of local municipalities (which are subdivisions ofdistrict municipalities) have not yet established advisory forumsalthough it should be noted that the Act does not require their creationat this level (Botha et al., 2011). A greater percentage of metropolitandistricts have established advisory forums. Similarly, interdepartmentalcommittees, which facilitate cross-sectoral governmental collaboration
and the integration of DRR into development planning, have also not yetChapter 9 Case Studies521been established in a majority of municipalities. Although municipalities
reported good progress in integrating their disaster management plansinto integrated development plans (Botha et al., 2011), such plans asyet contain little evidence of integration (Van Niekerk, 2011). 
Provincial and municipal levels attribute the lack of progress in
implementing the Act and Framework to inadequate resources forstart-up costs for municipalities as well as for the continuous operationsof disaster risk reduction projects (Visser and Van Niekerk, 2009; NDMC,2010). There is also the continuing need for resources for responserecovery and rehabilitation activities. Reasons for the lack of fundinginclude a lack of clarity of the Act on funding sources and confusionregarding the processes to access various sources of funding (Visser andVan Niekerk, 2009). Although the mechanisms to obtain funding exist,not all municipalities and provinces are using them, hence the perceptionof inadequate funding persists (Van Niekerk, 2011). In some cases thereappears to be an absolute lack of funds, such as in district municipalities,which are more rural and less densely populated, and have a narrowertax base to fund DRR (Van Riet and Diedericks, 2010). This situation issimilar to that in other countries, such as Colombia, where more than80% of municipalities are able to assign only 20% of their own non-earmarked resources to risk reduction and disaster response. Becausethe law does not stipulate percentages and amounts, municipalitiesallocate minimal sums for disaster risk reduction (MIJ, 2009) givencompeting infrastructure and social spending needs (Cardona andYamín, 2007). 
South Africa and Colombia’s experiences are replayed around the world.
Governments informed in their 2011 Hyogo Framework progress reportsthat the lack of efficient and appropriate budget allocations remains oneof the major challenges for effective disaster risk reduction legislation(UNISDR, 2011a). Even in countries in which funding for disaster riskmanagement is mandated by law, actual resource allocation for disasterrisk reduction remains low and is concentrated in preparedness andresponse (UNDP , 2007). The Philippines has new legislation thatattempts to address these issues. The Philippines new Disaster RiskReduction and Management Act 10121 renames the Local CalamityFund as the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund and
stipulates that no less than 5% shall be set aside for risk management
and preparedness (Republic of the Philippines, 2010). Further, to carryout the provisions of the Act, the Commission allocated one billion
pesos or US$ 21.5 million (Republic of the Philippines, 2010). Unspent
money will remain in the fund to promote risk reduction and disaster
preparedness. The adequacy of this provision has yet to be tested as theAct is recent and implementation has yet to begin.
In South Africa, all relevant national departments have yet to undertake
required DRR activities or identified sectoral focal points; consequently,
the advisory committee at the national level is not yet functioning
optimally (Van Niekerk, 2011). Similarly, at provincial and municipal levels,departmental representatives are absent or too junior to make decisions
at meetings, reflecting lack of understanding about their department’srole in DRR and about DRR generally (Van Riet and Diedericks, 2010).Moreover, as mentioned above, between 55 and 73% of municipalities
have not established a committee, which Botha et al. (2011) point outhampers local government’s ability to implement integrated multi-sectoral DRM. 
The Philippines’ Climate Change Act, enacted in 2009, addresses the
challenge of inter-sectoral government collaboration by creating acommission to be chaired by the president and attached to that office, thusensuring highest-level political support for collaborative implementationof the law (Republic of the Philippines, 2009). The commission is com posed
of the secretaries of all relevant departments as well as the Secretary ofthe Department of National Defense, as Chair of the National DisasterCoordinating Council, and representatives from the disaster risk reduc tion
community. The main functions of the Commission are to “ensure themainstreaming of climate change, in synergy with disaster risk reduction,
into the national, sectoral, and local development plans and programs”and to create a panel of technical experts, “consisting of practitionersin disciplines that are related to climate change, including disaster riskreduction” (Republic of the Philippines, 2009).
Implementing the multi-sectoral DRM envisioned by South Africa’s
legislation may be hindered by the placement of the National DisasterManagement Centre within a line ministry (the Department ofCooperative Governance) (Van Niekerk, 2011). Sub-national levels havelikewise placed their centers within sectors with insufficient politicalauthority; consequently, local municipal and district levels rate currentinterdepartmental collaboration as low (Botha et al., 2011). This place ment
allows other departments to disregard DRM, as the National DisasterManagement Centre cannot enforce punitive measures (Van Niekerk,2011).
Similar to South Africa’s arrangements, the Philippines’ highest
policymaking and coordinating body for disaster risk management, theNational Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (formerlycalled the National Disaster Coordinating Council), sits within theDepartment of National Defense. As such, it is focused on disasterpreparedness and response and does not have sustainable developmentand poverty reduction responsibilities. The Philippines’ new DisasterRisk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 attempts to redress thisissue by including experts from all relevant fields as members of theCouncil and expressly defining its mandate on mainstreaming disasterrisk reduction into sustainable development and poverty reductionstrategies, policies, plans, and budgets at all levels (Republic of thePhilippines, 2010). 
Positioning DRR institutions within the highest levels of government has
proven effective because this position often determines the amount ofpolitical authority of the national disaster risk management body(UNDP , 2007; UNISDR, 2009a). National disaster risk managementoffices attached to prime ministers’ offices usually can take initiativesaffecting line ministries, while their colleagues operating at the sub-ministerial level often face administrative bottlenecks (UNDP , 2007).High-level support is particularly important to enable disaster risk
Chapter 9 Case Studies522reduction legislation to provide a framework for strategies to build risk
reduction into development and reconstruction (Pelling and Holloway,2006). 
9.2.12.5. Lessons Identified
The main lesson that emerges from this case study is that carefully craftedlegislation buttresses DRR activities, thus avoiding a gap between thelaw’s vision and its implementation. The experiences of South Africa andthe Philippines in implementing their DRR legislation (as described by
Visser and Van Niekerk, 2009; NDMC, 2010; Van Riet and Diedericks,
2010; Botha et al., 2011; Van Niekerk, 2011) and the literature on DRRlegislation (Mattingly, 2002; Britton, 2006; Pelling and Holloway, 2006;UNDP , 2007; Benson, 2009; UNISDR, 2009c) point to the followingelements of effective legislation and implementation:
•The law allocates adequate funding for implementation at all levelswith clarity about the generation of funds and procedures foraccessing resources at every administrative level.
•The institutional arrangements provide both access to power forfacilitating implementation and opportunities to ‘mainstream’disaster risk reduction and adaptation into development plans. 
•The law includes provisions that increase accountability and enablecoordination and implementation, that is, the clear identification ofroles and responsibilities and access to participate in decisionmaking.
An additional element is the need for periodic assessment and revision
to ensure that legislation for disaster risk reduction and adaptation isdynamic and relevant (Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). For instance, thePhilippines’ Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Act calls forthe development of a framework to guide disaster risk reduction andmanagement efforts to be reviewed “on a five-year interval, or as maybe deemed necessary, in order to ensure its relevance to the times”(Republic of the Philippines, 2010). The DRRM Act also calls for thedevelopment of assessments on hazards and risks brought about byclimate change (Republic of the Philippines, 2010). Likewise, thePhilippines Climate Change Act calls for the framework strategy that willguide climate change planning, research and development, extension,
and monitoring of activities to be reviewed every three years or as
necessary (Republic of the Philippines, 2009). Similarly, the United
Kingdom’s Climate Change Act establishes the preparation of a reportinforming parliament on risks of current and predicted impact of climate
change no later than five years after the previous report (UnitedKingdom, 2008). Thus an additional element for effective DRR-adapta tion
legislation may be that the law be based on up-to-date risk assessmentand mandates periodic reassessment as risks evolve and knowledge ofclimate change impacts improves. 
Developing and enacting legislation takes considerable time and political
capital. It took South Africa and the Philippines about a decade to enactcomprehensive disaster risk reduction frameworks. Linking the
development of disaster risk reduction legislation to the politically
prominent climate change discussion could substantially increase thesense of urgency and thus speed of parliamentary processes (Llosa and
Zodrow, 2011). 
Another method for hastening the legislative process would be to first
assess the adequacy of existing disaster risk reduction legislation andstrengthen these laws rather than starting a wholly new drafting andnegotiations process for adaptation that may create a parallel legal andoperational system (Llosa and Zodrow, 2011). As frequently reported(e.g., UNDP , 2007; UNISDR, 2009c), an overload of laws and regulationswithout a coherent and comprehensive framework, clear competencies,and budget allocations hinders the effective implementation of disasterrisk reduction legislation. 
9.2.13. Risk Transfer: The Role of Insurance and Other
Instruments in Disaster Risk Management andClimate Change Adaptation in Developing Countries
9.2.13.1. Introduction
The human and economic toll from disasters can be greatly amplified by
the long-term loss in incomes, health, education, and other forms ofcapital resulting from the inability of communities to restore infrastructure,housing, sanitary conditions, and livelihoods in a timely way (Mechler,2004; Mills, 2005). By providing timely financial assistance followingextreme event shocks, insurance and other risk-transfer instrumentscontribute to DRR by reducing the medium- and long-term consequencesof disasters. These instruments are widespread in developed countries,and are gradually becoming part of disaster management in developingcountries, where novel micro-insurance programs are helping to putcash into the hands of affected poor households so they can beginrebuilding livelihoods (Bhatt et al., 2010). These mechanisms can alsocontribute to reducing vulnerability and advancing development evenbefore disasters strike by providing the requisite security for farmers andfirms to undertake higher-return, yet more risky investments in the faceof pervasive risk. Governments also engage in risk transfer. Investorscan be encouraged to invest in a country if there is evidence that thegovernment has reduced its risks (Gurenko, 2004).
9.2.13.2. Background
This case study focuses on instruments for risk transfer in order to managecatastrophe risk in developing countries (see also Sections 5.5.2, 6.5.3,and 7.4.4). Table 9-3 provides an overview of financial instruments andarrangements, including risk transfer, as they are employed by households,farmers, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and governments,as well as international organizations and donors. Typically, losses arereimbursed on an ad hoc basis after disasters strike through appeals tosolidarity, for example, from neighbors, governments, and internationaldonors. Households and other agents also rely on savings and credit,and many governments set aside national or sub-national level reservefunds. Alternatively, agents can engage in risk transfer (the shaded cellsChapter 9 Case Studies523in Table 9-3), which is defined by UNISDR as “the process of formally or
informally shifting the financial consequences of particular risks fromone party to another whereby a household, community, enterprise orstate authority will obtain resources from the other party after a disasteroccurs, in exchange for ongoing or compensatory social or financialbenefits provided to that other party” (UNISDR, 2009b). Risk sharingcan be considered synonymous with risk transfer, although the latter isoften used to connote more informal forms of shifting risk withoutexplicit compensation or payment, for example, mutual non-marketarrangements among family or community. Insurance is the best knownform of market risk transfer; yet, risks can be transferred with manyformal and informal instruments as described in the following section. 
Traditional channels for financing disaster relief and recovery, although
in many cases less costly than risk transfer, have in the past proved tobe inadequate for managing large-scale weather-related events in highlyvulnerable countries (Cohen and Sebstad, 2003; Cardenas et al., 2007;Barnett et al., 2008). In poor countries, households and businesses usuallydo not have the resources to purchase commercial insurance to covertheir risks with the additional difficulty that in many developing countriesthe commercial insurance providers do not exist. If there is no supportfrom family or government, disasters can lead to a worsening of povertyin the absence of insurance. The victims then must either obtain high-interest loans (or default on existing loans), sell their important and valuedassets and livestock, or engage in low-risk, low-yield farming to lessen
their exposure to extreme events (Varangis et al., 2002). In recognition ofthese issues and to reduce the overall costs of disasters, investments in
disaster risk reduction and proactive risk transfer are strongly encouragedby governments, the insurance sector, and the donor community (Kreimer
and Arnold, 2000; Guren ko, 2004; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005). 
9.2.13.3. Description of Strategy – Catastrophe Risk Transfer
Mechanisms and Instruments 
As shown by the shaded cells in Table 9-3, risk transfer includes a range
of pre-disaster mechanisms and instruments (Cummins and Mahul,
2009), the most important of which are briefly described below:
•Informal mutual arrangements involve pre-agreed non-market
exchanges of post-disaster support (informal risk sharing). •Insurance is a “well-known form of risk transfer, where coverage of
a risk is obtained from an insurer in exchange for ongoing premiumspaid to the insurer” (UNISDR, 2009b). A contractual transactionbased on a premium is used to guarantee financial protectionagainst potentially large loss; contracts typically cover losses toproperty, productive assets, commercial facilities, crops andlivestock, public infrastructure (sovereign insurance), and businessinterruption. 
•Micro-insurance , based on the same principles as insurance, is
aimed, most often, at lower-income individuals who cannot affordtraditional insurance and hence the premiums are lower but alsothe coverage may be restricted. In some cases, the individuals areunable to access more traditional insurance (Mechler et al., 2006).Often it is provided in innovative partnerships involvingcommunities, NGOs, self-help groups, rural development banks,insurers, government authorities, and donors.
•Alternative risk transfer denotes a range of arrangements that
hedge risk (Mechler et al., 2006). These include catastrophe bonds,which are instruments where the investor receives an above-market return when a pre-specified catastrophe does not occurwithin a specified time interval. However, the investor sacrificesinterest or part of the principal following the event. 
•Weather derivatives typically take the form of a parametric
(indexed-based) transaction, where payment is made if a chosenweather index, such as 5-day rainfall amounts, exceeds somepredetermined threshold. 
•Contingent credit (also called deferred drawdown option) is a
prearranged loan contingent on a specified event; it can be providedby the insurance industry to other insurers, or by internationalfinancial institutions to governments.
•Risk pools aggregate risks regionally (or nationally) allowing
individual risk holders to spread their risk geographically.

are briefly discussed below.
9.2.13.4.1. Covering local risks: index-based micro-insurance
for crop risks in India
Micro-insurance to cover, for example, life and health is widespread in
developing countries, but applications for catastrophic risks to cropsand property are in the beginning phases (see Morelli et al., 2010 for areview, and Loster and Reinhard, 2010 for a focus on micro-insurance
and climate change). Typically a micro-insurance company, often
operating on a not-for-profit basis, evolves from an organization thathas developed insurance products for a community. Most are based onthe expectation that the pool of participants will provide payments thatcover the costs incurred, including expected damage claims (which aregenerally low because of infrequent and small claims), administrativecosts (which are reduced through group contracts or linking contractsto loans), taxes, and regulatory fees. Many depend on the support ofgovernment subsidies and international development organizations andparticipation of NGOs (Mechler et al., 2006).
An innovative insurance program set up in India in 2003 covers non-
irrigated crops in the state of Andhra Pradesh against the risk ofinsufficient rainfall during key times during the cropping season. Theindex-based policies are offered by a commercial insurer and marketedto growers through microfinance banks. In contrast to conventionalinsurance, which is written against actual losses, this index-based(parametric) insurance is written against a physical or economic trigger,in this case rainfall measured by a local rain gauge. The scheme owes itsexistence to technical assistance provided by the World Bank (Hess andSyroka, 2005). Schemes replicating this approach are currently targeting700,000 exposed farmers in India (Cummins and Mahul, 2009).
One advantage of index-based insurance is the substantial decrease in
transaction costs due to eliminating the need for expensive post-eventclaims handling, which has impeded the development of insurancemechanisms in developing countries (Varangis et al., 2002). A disadvantageis basis risk, which is the lack of correlation of the trigger with the loss
incurred. If the rainfall measured at the weather station is sufficient, but
for isolated farmers insufficient, they will not receive compensation for
crop losses. Similar schemes are implemented or underway, for instance,
in Malawi, Ukraine, Peru, Thailand, and Ethiopia (Hellmuth et al., 2009). Ablueprint for insuring farmers in developing countries who face threats to
their livelihoods from adverse weather has been developed (World Bank,2005d). Overcoming major institutional and other barriers must be donein order for these programs to achieve this target (Hellmuth et al., 2009).
Weather insurance and especially index-based contracts contribute, in at
least two ways, to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.Since farmers will receive payment based on rainfall and thus have an
incentive to plant weather-resistant crops, indexed contracts eliminatemoral hazard, which is defined as the disincentive for risk preventionprovided by the false perception of security when purchasing insurance
coverage. Second, an insurance contract renders high-risk farmers morecreditworthy, which enables them to access loans for agricultural inputs.This was illustrated in the pilot program in Malawi, where farmerspurchased index-based drought insurance linked to loans to cover costsof hybrid seed, with the result that their productivity was doubled(Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2009). Increased productivity decreasesvulnerability to weather extremes, thus contributing to climate changeadaptation (to the extent that risks of weather extremes are increasedby climate change). In another innovative micro-insurance project inEthiopia, farmers can pay their premiums by providing labor on risk-reducing projects (Suarez and Linnerooth-Bayer, 2010).
9.2.13.4.2. Covering national risks:
the Ethiopian weather derivative
The World Food Programme (WFP), to supplement and partly replace its
traditional food-aid approach to famine, has recently supported theEthiopian government-sponsored Productive Safety Net Programme(PSNP). The WFP is now insuring it against extreme drought (World Bank,2006b). When there is a food emergency, the PSNP is able to provideimmediate cash payments that may be sufficient to save lives even inthe case of very severe droughts (Hess et al., 2006). However, thesepayments may not be sufficient to restore livelihoods (World Bank, 2006b).To provide extra capital in the case of extreme drought, an index-basedcontract, sometimes referred to as a weather derivative, was designedby the WFP . The amount of capital is based on contractually specifiedcatastrophic shortfalls in precipitation based on the Ethiopia DroughtIndex (EDI). The EDI depends on rainfall amounts that were measured at26 weather stations that represent the various agricultural areas ofEthiopia. In 2006, the WFP successfully obtained an insurance contractbased on the EDI through an international reinsurer (Hess et al., 2006).A drawback of this arrangement, in contrast to the micro-insuranceprograms in India and Malawi, is that it perpetuates dependence onpost-drought government assistance with accompanying moral hazard. 
9.2.13.4.3. Intergovernmental risk sharing: the Caribbean
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF)
The world’s first regional catastrophe insurance pool was launched in
2007 in the Caribbean region; this is the Caribbean Catastrophe RiskInsurance Facility (discussed in Section 7.4.4). Sixteen participatinggovernments secured insurance protection against costs associatedwith catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes (Ghesquiere etal., 2006; World Bank, 2007). Several of the participating countriesrepresent the countries experiencing the greatest economic losses fromdisasters in the last few decades, when measured as a share of GDP(CCRIF , 2010).
The aim of the Caribbean facility is to provide immediate liquidity to
cover part of the costs that participating governments expect to incurChapter 9 Case Studies525while they provide relief and assistance for recovery and rehabilitation.
Because it does not cover all costs, CCRIF provides an incentive forgovernments to invest in risk reduction and other risk transfer tools. Thecost of participation is based on estimates of the respective countries’ risk(measured as probability and cost). The advantage of pooling is that dueto diversifying risk it greatly reduces the costs of reinsurance comparedto the price each government would have paid individually. Fundingfor the program, although mainly the responsibility of participatingcountries, has been supported by a donor conference hosted by theWorld Bank.
Insofar as weather extremes are increased by climate change, the CCRIF
contributes directly to disaster risk reduction and climate changeadaptation. By providing post-event capital it enables governments torestore critical infrastructure so important for reducing the long-termhuman and economic impacts from hurricanes. Experience with CCRIFalso shows the importance of designing programs that reflect the needsof the participating countries. Finally, it demonstrates how internationalassistance can support disaster management in tandem with nationalresponsibility.
9.2.13.4.4. Outcomes – the role of risk transfer for advancing
disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation
As these examples illustrate, risk-transfer instruments and especially
insurance can promote disaster risk reduction and climate changeadaptation by enabling recovery and productive activities. By providingmeans to finance relief, recovery of livelihoods, and reconstruction,insurance reduces long-term indirect losses – even human losses – thatdo not show up in the disaster statistics. Risk transfer arrangementsthus directly lead to the reduction of post-event losses from extremeweather events, what is commonly viewed as adaptation. Moreover,insured households and businesses can plan with more certainty, andbecause of the safety net provided by insurance, they can take on cost-effective, yet risky, investments. This ultimately reduces vulnerabilityto weather extremes and by so doing contributes to climate changeadaptation.
Experience in developed countries has demonstrated additional ways in
which insurance and other risk-transfer instruments have promoted
DRR and CCA as listed below:
• Because risk-transfer instruments require detailed analysis of risk,
they can both raise awareness and provide valuable information
for its response and reduction; for example, in some developedcountries insurers with other partners have made flood and other
hazard maps publicly available (Botzen et al., 2009; Warner et al.,2009). Potential challenges include the technical difficulties relatedto risk assessment, dissemination of appropriate information, and
overcoming education and language barriers in some areas.
• By pricing risk, insurance can provide incentives for investments
and behavior that reduce vulnerability and exposure, especially if
premium discounts are awarded. Differential premium pricing hasbeen effective in discouraging construction in high-risk areas; for
example, UK insurers price flood policies according to risk zones,but insurers are reluctant to award premium discounts for othertypes of mitigation measures, such as reinforcing windows anddoors to protect against hurricanes (Kunreuther and Roth, 1998;Kunreuther and Michel-Kerjan, 2009). The incentive effect ofactuarial risk pricing should be weighed against the benefits ofincreasing insurance penetration to those unable to afford risk-based premiums. The positive incentives provided by insuranceshould also not overshadow the potential for negative incentivesor moral hazard. 
• Insurers and other providers can make risk reduction a contractual
stipulation, for example, by requiring fire safety measures as acondition for insuring a home or business (Surminski, 2010). The USNational Flood Insurance Program requires communities to reducerisks as a condition for offering subsidized policies to their residents
(Kunreuther and Roth, 1998; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2007). It wasnoted above that the WFP might require risk-reducing activities asa condition for its support for weather derivatives. 
• Providers can partner with government and communities to
establish appropriate regulatory frameworks and promote, forinstance, land use planning, building codes, emergency response,and other types of risk-reducing policies. Ungern-Sternberg (2003)has shown that Swiss cantons having public monopolies that providedisaster insurance outperform cantons with private systems inreducing risks and premiums, mainly because the public monopolieshave better access to land use planning institutions, fire depart ments,
and other public authorities engaged in risk reduction. In manycountries, insurers have co-financed research institutes and disastermanagement centers, and in other cases, have partnered withgovernment to achieve changes in the planning system andinvestment in public protection measures (Surminski, 2010).
9.2.13.5. Lessons Identified
Governments, households, and businesses can experience liquidity gapslimiting their ability to recover from disasters ( high confidence ). There is
robust evidence to suggest that risk-transfer instruments can help
reduce this gap, thus enabling recovery.
There are a range of risk-transfer instruments, where insurance is the
most common. With support from the international community, risktransfer is becoming a reality in developing countries at the local,national, and international scales, but the future is still uncertain. Index-based contracts greatly reduce transaction costs and moral hazard(medium confidence ); while more costly than many traditional financing
measures, insurance has benefits both before disasters (by enablingproductive investment) and after disasters (by enabling reconstructionand recovery) ( medium confidence ). Insurance and other forms of risk
transfer can be linked to disaster risk reduction and climate changeadaptation by enabling recovery, reducing vulnerability, and providingknowledge and incentives for reducing risk ( medium confidence ).Chapter 9 Case Studies5269.2.14. Education, Training, and Public Awareness Initiatives
for Disaster Risk Reduction and Adaptation
9.2.14.1. Introduction
Disasters can be substantially reduced if people are well informed and
motivated to prevent risk and to build their own resilience (UNISDR,2005b). Disaster risk reduction education is broad in scope: it encompassesprimary and secondary schooling, training courses, academic programs,
and professional trades and skills training (UNISDR, 2004), community-
based assessment, public discourse involving the media, awarenesscampaigns, exhibits, memorials, and special events (Wisner, 2006). Giventhe breadth of the topic, this case study illustrates just a few practicesin primary school education, training programs, and awareness-raisingcampaigns in various countries. 
9.2.14.2. Background
The Hyogo Framework calls on states to “use knowledge, innovation,and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels”(UNISDR, 2005b). States report minor progress in implementation,however (UNISDR, 2009c). Challenges noted include the lack of capacityamong educators and trainers, difficulties in addressing needs in poorurban and rural areas, the lack of validation of methodologies and tools,and little exchange of experiences. On the positive side, the 2006-2007international campaign “Disaster Risk Reduction Begins at School”(UNISDR, 2006) raised awareness of the importance of education with55 governments undertaking awareness-raising activities and 22governments reporting success in making schools safer (e.g., 175 schoolsdeveloped disaster plans in Gujarat, India) by developing educationaland training materials, introducing school drills, and implementing DRRteacher trainings (UNISDR, 2008b). Furthermore, the implementationscheme of the United Nations Decade of Education for SustainableDevelopment 2005-2014 seeks to improve the knowledge base ondisaster reduction as one of the keys to sustainable development. 
A related emerging trend is to engage children in disaster risk reduction
and adaptation, as children are increasingly understood as effective agents
of change (Mitchell et al., 2009). Children’s inclusion also increases the
likelihood that they will maintain their own DRR and adaptation learning(Back et al., 2009). A report from five NGOs (Twigg and Bottomley, 2011)states that their DRR work with children and young people involves riskidentification and action planning for preparedness; training of school
teachers and students; DRR curriculum development; youth-led prevention
and risk reduction actions, such as mangrove and tree conservation;awareness raising (e.g., through peer-to-peer community exchanges
and children’s theater); and “lobbying and networking in promoting
and supporting children’s voice and action.”
Effective DRR education initiatives seek to elicit behavioral change not
only by imparting knowledge of natural hazards but also by engaging
people in identifying and reducing risk in their surroundings. In formaleducation, disaster risk education should not be confined within the
school but promoted to family and community (Shaw et al., 2004).Lectures can create knowledge, particularly if presented with visual aidsand followed up with conversation with other students. Yet it is family,community, and self learning, coupled with school education, thattransform knowledge into behavioral change (Shaw et al., 2004). 
9.2.14.3. Description of Strategies
9.2.14.3.1. School curriculum
States are increasingly incorporating DRR in the curriculum (UNISDR,
2009c) and have set targets for so doing in all school curricula by 2015(UNISDR, 2009c). Initiatives to integrate the teaching of climate changeand DRR are also emerging, such as the described Philippines program.Importantly, the new Philippines disaster risk reduction and climatechange laws mandate the inclusion of DRR and climate change,respectively, in school curricula; the following example predates theselaws, however. 
The Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre and UN Development
Programme, with the National Disaster Coordinating Council and supportfrom the European Commission Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection,assisted the Ministry of Education in the Philippines, Cambodia, and LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic to integrate disaster risk reduction intothe secondary school curriculum. Each country team developed its owndraft module, adapting it to local needs.
The Philippines added climate change and volcanic hazards into its
disaster risk reduction curriculum. The relevant lessons addressed ‘whatis climate change,’ they then asked ‘what is its impact,’ and finally ‘howcan you reduce climate change impact?’ Other lessons focused on theclimate system, typhoons, heat waves, and landslides, among otherrelated topics (Luna et al., 2008). The Philippines’ final disaster riskreduction module was integrated into 12 lessons in science and 16
lessons in social studies for the first year of secondary school (Grade 7)
(Luna et al., 2008). Each lesson includes group activities, questions to be
asked of the students, the topics that the teacher should cover in the
lecture, and a learning activity in which students apply knowledge
gained and methodology for evaluation of learning by the students
(Luna et al., 2008). The project reports that it reached 1,020 students,
including 548 girls, who learned about disaster risk reduction and cli mate
change. Twenty-three teachers participated in the four-day orientation
session. An additional 75 teach ers and personnel were trained to train
others and replicate the experience across the country (Luna et al., 2008). 
9.14.2.3.2. Training for disaster risk reduction and adaptation
In order to effectively include disaster risk reduction and adaptation in
the curriculum, teachers require (initial and in-service) training onthe substantive matter as well as the pedagogical tools (hands-on,Chapter 9 Case Studies527experiential learning) to elicit change (Shiwaku et al., 2006; Wisner,
2006). Education program proponents might have to overcome teachers’resistance to incorporate yet another topic into overburdened curricula.To enlist teachers’ cooperation, developing a partnership with theministry of education and school principals can be helpful (UNISDR,2007b; World Bank et al., 2009). The following program in Indonesiaand the evaluation results from Nepal demonstrate the importance ofengaging teachers for effective education. The subsequent example fromNepal, Pakistan, and India focuses on training builders through extensivehands-on components in which new techniques are demonstrated andparticipants practice these techniques under expert guidance (WorldBank et al., 2009).
The Disaster Awareness in Primary Schools project, which provides
teacher training, was launched in Indonesia in 2005 with German sup port
and is ongoing. By 2007, through this project, 2,200 school teachers hadreceived DRR training. Project implementers found that existing teachingmethods were not conducive to active learning. Students listened toteacher presentations, recited facts committed to memory, and were notencouraged to understand concepts and processes. The training tookteachers’ capabilities into account by emphasizing the importance ofclarity and perseverance in delivering lessons so as to avoid passing onfaulty life-threatening information (e.g., regarding evacuation routes).Scientific language was avoided and visual aids and activities encouraged.Teachers were asked to take careful notes and to participate in practicalactivities such as first-aid courses, thus modeling proactive learning.Continuity with the teachers’ traditional teaching methods wasmaintained by writing training modules in narrative form and followingthe established lesson plan model. Moreover, to avoid further burdeningteachers’ heavy lesson requirements and schedules, the modules weredesigned to be integrated into many subjects, such as language andphysical education, and to require minimum preparation (UNISDR, 2007b). 
In Nepal, Kyoto University researchers evaluated the knowledge and
perceptions of 130 teachers in 40 schools, most of whom were impartingdisaster education (Shiwaku et al., 2006). Through responses to a survey,the researchers found that the content of the disaster risk educationbeing imparted depended on the awareness of individual teachers.Teachers focused lessons on the effects of disasters with which they
could relate from personal experience. The researchers concluded that
teacher training is the most important step to improve disaster risk
education in Nepal. Most social studies teachers reported a need forteacher training but the survey analysis recommended that trainingprograms be designed to integrate DRR into any subject rather thantaught in special classes (Shiwaku et al., 2006).
The National Society for Earthquake Technology in Nepal conducted
large-scale training for masons, carpenters, bar benders, and constructionsupervisors in 2007 over a five-month period to impart risk-resilient
construction practices and materials. Participants from Kathmanduand five other municipalities formed working groups to train other
professionals. As the project was successful, a mason-exchange programwas designed with the Indian NGO Seeds. Nepali masons were sent toGujarat, India, to mentor local masons in the theory and practice of safer
construction. Also in India, the government of Uttar Pradesh trained twojunior engineers in the rural engineering service in each district to carryout supervisory inspection functions and delegated the constructionmanagement to school principals and village education committees.Similarly, the Department of Education of the Philippines mandatedprincipals to take charge of the management of the repair and/orconstruction of typhoon-resistant classrooms after the 2006 typhoons.Assessment, design, and inspection functions were provided by theDepartment’s engineers, who also assist with auditing procurement(World Bank et al., 2009).
9.2.14.3.3. Raising public awareness 
In addition to the insights on the psychological and sociological aspectsof risk perception, risk reduction education has benefited from lessons insocial marketing. These include involving the community and customizingfor audiences using cultural indicators to create ownership; incorporatinglocal community perspectives and aggressively involving communityleaders; enabling two-way communications and speaking with onevoice on messages (particularly if partners are involved); and evaluatingand measuring performance (Frew, 2002). 
According to the UNISDR Hyogo Framework Mid-Term Review (UNISDR,
2011a), few DRR campaigns have translated into public action andgreater accountability. However, successful examples include CentralAmerica and the Caribbean, where the media played an important role,including through radio soap operas. The UNISDR review also found ahigh level of risk acceptance, even among communities demonstratingheightened risk awareness. In some cultures, the spreading of alarmingor negative news – such as information on disaster risks – is frownedupon (UNISDR, 2011a). The following examples from Brazil, Japan, andthe Kashmir region illustrate good practice in raising awareness for riskreduction. 
Between 2007 and 2009, the Brazilian Santa Catarina State Civil
Defence Department, with the support of the Executive Secretariat andthe state university, undertook a public awareness initiative to reducesocial vulnerability to disasters induced by natural phenomena andhuman action (SCSCDD, 2008a,b). During the two-year initiative, 2,000educational kits were distributed free of charge to 1,324 primaryschools. Students also participated in a competition of drawings andslogans that were made into a 2010 calendar. As the project’s goal waspublic awareness of risk, the project jointly launched a communicationsnetwork in partnership with media and social networks to promote betterdissemination of risk and disasters (SCSCDD, 2008a,b). The initiativealso focused on the most vulnerable populations. A pilot project for 16communities precariously perched on a hill prone to landslides featureda 44-hour course on risk reduction. Community participants elaboratedrisk maps and reduction strategies, which they had to put to useimmediately. Shortly into the course, heavy rains battered the state,triggering a state of emergency; 10 houses in the pilot project area hadChapter 9 Case Studies528to be removed and over 50 remained at risk. The participants’ risk
reduction plans highlighted the removal of garbage and large rocks aswell as the building of barriers. The plans also identified public entitiesfor partnership and the costs for services required. The training closedwith a workshop on climate change and with the community leaders’presentation of the major risk reduction lessons learned (SCSCDD,2008c). On international disaster risk reduction day, representatives ofthe community, Civil Defence, and other public entities visited the mostat-risk areas of the hill community, planted trees, installed signs pointingout risky areas and practices, distributed educational pamphlets, anddiscussed risk. One of the topics of discussion was improper refusedisposal and the consequent blocking of drains, causing flooding(SCSCDD, 2008d).
In 2004, typhoons resulted in flooding in urban areas of Saijo City
(Ehime Prefecture of Shikoku Island, Japan). There were also landslidesin the mountains. As a result, a public awareness campaign wasimplemented. Saijo City, a small city with semi-rural mountainous areas,faces challenges in disaster risk reduction that are relatively unique. InJapan, young people have a tendency to leave smaller communities andmove to larger cities. The result is that Japanese smaller towns haveolder than the national average populations. Since younger, able-bodied people are important for community systems of mutual aid andemergency preparedness, there is a special challenge. Saijo City has anurban plain, semi-rural and isolated villages on hills and mountains, anda coastal area and, hence, is spread over a mix of geographic terrains(Yoshida et al., 2009; ICTILO et al., 2010); this brings another challenge.In 2005, the Saijo City Government launched a risk awareness programto meet both of these challenges through a program targeted at schoolchildren. The project for 12-year olds has a ‘mountain-watching’ focusfor the mountainside and a ‘town-watching’ focus for the urban area(ICTILO et al., 2010). The students are taken, accompanied by teachers,forest workers, local residents, and municipal officials, on risk-educationfield trips. In the mountains, the young urban dwellers meet with theelderly and they learn together about the risks the city faces. Part of theprocess is to remember the lessons learned from the 2004 typhoons.Additionally, a ‘mountain and town watching’ handbook has beendeveloped, a teachers’ association for disaster education was formed, akids’ disaster prevention club started, and a disaster prevention forum
for children was set up (Yoshida et al., 2009; ICTILO et al., 2010). This is
an example of a local government both conceiving and implementing theprogram. The city government led a multi-stakeholder and community-
based disaster risk awareness initiative that then became self-sustaining.Professionals from disaster reduction and education departments were
provided through government support. The government also funds thetown and mountain watching and puts on an annual forum (ICTILO et
al., 2010).
The Centre for Environment Education (CEE) Himalaya is undertaking a
disaster risk reduction and climate change education campaign in 2,000
schools and 50 Kashmir villages in the Himalayas. In the schools, teachersand students are involved in vulnerability and risk mapping through
rapid visual risk assessment and in preparing a disaster managementplan for their school. Disaster response teams formed in selected
schools have been trained in life-saving skills and safe evacuation (CEEHimalaya, 2009). 
CEE Himalaya celebrated International Mountain Day 2009 with educa tors
by conducting a week-long series of events on climate change adapta tion
and disaster risk reduction. About 150 participants including teachersand officials of the Department of Education, Ganderbal, participated inthese events (CEE Himalaya, 2009). Participants worked together toidentify climate change impacts in the local context, particularly in termsof water availability, variation in microclimate, impact on agriculture/horticulture and other livelihoods, and vulnerability to natural disasters.The concept of School Disaster Management Plans (SDMPs) wasintroduced. Participants actively prepared SDMPs for their schoolsthrough group exercises, and discussed their opinions about villagecontingency plans (CEE Himalaya, 2009). Some of the observations onimpacts of climate change in the area discussed by participants includedthe melting, shrinking, and even disappearance of some glaciers andthe drying up of several wetlands and perennial springs. Heavydeforestation, decline and extinction of wildlife, heavy soil erosion,siltation of water bodies, fall in crop yields, and reduced availability offodder and other non- timber forest produce were some of the otherrelated issues discussed (CEE Himalaya, 2009). Participants watcheddocumentaries about climate change and played the Urdu version of‘Riskland: Let’s Learn to Prevent Disasters.’ They received educationalkits on disaster risk reduction and on climate change, translated andadapted for Kashmir (CEE Himalaya, 2009).
9.2.14.4. Lessons Identified
The main lesson that can be drawn from the various initiativesdescribed above is that effective DRR education does not occur in a silo.As the examples from Japan, Brazil, and the Himalayas illustrate,successful programs actively engage participants and their widercommunities to elicit risk-reducing behavioral change (Shaw et al., 2004;Wisner, 2006; Bonifacio et al., 2010). Lessons on actively engagingparticipants include:
•Assessing community risk, discussing risk with others, and joininga risk-reducing activity in school or community forums provideopportunities for active learning. Engaging children and communitymembers in vulnerability and capacity assessments has been foundto be effective in disaster risk reduction and adaptation programs(Twigg and Bottomley, 2011; see Himalaya example). 
•Interactive lectures with visual aids can be effective in buildingknowledge (Shaw et al., 2004; see teacher training in Indonesiaexample) and should be followed up with discussion with peersand family – and action – beyond the classroom (Shaw et al., 2004;Wisner, 2006).
Additional lessons of good practice illustrated above include: 
•Integrating climate change information into DRR education and
integrating both into various subject matters is simple and effective.Chapter 9 Case Studies529The Philippines example shows that such integration is underway,
and the teacher training in Indonesia example concludes that suchintegration can be helpful in avoiding overburdening full curricula. 
•Training of teachers and professionals in all relevant sectors can havea positive multiplier effect. As the Nepalese teachers’ evaluationexample shows, teacher training is critical to address risk self-perception and ensure that teachers pass on appropriate DRRknowledge. The training of builders example in Nepal, India, andthe Philippines illustrates the successful dissemination of DRRmethods and tools within a critical sector across borders.
As well as providing further examples of current adaptation and DRR
initiatives, a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changesynthesis report of initiatives undertaken by Nairobi Work Programmepartners concludes that the integration of activities relating to education,training, and awareness-raising into relevant ongoing processes andpractices is key to the long-term success of such activities (UNFCCC, 2010). 
9.3. Synthesis of Lessons
Identified from Case Studies
This chapter examined case studies of extreme climate events, vulnerable
regions, and methodological management approaches in order to gleanlessons and good practices. Case studies are provided to add contextand value to this report. They contribute to a focused analysis and convey,
in part, the reality of an event: the description of how certain extremeevents develop; the extent of human loss and financial damage; theresponse strategies and interventions; the DRR, DRM, and CCA measuresand their effect on the overall outcomes; and cultural or region-specificfactors that may influence the outcome. Most importantly, case studiesprovide a medium through which to learn practical lessons aboutsuccesses in DRR that are applicable for adaptation to climate change.The lessons identified will prove useful at various levels from theindividual to national and international organizations as people try torespond to extreme events and disasters and adapt to climate change.
The case studies highlight several recurring themes and lessons. 
A common factor was the need for greater amounts of useful informa tion
on risks before the events occur, including early warnings. Theimplementation of early warning systems does reduce loss of lives andto a lesser extent damage to property. Early warning was identified byall the extreme event case studies – heat waves, wildfires, drought,
dzud , cyclones, floods, and epidemics – as key to reducing the impacts
from extreme events. A need for improving international cooperation andinvestments in forecasting was recognized in some of the case studies,
but equally the need for regional and local early warning systems was
heavily emphasized, particularly in developing countries. 
A further common factor identified overall was that it is better to invest
in preventive-based DRR plans, strategies, and tools for adaptation thanin response to extreme events. Greater investments in proactive hazardand vulnerability reduction measures, as well as development of capac ities
to respond and recover from the events were demonstrated to havebenefits. Specific examples for planning for extreme events includedincreased emphasis on drought preparedness; planning for urban heatwaves; and tropical cyclone DRM strategies and plans in coastal regionsthat anticipate these events. However, as illustrated by the SIDS casestudy, it was also identified that DRR planning approaches continue toreceive less emphasis than disaster relief and recovery.
It was also identified that DRM and preventive public health are closely
linked and largely synonymous. Strengthening and integrating these
measures, along with economic development, should increase resilienceagainst the health effects of extreme weather and facilitate adaptationto climate change. Extreme weather events and population vulnerabilitycan interact to produce disastrous epidemic disease through directeffects on the transmission cycle and also potentially through indirecteffects, such as population displacement.
Another lesson is that in order to implement a successful DRR or CCA
strategy, legal and regulatory frameworks are beneficial in ensuringdirection, coordination, and effective use of funds. The case studies arehelpful in this endeavor as effective and implemented legislation cancreate a framework for governance of disaster risks. While this type ofapproach is mainly for national governments and the ways in whichthey devolve responsibilities to local administrations, there is animportant message for international governance and institutions as well.Frameworks that facilitate cooperation with other countries to attainbetter analysis of the risks will allow institutions to modify their focuswith changing risks and therefore maintain their effectiveness. Thiscooperation could be at the local through national to internationallevels. Here and in other ways, civil society has an important role.
Insurance and other forms of risk transfer can be linked to disaster risk
reduction and climate change adaptation by providing knowledge andincentives for reducing risk, reducing vulnerability, and enabling recov ery.
A lesson identified by many case studies was that effective DRR education
contributes to reduce risks and losses, and is most effective when it isnot done in isolation, but concurs with other policies. The integration ofactivities relating to education, training, and awareness-raising intorelevant ongoing processes and practices is important for the long-termsuccess of DRR and DRM activities. Investing in knowledge at primaryto higher education levels produces significant DRR and DRM benefits.
Research improves our knowledge, especially when it includes integra tion
of natural, social, health, and engineering sciences and their applications.
In all cases, the point was made that with greater information availableit would be possible to better understand the risks and to ensure thatresponse strategies were adequate to face the risks. It further poses aset of questions to guide the investigations.
The case studies have reviewed past events and identified lessons that
could be considered for the future. Preparedness through DDR and DRMChapter 9 Case Studies530can help to adapt for climate change and these case studies offer
examples of measures that could be taken to reduce the damage that isinflicted as a result of extreme events. Investment in increasingknowledge and warning systems, adaptation techniques and tools, andpreventive measures will cost money now but they will save money andlives in the future.Asante , K.O., J.S.

IPCC , 2012: Glossary of terms. In: Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation
[Field, C.B., V . Barros, T.F . Stocker, D. Qin, D.J. Dokken, K.L. Ebi, M.D. Mastrandrea, K.J. Mach, G.-K. Plattner, S.K. Allen,
M. Tignor, and P .M. Midgley (eds.)]. A Special Report of Working Groups I and II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, NY , USA, pp. 555-564.Glossary of TermsIIANNEX556Abrupt climate change 
The nonlinearity of the climate system may lead to abrupt climate
change, sometimes called rapid climate change, abrupt events, or evensurprises. The term abrupt often refers to time scales faster than thetypical time scale of the responsible forcing. However, not all abruptclimate changes need be externally forced. Some changes may be trulyunexpected, resulting from a strong, rapidly changing forcing of anonlinear system. 
Adaptation
In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expectedclimate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficialopportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actualclimate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment toexpected climate.
Adaptation assessment 
The practice of identifying options to adapt to climate change andevaluating them in terms of criteria such as availability, benefits, costs,effectiveness, efficiency, and feasibility. 
Adaptive capacity 
The combination of the strengths, attributes, and resources available toan individual, community, society, or organization that can be used toprepare for and undertake actions to reduce adverse impacts, moderateharm, or exploit beneficial opportunities.
Aerosols
A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical sizebetween 0.01 and 10 μm, that reside in the atmosphere for at leastseveral hours. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenicorigin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways: directly throughscattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly by acting as cloudcondensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties and lifetime ofclouds.
Albedo 
The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object, often
expressed as a percentage. Snow-covered surfaces have a high albedo,the surface albedo of soils ranges from high to low, and vegetation-covered surfaces and oceans have a low albedo. The Earth’s planetary
albedo varies mainly through varying cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf area,
and land cover changes. 
Anthropogenic
Resulting from or produced by human beings. 
Anthropogenic emissions
Emissions of greenhouse gases, greenhouse gas precursors, and aerosols
associated with human activities. These activities include the burning of
fossil fuels, deforestation, land use changes, livestock, fertilization, etc.,
that result in a net increase in emissions.Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO)
A multi-decadal (65- to 75-year) fluctuation in the North Atlantic, inwhich sea surface temperatures showed warm phases during roughly1860 to 1880 and 1930 to 1960 and cool phases during 1905 to 1925and 1970 to 1990 with a range of the order of 0.4°C.
Atmosphere 
The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphereconsists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) andoxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of tracegases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium, and radiativelyactive greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixingratio) and ozone. In addition, the atmosphere contains the greenhousegas water vapor, whose amounts are highly variable but typicallyaround 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains cloudsand aerosols. 
Available potential energy 
That portion of the total potential energy that may be converted tokinetic energy in an adiabatically enclosed system.
Baseline/reference
The baseline (or reference) is the state against which change is meas ured.
It might be a ‘current baseline,’ in which case it represents observable,present-day conditions. It might also be a ‘future baseline,’ which is aprojected future set of conditions excluding the driving factor of interest.Alternative interpretations of the reference conditions can give rise tomultiple baselines. 
Capacity
The combination of all the strengths, attributes, and resources availableto an individual, community, society, or organization, which can be usedto achieve established goals.
Carbon cycle 
The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as
carbon dioxide) through the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial biosphere,
and lithosphere. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
A naturally occurring gas fixed by photosynthesis into organic matter.
A byproduct of fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning, it is alsoemitted from land use changes and other industrial processes. It is theprincipal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth’s radiativebalance. It is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gasesare measured, thus having a Global Warming Potential of 1. 
Catchment
An area that collects and drains precipitation. 
Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (or equation) 
The differential equation relating the pressure of a substance (usuallyGlossary of Terms Annex II557water vapor) to temperature in a system in which two phases of the
substance (water) are in equilibrium. 
Climate 
Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, ormore rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean andvariability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from monthsto thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averagingthese variables is 30 years, as defined by the World MeteorologicalOrganization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variablessuch as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider senseis the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. Invarious chapters in this report different averaging periods, such as aperiod of 20 years, are also used. 
Climate change 
A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., byusing statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variabilityof its properties and that persists for an extended period, typicallydecades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internalprocesses or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changesin the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.

Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) 
The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (orbelow) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range ofobserved values of the variable. For simplicity, both extreme weatherevents and extreme climate events are referred to collectively as ‘climateextremes.’ The full definition is provided in Section 3.1.2. 
Climate feedback 
An interaction mechanism between processes in the climate system iscalled a climate feedback when the result of an initial process triggerschanges in a second process that in turn influences the initial one. Apositive feedback intensifies the original process, and a negative feedbackreduces it. 
Climate model 
A numerical representation of the climate system that is based on the
physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their
interactions, and feedback processes, and that accounts for all or some ofits known properties. The climate system can be represented by models
of varying complexity, that is, for any one component or combination ofcomponents a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing
in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to whichphysical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, orthe level at which empirical parameterizations are involved. CoupledAtmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models (AOGCMs), also referred to asAtmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models, provide a representationof the climate system that is near the most comprehensive end of thespectrum currently available. There is an evolution toward more complexmodels with interactive chemistry and biology. Climate models areapplied as a research tool to study and simulate the climate, and foroperational purposes, including monthly, seasonal, and interannual climatepredictions.
Climate projection 
A projection of the response of the climate system to emissions orconcentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiativeforcing scenarios, often based upon simulations by climate models.Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions in orderto emphasize that climate projections depend upon the emission/concentration/radiative-forcing scenario used, which are based onassumptions concerning, e.g., future socioeconomic and technologicaldevelopments that may or may not be realized and are thereforesubject to substantial uncertainty. 
Climate scenario 
A plausible and often simplified representation of the future climate,based on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships thathas been constructed for explicit use in investigating the potentialconsequences of anthropogenic climate change, often serving as inputto impact models. Climate projections often serve as the raw materialfor constructing climate scenarios, but climate scenarios usually requireadditional information such as about the observed current climate. 
Climate system 
The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five majorcomponents: the atmosphere, the oceans, the cryosphere, the landsurface, the biosphere, and the interactions between them. The climatesystem evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamicsand because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solarvariations, and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing compositionof the atmosphere and land use change. 
Climate threshold

Climate variability 
Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and otherstatistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) ofthe climate at all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individualweather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processeswithin the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in naturalAnnex II Glossary of Terms
____________
1This definition differs from that in the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), where climate change is defined as: “a change of climate
which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition
of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time period s.” The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction
between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmosphericcomposition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.558or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability). See also Climate

Convection 
Vertical motion driven by buoyancy forces arising from static instability,usually caused by near-surface cooling or increases in salinity in the caseof the ocean and near-surface warming in the case of the atmosphere.At the location of convection, the horizontal scale is approximately thesame as the vertical scale, as opposed to the large contrast betweenthese scales in the general circulation. The net vertical mass transport isusually much smaller than the upward and downward exchange.

Detection and attribution 
Climate varies continually on all time scales. Detection of climate
change is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in
some defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that
change. Attribution of causes of climate change is the process of
establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with somedefined level of confidence.

Downscaling is a method that derives local- to regional-scale (up to100 km) information from larger-scale models or data analyses. The fulldefinition is provided in Section 3.2.3. 
Drought 
A period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serioushydrological imbalance. Drought is a relative term (see Box 3-3),therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit must refer tothe particular precipitation-related activity that is under discussion. Forexample, shortage of precipitation during the growing season impingeson crop production or ecosystem function in general (due to soil mois tureGlossary of Terms Annex II559drought, also termed agricultural drought), and during the runoff and
percolation season primarily affects water supplies (hydrological drought).Storage changes in soil moisture and groundwater are also affected byincreases in actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions inprecipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined asa meteorological drought. A megadrought is a very lengthy and pervasivedrought, lasting much longer than normal, usually a decade or more. 
Early warning system
The set of capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely andmeaningful warning information to enable individuals, communities, andorganizations threatened by a hazard to prepare and to act appropriatelyand in sufficient time to reduce the possibility of harm or loss. 
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
The term El Niño was initially used to describe a warm-water currentthat periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting thelocal fishery. It has since become identified with a basin-wide warmingof the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic event isassociated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropicalsurface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupledatmosphere-ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of 2 toabout 7 years, is collectively known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference betweenDarwin and Tahiti and the sea surface temperatures in the central andeastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing tradewinds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents suchthat the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the tradewinds. This event has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature,and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effectsthroughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world,through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La Niña. 
Emissions scenario 
A plausible representation of the future development of emissions ofsubstances that are potentially radiatively active (e.g., greenhouse gases,aerosols), based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptionsabout driving forces (such as technological change, demographic andsocioeconomic development) and their key relationships. Concentration
scenarios, derived from emissions scenarios, are used as input to a climate
model to compute climate projections. In the IPCC 1992 SupplementaryReport, a set of emissions scenarios was presented, which were used asa basis for the climate projections in the IPCC Second Assessment Report.These emissions scenarios are referred to as the IS92 scenarios. In theIPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, new emissions scenarios, theso-called SRES scenarios, were published. SRES scenarios (e.g., A1B,
A1FI, A2, B1, B2) are used as a basis for some of the climate projections
shown in Chapter 3 of this report. 
Ensemble 
A group of parallel model simulations used for climate projections.
Variation of the results across the ensemble members gives an estimateof uncertainty. Ensembles made with the same model but different
initial conditions only characterize the uncertainty associated withinternal climate variability, whereas multi-model ensembles includingsimulations by several models also include the impact of modeldifferences. Perturbed parameter ensembles, in which model parametersare varied in a systematic manner, aim to produce a more objectiveestimate of modeling uncertainty than is possible with traditional multi-model ensembles.
Evapotranspiration

Extratropical cyclone 
Any cyclonic-scale storm that is not a tropical cyclone. Usually refers toa middle- or high-latitude migratory storm system formed in regions oflarge horizontal temperature variations. Sometimes called extratropicalstorm or extratropical low. 
Extreme coastal high water (also referred to as extreme sea level)
Extreme coastal high water depends on average sea level, tides, andregional weather systems. Extreme coastal high water events areusually defined in terms of the higher percentiles (e.g., 90th to 99.9th)of a distribution of hourly values of observed sea level at a station for agiven reference period.
Extreme weather or climate event
See Climate extreme .

Floods include river (fluvial) floods, flash floods, urbanfloods, pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and glacial lakeoutburst floods. Annex II Glossary of Terms560Frozen ground 
Soil or rock in which part or all of the pore water is frozen. Perennially
frozen ground is called permafrost. Ground that freezes and thawsannually is called seasonally frozen ground. 
Glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF)
Flood associated with outburst of glacial la ke. Glacial lake outburst
floods are typically a result of cumulative developments and occur (i)only once (e.g., full breach failure of moraine-dammed lakes), (ii) for thefirst time (e.g., new formation and outburst of glacial lakes), and/or (iii)repeatedly (e.g., ice-dammed lakes with drainage cycles, or ice fall). 
Glacier 
A mass of land ice that flows downhill under gravity (through internaldeformation and/or sliding at the base) and is constrained by internalstress and friction at the base and sides. A glacier is maintained byaccumulation of snow at high altitudes, balanced by melting at lowaltitudes or discharge into the sea. 
Global climate model (also referred to asgeneral circulation model, both abbreviated as GCM)
See Climate model .
Global surface temperature 
The global surface temperature is an estimate of the global mean surfaceair temperature. However, for changes over time, only anomalies, asdepartures from a climatology, are used, most commonly based on thearea-weighted global average of the sea surface temperature anomalyand land surface air temperature anomaly. 
Governance 
The way government is understood has changed in response to social,economic, and technological changes over recent decades. There is acorresponding shift from government defined strictly by the nation-stateto a more inclusive concept of governance, recognizing the contributionsof various levels of government (global, international, regional, local)and the roles of the private sector, of nongovernmental actors, and ofcivil society. 
Greenhouse effect 
Greenhouse gases effectively absorb thermal infrared radiation, emittedby the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases,
and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including
downward to the Earth’s surface. Thus, greenhouse gases trap heatwithin the surface-troposphere system. This is called the greenhouse
effect. Thermal infrared radiation in the troposphere is strongly coupled
to the temperature of the atmosphere at the altitude at which it is
emitted. In the troposphere, the temperature generally decreases withheight. Effectively, infrared radiation emitted to space originates from
an altitude with a temperature of, on average, -19°C, in balance withthe net incoming solar radiation, whereas the Earth’s surface is kept ata much higher temperature of, on average, 14°C. An increase in theconcentration of greenhouse gases leads to an increased infrared
opacity of the atmosphere and therefore to an effective radiation intospace from a higher altitude at a lower temperature. This causes aradiative forcing that leads to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect,the so-called enhanced greenhouse effect. 
Greenhouse gas 
Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere,both natural and anthropogenic, which absorb and emit radiation atspecific wavelengths within the spectrum of thermal infrared radiationemitted by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds.This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor (H
2O), carbon
dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and ozone (O3) are
the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover,there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in theatmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. BesidesCO
2, N2O, and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons
(PFCs).

Warm spell .
Holocene 
The Holocene geological epoch is the latter of two Quaternary epochs,extending from about 11.6 thousand years before present to andincluding the present. 
Human security 
Human security can be said to have two main aspects. It means, first,safety from such chronic threats as hunger, disease, and repression. Andsecond, it means protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in thepatterns of daily life – whether in homes, in jobs, or in communities.Such threats can exist at all levels of national income and development. 
Hydrological cycle (also referred to as water cycle)
The cycle in which water evaporates from the oceans and the landsurface, is carried over the Earth in atmospheric circulation as watervapor, condenses to form clouds, precipitates again as rain or snow, isintercepted by trees and vegetation, provides runoff on the land surface,infiltrates into soils, recharges groundwater, and/or discharges intostreams and flows out into the oceans, and ultimately evaporates againfrom the oceans or land surface. The various systems involved in thehydrological cycle are usually referred to as hydrological systems.Glossary of Terms Annex II561Impacts

The air temperature as measured in well-ventilated screens over land at1.5 to 2 m above the ground. 
Land use and land use change
Land use refers to the total of arrangements, activities, and inputsundertaken in a certain land cover type (a set of human actions). Theterm land use is also used in the sense of the social and economicpurposes for which land is managed (e.g., grazing, timber extraction,and conservation). Land use change refers to a change in the use ormanagement of land by humans, which may lead to a change in landcover. Land cover and land use change may have an impact on thesurface albedo, evapotranspiration, sources and sinks of greenhousegases, or other properties of the climate system and may thus haveradiative forcing and/or other impacts on climate, locally or globally.

with height. The lapse rate is considered positive when the variable
decreases with height.

LDRM normally requires coordination with andsupport from external actors at the regional, national, or internationallevels. Community-based disaster risk management is a subset ofLDRM where community members and organizations are in the centerof decisionmaking.
Mass movement
Mass movement in the context of mountainous phenomena refers todifferent types of mass transport processes including landslides,avalanches, rock fall, or debris flows .

it is situated. Mean sea level is normally defined as the average relative sealevel over a period, such as a month or a year, long enough to average outtransients such as waves and tides. See 
Sea level change . 
Meridional overturning circulation (MOC) 
Meridional (north-south) overturning circulation in the ocean quantifiedby zonal (east-west) sums of mass transports in depth or density layers.In the North Atlantic, away from the subpolar regions, the MOC (whichis in principle an observable quantity) is often identified with thethermohaline circulation, which is a conceptual interpretation. However,it must be borne in mind that MOC can also include shallower, wind-driven overturning cells such as occur in the upper ocean in the tropicsand subtropics, in which warm (less dense) waters moving poleward aretransformed to slightly denser waters and subducted equatorward atdeeper levels. 
Mitigation (of disaster risk and disaster)
The lessening of the potential adverse impacts of physical hazards(including those that are human-induced) through actions that reducehazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

Modes of climate variability 
Natural variability of the climate system, in particular on seasonal andlonger time scales, predominantly occurs with preferred spatial patternsAnnex II Glossary of Terms562and time scales, through the dynamical characteristics of the atmos pheric
circulation and through interactions with the land and ocean surfaces.Such patterns are often called regimes, modes, or teleconnections.Examples are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific-NorthAmerican pattern (PNA), the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), theNorthern Annular Mode (NAM; previously called the Arctic Oscillation,AO), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM; previously called theAntarctic Oscillation, AAO). 
Monsoon 
A monsoon is a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both thesurface winds and associated precipitation, caused by differentialheating between a continental-scale land mass and the adjacent ocean.Monsoon rains occur mainly over land in summer. 
Nonlinearity 
A process is called nonlinear when there is no simple proportionalrelation between cause and effect. The climate system contains manysuch nonlinear processes, resulting in a system with a potentially verycomplex behavior. Such complexity may lead to abrupt climate change.See also 
Predictability . 
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
The North Atlantic Oscillation consists of opposing variations in barometricpressure near Iceland and near the Azores. It therefore corresponds tofluctuations in the strength of the main westerly winds across theAtlantic into Europe, and thus to fluctuations in the embedded cycloneswith their associated frontal systems. 
Northern Annular Mode (NAM)

NAMhas links with the northern polar vortex into the stratosphere. Itspattern has a bias to the North Atlantic and has a large correlation withthe North Atlantic Oscillation. 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) 
The pattern and time series of the first empirical orthogonal function of
sea surface temperature over the North Pacific north of 20°N. PDObroadened to cover the whole Pacific Basin is known as the Inter-decadalPacific Oscillation (IPO). The PDO and IPO exhibit virtually identicaltemporal evolution. 
Parameterization 
In climate models, this term refers to the technique of representing
processes that cannot be explicitly resolved at the spatial or temporalresolution of the model (sub-grid scale processes) by relationships
between model-resolved larger-scale flow and the area- or time-aver aged
effect of such sub-grid scale processes.
Percentile 
A percentile is a value on a scale of 100 that indicates the percentageof the data set values that is equal to or below it. The percentile is often

Probability density function (PDF) 
A probability density function is a function that indicates the relativechances of occurrence of different outcomes of a variable. The functionintegrates to unity over the domain for which it is defined and has theproperty that the integral over a sub-domain equals the probability thatthe outcome of the variable lies within that sub-domain. For example,the probability that a temperature anomaly defined in a particular wayis greater than zero is obtained from its PDF by integrating the PDFover all possible temperature anomalies greater than zero. Probabilitydensity functions that describe two or more variables simultaneouslyare similarly defined. 
Projection 
A projection is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set ofquantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Projections aredistinguished from predictions in order to emphasize that projectionsinvolve assumptions concerning, for example, future socioeconomic andtechnological developments that may or may not be realized, and aretherefore subject to substantial uncertainty. See also 
Climate projection
and Climate prediction . 
Proxy climate indicator
A proxy climate indicator is a local record that is interpreted, usingphysical and biophysical principles, to represent some combination ofclimate-related variations back in time. Climate-related data derived inthis way are referred to as proxy data. Examples of proxies includepollen analysis, tree ring records, characteristics of corals, and variousdata derived from ice cores. The term ‘proxy’ can also be used to referto indirect estimates of present-day conditions, for example, in theabsence of observations.
Radiative forcing 
Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus upward,irradiance (expressed in W m
–2) at the tropopause due to a change in
an external driver of climate change, such as, for example, a change inthe concentration of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun. Radiativeforcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at theirunperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures,if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. RadiativeGlossary of Terms Annex II563forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature
is accounted for. For the purposes of this report, radiative forcing isfurther defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unlessotherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average value. Radiativeforcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, a similarterminology for describing an unrelated measure of the impact ofclouds on the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere. 
Reanalysis 
Reanalyses are atmospheric and oceanic analyses of temperature, wind,current, and other meteorological and oceanographic quantities, createdby processing past meteorological and oceanographic data using fixedstate-of-the-art weather forecasting models and data assimilationtechniques. Using fixed data assimilation avoids effects from thechanging analysis system that occur in operational analyses. Althoughcontinuity is improved, global reanalyses still suffer from changingcoverage and biases in the observing systems.

Sea level change
Changes in sea level, globally or locally, due to (i) changes in the shapeof the ocean basins, (ii) changes in the total mass and distribution ofwater and land ice, (iii) changes in water density, and (iv) changes inocean circulation.

Density changes induced by temperaturechanges only are called thermosteric, while density changes induced bysalinity changes are called halosteric. See also 
Mean sea level .
Sea surface temperature (SST) 
The sea surface temperature is the temperature of the subsurface bulk
temperature in the top few meters of the ocean, measured by ships,
buoys, and drifters. From ships, measurements of water samples inbuckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from engine intakewater. Satellite measurements of skin temperature (uppermost layer; afraction of a millimeter thick) in the infrared or the top centimeter or soin the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatiblewith the bulk temperature.

Subsidiarity
The principle that decisions of government (other things being equal) arebest made and implemented, if possible, at the lowest most decentralizedlevel closest to the citizen. Subsidiarity is designed to strengthenaccountability and reduce the dangers of making decisions in placesremote from their point of application.

The general term for a strong, cyclonic-scale disturbance that originatesover tropical oceans. Distinguished from weaker systems (often namedtropical disturbances or depressions) by exceeding a threshold windspeed. A tropical storm is a tropical cyclone with one-minute average
surface winds between 18 and 32 m s
-1. Beyond 32 m s-1, a tropical
cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone, depending ongeographic location.Uncertainty 
An expression of the degree to which a value or relationship isunknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of information or fromdisagreement about what is known or even knowable. Uncertainty mayoriginate from many sources, such as quantifiable errors in the data,ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projectionsof human behavior. Uncertainty can therefore be represented byquantitative measures, for example, a range of values calculated byvarious models, or by qualitative statements, for example, reflecting thejudgment of a team of experts.

Likelihood and Confidence . 
Urban heat island 
The relative warmth of a city compared with surrounding rural areas,associated with changes in runoff, the concrete jungle effects on heatretention, changes in surface albedo, changes in pollution and aerosols,and so on. 
Vulnerability
The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected.
Warm days/warm nights 
Days where maximum temperature, or nights where minimumtemperature, exceeds the 90th percentile, where the respectivetemperature distributions are generally defined with respect to the1961-1990 reference period.
Warm spell
A period of abnormally warm weather. Heat waves and warm spellshave various and in some cases overlapping definitions. See also
