Abstract
Deep Learning has recently emerged as a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù prognosis downscaling tech-
nique to compute high-resolution Ô¨Åelds from large-scale coarse atmospheric data.
Despite their promising results to reproduce the observed local variability, they are
based on the estimation of independent distributions at each location, which leads
to deÔ¨Åcient spatial structures, especially when downscaling precipitation. This
study proposes the use of generative models to improve the spatial consistency
of the high-resolution Ô¨Åelds, very demanded by some sectoral applications (e.g.,
hydrology) to tackle climate change.
1 Motivations for generative models in ‚Äúperfect‚Äù prognosis downscaling
Global Climate Models (GCMs) are the main tools used nowadays to study the evolution of climate
at different time-scales. They numerically solve a set of equations describing the dynamics of the
climate system over a three-dimensional grid (latitude-longitude-height). In climate change modeling,
these models are utilized to produce possible future pathways of the climate system based on different
natural and anthropogenic forcings. However, due to computational limitations these models present
a coarse spatial resolution ‚Äîbetween 1and3,‚Äî which leads to a misrepresentation of important
phenomena occurring at Ô¨Åner scales. The generation of high-resolution climate projections is crucial
for important socio-economic activities (e.g., the energy industry), and they are routinely used to
elaborate mitigation and adaptation politics to climate change at a regional scale.
Statistical Downscaling (SD) is used to bridge the scale-gap between the coarse model outputs and
the local-scale by learning empirical relationships between a set of large-scale variables (predictors)
and the regional variable of interest (predictands) based on large simulated/observational historical
data records [ 1]. In this study we focus on a speciÔ¨Åc type of SD, named the ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù Prognosis
(PP) approach. PP downscaling leans on observational datasets to learn empirical relationships
linking the predictors and the predictands. For the former, reanalysis data ‚Äîa global dataset which
combines observations with short-range forecasts through data assimilation,‚Äî is typically used,
whilst for the latter either high-resolution grids or station-scale records can be employed. Once
the relationship is established in these ‚Äúperfect‚Äù conditions, we feed the model/algorithm with the
equivalent GCM predictor variables to obtain high-resolution climate projections. A wide variety of
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.statistical techniques have been deployed to establish these links, such as (generalized) linear models
[2], support vector machines [ 3], random forests [ 4], classical neural networks [ 5], and more recently
deep learning (DL). In particular, DL has recently emerged as a promising PP technique, showing
capabilities to reproduce the observed local climate [ 6,7,8], whilst showing plausible climate
change projections of precipitation and temperature Ô¨Åelds over Europe [ 9]. Nonetheless, currently
the regression-based nature of most of the existing PP methods, leads to an underestimation of the
extremes when the predictors lack from sufÔ¨Åcient informative power ‚Äîi.e., given a particular predictor
conÔ¨Åguration there are many possible predictand situations,‚Äî since they output the conditional mean
[10]. To account for the uncertainty describing the possible extremes is crucial for some activities, and
the community has driven its attention to probabilistic regression-based modeling. The probabilistic
models used mostly estimate the parameters of selected probability distributions conditioned to
the large-scale atmospheric situation. The choice of the distribution depends on the variable of
interest to be modeled ‚Äîfor instance, the temperature follows a Gaussian distribution, whilst wind
or precipitation Ô¨Åelds present a heavy-tailed structure which better Ô¨Åts with Gamma, Poisson or
log-normal density functions,‚Äî and the regression-based models are trained to optimize the negative
log-likelihood of the selected distribution at each site [ 5,7,11,12,13]. To model the spatial
dependencies among sites, ideally we would estimate multivariate distributions representing the
whole predictand domain, instead of predicting independent probability functions at each predictand
site. Nonetheless, this was in practice computationally intractable, and very few procedures aimed to
downscale over low-dimensional predictand spaces have been successfully deployed [14, 15, 16].
Recently, deep generative models have been developed that seek to approximate high-dimensional
distributions through DL topologies. Based on previous merits in other disciplines, such as image-
super-resolution (see e.g., [ 17,18]), some studies have searched for an analogy between this task
and downscaling, deploying Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN, [ 19,20]) to obtain stochastic
samples of high-resolution precipitation and temperature Ô¨Åelds conditioned to their counterpart
low-resolution ones. Despite these Ô¨Årst studies are far from the PP approach, ‚Äîsince they lean on
surface variables in their predictor set, which are not well represented by GCMs (see [ 1,21] for
guidelines/details on PP),‚Äî they show the potential of generative models to attain impressive levels
of spatial structure in their stochastic downscaled predictions. Following this idea, we state that these
topologies may provide a tractable alternative to model multivariate conditional distributions over
high-dimensional domains in a PP setting, providing stochastic and spatially consistent downscaled
Ô¨Åelds very demanded by some sectoral applications for climate impact studies. To prove the potential
of this type of DL topologies for PP-based downscaling, we show in the next section a use-case where
Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (CV AE) are deployed to produce stochastic high-resolution
precipitation Ô¨Åelds over Europe.
2 A downscaling case study over Europe with CVAE
We develop a simple use-case1which seeks to illustrate the promising capabilities of CV AE topologies
to generate spatially consistent stochastic downscaled Ô¨Åelds, especially as compared to the recent
state-of-the-art PP DL-based topologies, which are based on the estimation of conditional Bernoulli-
Gamma distributions at each predictand site (we refer the reader to [ 7] for more details). To this
aim, we deploy the CV AE in the same conditions than [ 7], which builds on the validation framework
proposed in the COST action V ALUE [ 22]. V ALUE proposes the use of ERA-Interim [ 23] reanalysis
variables as predictors ‚Äîtrimmed to an horizontal resolution of 2o,‚Äî and the regular gridded 0:5o
E-OBS dataset [ 24] as predictand. For the predictor set we use Ô¨Åve thermodynamical variables
(geopotential height, zonal and meridional wind, temperature, and speciÔ¨Åc humidity) at four different
vertical levels (1000, 850, 700 and 500 hPa), whilst as predictand we use the daily accumulated
precipitation over Europe. The models are trained on the period 1979-2002 and tested on 2003-2008.
Figure 1 shows the scheme of the CV AE proposed. This models builds on three different neural
networks ‚Äîan embedding network, an encoder and a decoder,‚Äî to produce stochastic samples of
precipitation by sampling from a latent distribution which represents the complex interactions between
predictors and predictands. During training, the embedding network transforms the high-dimensional
predictorsXto a low-dimensional array zx. This array is then stacked with the high-resolution
predictand Ô¨Åelds Yto feed the encoder network. The encoder outputs the parameters of a Gaussian
distribution (i.e., the mean and the standard deviation ), which encodes the spatial dependencies

between both predictor and predictand Ô¨Åelds. During both training and inference phases, stochastic
realizations zsampled from this latent distribution are stacked with the low-dimensional predictor‚Äôs
embedding zx. This is used to feed the decoder network, which outputs the precipitation values bY
at each E-OBS predictand site considered. Therefore, different samples bYconditioned on the same
large-scale atmospheric situation Xcan be generated by sampling different vectors zfrom the latent
distribution (see the three maps obtained for a particular day). We refer the reader to [ 25] for more
details on CV AE.
For the sake of comparison, we select CNN1, which was one of the models that ranked Ô¨Årst in [ 7], as
an example of univariate model and compare its stochastic downscaled Ô¨Åelds with those of CV AE. It
can be seen how CNN1 Ô¨Åelds present a spotty structure, characteristic of the sampling performed
over the independent Bernoulli-Gamma distributions at each E-OBS site. In contrast, CV AE does not
suffer from this problem improving the spatial consistency of the downscaled Ô¨Åelds, as can be seen in
the smoothness of the predictions.
3 Pathway of generative models to tackle climate change
Overall, we have showed the ability of CV AEs to produce spatially consistent stochastic Ô¨Åelds in PP
setups on a use-case over Europe. The generation of these high-resolution Ô¨Åelds through generative
models may foster the use of this type of downscaling into climate impact studies, since their products
are very demanded by different sectors (e.g., agriculture, hydrology) to tackle climate change. In this
3line there are several challenges to address. For instance further research is needed in the evaluation
of these models on aspects such as temporal consistency, and reproducibility of extremes. Also, in
order to apply them to climate change projections, a study of its extrapolation capabilities is also
required. The CV AE model developed here is a Ô¨Årst approach, but further tuning this architecture
may translate in improvements in the generated downscaled Ô¨Åelds. For example, [ 26,27] propose the
use of normalizing Ô¨Çows to generate more complex latent distributions which could help capturing
the complex non-linearities of the distribution of precipitation Ô¨Åelds. Finally, the DL ecosystem offers
a wide catalog of additional topologies which are of interest for PP downscaling (e.g., Conditional
GANs [28]).
