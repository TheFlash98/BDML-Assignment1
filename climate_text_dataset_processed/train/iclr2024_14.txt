ABSTRACT
Expanding renewable energy generation and electrifying heating to address climate
change will heighten the exposure of our power systems to the variability of weather.
Planning and assessing these future systems typically lean on past weather data.
We spotlight the pitfalls of this approach—chiefly its reliance on what we claim
is a limited weather record—and propose a novel approach: to evaluate these
systems on two orders of magnitude more weather scenarios. By repurposing past
ensemble weather predictions, we not only drastically expand the known weather
distribution—notably its extreme tails—for traditional power system modeling but
also unveil its potential to enable data-intensive self-supervised, diffusion-based
and optimization ML techniques. Building on our methodology, we introduce
adataset collected from ECMWF ENS forecasts, encompassing power-system
relevant variables over Europe, and detail the intricate process behind its assembly.
1 I NTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
To address climate change we need to electrify large parts of our society and decarbonize the
electricity grid. With an uncertain future of nuclear power in Europe [1] and the US [2], it can be
expected that a large portion of electricity generation will come from the other source of carbon-free
electricity: renewable technologies including photovoltaics, on-shore and off-shore wind turbines
and hydro-power. Together with a much larger temperature dependency of electricity demand, as the
electrification of heating goes underway, the behaviour of these future power systems will be largely
driven by weather [3].
1.1 W EATHER IN POWER SYSTEMS PLANNING
Traditionally, power system planning didn’t examine weather since the power generation was con-
trollable and responded to demand. Later, the growing seasonal signal in load and other parts of the
system, begun to be supplied through a representative year . This practice is still prevalent in power
system engineering, as evidenced by the latest guidelines of the European transmission coordinator
for their ten year development cycle, which considered 30 years of weather but ultimately only chose
3 specific years (1995, 2008 and 2009) to act as the climate representative years [4, p. 15]. Studies
focusing on renewable generation usually consider several years of historical data, often taken from
reanalyses [5, 6], which assimilate observed data onto easy-to-use grids.
It’s crucial to recognize that, as we’re designing and planning weather-dependent systems for the
next 5-20 years, we simply don’t know what the weather will be. We have to treat future weather as a
probability distribution of possible scenarios, in which our power system still needs to function.
As shown above, this distribution is often implicitly constructed directly from the existing weather
record. When considering a small scale study (such as a single wind turbine), then the weather
record can provide a reasonably detailed histogram of the conditions that can occur, however, in
continental-scale power-system studies considering many aspects of the weather, the input space

all possible inputs to the model, blue sheet the subspace/distribution of plausible physical scenarios,
and the blue and red lines different ways to estimate this subspace. The weather record (blue) forms
a single continuous trace but covers the distribution sparsely. The Ensemble forecasts (red) are
regularly initiated from the weather record, but due to chaos in the system, they diverge and predict
different plausible weather situations. Due to their numbers the ensemble predictions provide a much
more thorough coverage.
grows exponentially (Fig. 1a) and the existing 40 or 80 *years of weather record isn’t enough to cover
the variability of the weather system, including all its spatial correlations (Fig. 1b).
By its definition, climate change also shifts of this distribution, leaving older weather records
potentially less informative of the future. While global climate/circulation models (GCMs) aim to
project future weather patterns, they had prioritized different objectives, resulting in granularity that
often falls short of what’s needed here. This gap between energy system and climate modeling has
been brought front and centre by Craig et al. [9],
The approach we present offers a powerful compromise. By leveraging the past ("expired") ensemble
weather forecasts , we build the distribution not just based on what has happened, but also what could
have happened (Fig. 1c). We can provide over 10 000 years of independent weather scenarios with
higher fidelity than GCMs; and, although derived from past conditions, since they cover the last two
decades, these forecasts reflect an atmosphere already influenced by anthropogenic warming [10,
p. 42].
1.2 E NSEMBLE FORECASTS BY THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR MEDIUM -RANGE WEATHER
FORECASTS (ECMWF)
The atmospheric weather system is famously a chaotic system, which means even though we can
derive deterministic physical laws governing its constituent parts (e.g. differential equations), if
we use these laws to predict the future development of the system, any small discrepancy in initial
conditions between two scenarios will keep growing until the two predictions appear completely
unrelated from each other. This is popularly known as the butterfly effect.
In weather forecasting, this discrepancy will always be present, not just because through our obser-
vations we obtain a limited understanding of the state of the atmosphere, but because we introduce
further discrepancies during the prediction (from an imperfect knowledge of the physical laws, or the
finite resolution of e.g. our numerical integration).
Ensemble weather forecasts are one way to address this challenge: instead of performing one
numerical integration and taking that to be our forecast, we perform many (an ensemble), each with
slight perturbations in the initial conditions or the equations used for the prediction, within a range
that can conceivably match our ignorance of the system. These forecasts can thus provide not just
predictions of the weather but also our uncertainty in any prediction, based on the variance between
the ensemble members.
ECMWF produces many forecasts, but crucially since 2015, twice a week, it has run an ENS Extended ,
a global 51-member ensemble forecast, integrated forward for 6 weeks (1104h)[11]. Since 2016,
it has run a companion product to ENS Extended, called a Reforecast orHindcast , where it used
*The dominant dataset, ERA5 [5] has been recently back-extended from 1979 to 1940 [7, 8].
2the same latest version of their physical model, but instead of initiating it on the current state of
the atmosphere, it used initial conditions from the same date but every year in the past 20 years
and integrated 11 ensembles in each. This practise allows ECMWF to compare those reforecast
predictions to the weather then recorded and consequently understand the strengths and weaknesses
of their current model and provide constraints on the active forecast [12].
1.3 M ACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS
Optimization On reason why power systems planners used representative years is due to the
computationally intensive nature of the Optimum Power Flow problem. Bypassing this computational
cost with machine learning algorithms is a hot topic of research, but these algorithms are often
trained on IEEE abstract test grids with synthetic data [13]. Small scale in-the-loop optimization
demonstrations such as Huang and Chen [14] show success but require 12500 synthetic training
samples and larger systems can be expected to require even more. Unlike ERA5, this dataset can
supply such breadth of data from the real world.
Diffusion In some of the latest climate simulation downscaling methods, a diffusion process capable
of generating novel samples is trained on high resolution weather scenarios, and then the new samples
generated are conditioned to match outputs of the coarse climate model [15]. Larger sample of
possible weather situations might allow to train much better and more expressive diffusion processes.
2 D ATA COLLECTION AND ARCHIVAL PROCESS
The dataset presented has been collected from previously run ECMWF numerical integrations.
Continually assimilating the latest observations, ECMWF reruns the full integration regularly and
provides easy access to this operational forecast to its member states and paying customers. After
the predictions are superseded by the next integration, all the previous outputs are, still kept, but
moved to an offline tape archive. This data is then governed by the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International (CC BY 4.0) license. To access the MARS Archive a license must have been acquired
from the Met Office (UK representative).
Reading anything from the tapes is subject to a queue of requests and therefore a slow process. Each
integration run is stored on a separate tape (reforecasts on multiple), so a single forecast request takes
4 hours to proceed (22 hours for multi-tape reforecast requests). Due to the maximum request size
limitation and concerns about the storage of the dataset, only a set of the most relevant variables
has been selected (Table 1), the spatial extent was cropped to a lon-lat rectangle (N/W/S/E = 72/-
12/33/34.8) covering the European grid and its surrounding areas. The data has been interpolated
from the native spectral representation on an octahedral grid to a uniform 0.4◦or0.5◦lat/lon grid. A
script created to continuously submit the requests and the requests used are available in appendix A.3.
3 E VALUATION AND COVERAGE
Ensemble independence The divergence required to ensure the weather samples are indeed
independent of their initial conditions, has been evaluated through variance between ensemble
members. In figure 2, it can be seen that past two weeks, the variance remains at its maximum value,
therefore there is 31 days or 4.5 weeks of essentially independent data.
Size of the dataset Since we can obtain 4.5 ×51 weeks of data from every forecast and 4.5 ×20×11
from every reforecast and they’ve been run twice a week, per year of the model runs we obtain 460
and 1960 years of data. This is fully available for the years 2016-2022 providing more than 14,000
years of data in total.
Extended distribution To illustrate the power of this dataset, figure 3 contains the comparison of a
small subset of ECMWF forecast runs to ERA5 scenarios. A single forecast contains a broader range
of scenarios that can occur in the wind power system than a full year of ERA5 scenarios.
3Figure 2: Variance between ensemble members relative to the maximum for each variable. The
seasonal signal in winter solar radiation doesn’t allow a direct comparison.
Figure 3: Histogram of difference between 100m wind speed averaged over the spatial extent of two
countries (Germany - United Kingdom, shown in the inset). Histograms from four different sources
of data are overlaid, all sampled 6 hourly: a full year of ERA5 reanalysis, a single (winter) 4-week
51-ensemble ENS forecast, an accumulation of ENS forecasts over the whole year, and accumulation
of Reforecasts over a whole year (which contain data corresponding to the 20 years prior). The y-axis
representing counts is scaled logarithmically, showing the much wider distribution present in the
ECMWF dataset.
Limitations For both the Extended forecast and the Reforecast, ECMWF only saves the state of
the numerical system 6 hourly. This means this dataset can’t be used directly to evaluate immediate
dynamic responses of the system, such as power ramping.
Future development Since June 2023, the ENS Extended is run daily with 100 members, increasing
the multiplicative factor to 3150 years/year once a whole year of forecasts is computed.
4 C ONCLUSION
The ever-growing threat of climate change demands innovative approaches to planning and assessing
future power, or any other weather-driven systems. This study underlines the limitations of using
past weather data for such endeavors and promotes the use of an extensive, varied weather scenario
bank, available through our dataset. This proposed methodology not only provides a comprehensive
picture of possible weather events—including the extreme outliers—but also paves the way for novel
machine learning applications and their scaling, that couldn’t have been imagined in the past.
