ABSTRACT
Our ability to capture and remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) at gigaton scale within
a decade or two depends on our ability to quickly identify new materials that are
high performing, selective over other gases with low energy demand and then fur-
ther develop them for large scale deployment. As a proven technology for gas sep-
aration in other industrial applications, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) come in
virtually unlimited number of crystal combinations in their highly porous lattice
and may offer the solution for CO 2capture from atmosphere or industrial point
sources. Although MOFs can have highly complex crystal structure, which can-
not be easily exploited in tabular data format in conventional ML methods or more
recent Deep Learning methods, Graph Neural Networks can easily be trained on
their representative crystallographic information Ô¨Åle (CIF) content. In this work,
we train GNNs to create an end-to-end workÔ¨Çow to screen large number of MOF
crystal structures directly from the data within the crystallographic information
Ô¨Åles for their CO 2working capacity or CO 2/N2selectivity under low-pressure
conditions. Our preliminary results show that a simple 2-layered Graph Convo-
lution Networks (GCN) can easily achieve R2score in the range of 0.87 to 0.89,
easily.
1 N EED FOR CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE
Carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) is expected to play an im-
portant role in the global campaign to limit global warming to 1.5C. However, to achieve this
ambitious goal, we need to deploy CO 2capture capabilities at gigaton capacity - approximately
150X increment by 2050 (Global CCS Institute, 2020).
Currently, CO 2capture using chemical solvents is the most mature technology that has been proven
to work at large-scale (Leung et al., 2014). However, these capture systems have large footprints and
the energy demand to operate the process is very high. Studies conducted by U.S. National Energy
Technology Laboratory (NETL) suggests that implementing aqueous amine-based CO2 capture can
reduce the energy efÔ¨Åciency of a coal-Ô¨Åred power plant by 20-30% (Oko et al., 2017). The use of
large amount of thermal energy for solvent regeneration accounts for 20-25% of the operating cost
despite deploying advanced solvents.
Solvent-based capture systems are also expensive to build due to the large footprint of the packed bed
towers used for CO 2absorption and desorption. As a result, new separation technologies using either
solid sorbents, membranes, or cryogenics are being developed (Abanades et al., 2015) to address the
need for new material development to improve the CO2 capture capacity, selectivity over other gases,
and to reduce the regeneration energy demand. Hence, there is urgency to develop energy-efÔ¨Åcient
and compact capture processes to allow widespread adoption of CCUS in the industrial sector and
reduce global warming.
2 M ETAL -ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOF) FOR CO2 C APTURE
A variety of solid sorbent-based materials are being investigated for their CO 2adsorption capacity,
CO 2selectivity, stability, and regeneration capacity to efÔ¨Åciently remove CO 2from point sources

(Dziejarski et al., 2023). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of highly porous
crystalline materials, have come across as promising candidates due to their exceedingly high CO 2
adsorption capacities that are inherently tunable through their unique structural features (Sumida et
al., 2012) (Li et al., 2022) and more importantly, their scalability for industrial applications. MOFs
are built through transition metal clusters and organic linkers into structural building units (SBUs)
that are further extended into well-deÔ¨Åned, uniformed structures with high surface area and struc-
tural stability. Those highly tunable SBUs in MOFs offer exceptional adaptability in isoreticular
manipulation as well as their controllable functionalities in CO 2adsorption through their theoreti-
cal, inÔ¨Ånite combinations among metal ions, organic linkers, functional group, and optimization of
pores spacing (Lu et al., 2022)
For post-combustion CO 2capture processes, there is an urgent need to understand the role of impu-
rities, water in particular, the variability in the concentrations of impurities in the feed stream and
more importantly, their impact on the stability of the sorbents as well as the energy requirement
for the regeneration processes. However, to-date, only a small number of MOFs have been studied
experimentally to meet target-speciÔ¨Åc requirements, which warrants the necessity for a faster and
reliable way to design and screen MOFs for post-combustion capture processes.
Past ML work on MOFs screening was driven by the subject matter experts (SME) time-consuming
analysis of the properties through feature engineering with geometric, chemical, and energy-based
descriptors. Graph Neural Network, on the other hand, can be used to represent complex crystal
structures of MOF using their crystallographic information, including but not limited to their unit
cell values, space groups, identities, and position of the atoms, as well as properties of each bond.
3 P ROPOSED GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (GNN) M ETHOD
Various types of data in many aspects of our lives can be represented by graphs and there are solu-
tions already implemented using Graph Neural Networks Scarselli et al. (2009). Recommender
systems in online shopping sites (Wu et al., 2022), trafÔ¨Åc prediction in mobile phone applica-
tions (Derrow-Pinion et al., 2021), weather forecasting (Lam et al., 2023) and our beloved social-
networks, all use different types of GNNs in their core. GNNs are also utilized in science for
physics simulations (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020), molecule classiÔ¨Åcation (Sanchez-Lengeling et
al., 2019) or molecule design (Liu et al., 2018), drug discovery (You et al., 2018), protein discovery
(Knutson et al., 2022) and many other tasks.
Our proposed method utilizes the CIF Ô¨Åle content and encode it in graph representation to train
GNN models to predict material performance as illustrated in Figure 1. Material performances
were computed through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method (Lu et al., 2022). Unlike
simple molecules, a single MOF crystal can make up to a thousand of bonds, which brings a chal-
lenge for any ML method to handle such nonuniform dataset. In our preliminary results, we have
demonstrated GCNs coded in PyG can easily handle the training of such complex data structures
as undirected graphs in a regression problem of predicting MOF properties such as the CO 2work-
ing capacity or selectivity. As expected from the problem deÔ¨Ånition, i.e., screening large number
of potential candidates, most of the MOF crystals are low performing. This can be seen by the
label distribution for working capacity and selectivity in Figure 2. This creates a challenge as the
predicted data is skewed for this regression task.
4 P RELIMINARY RESULTS ON GNN-B ASED SCREENING OF MOF S
In this work, we implemented and trained end-to-end GNN models directly from the existing CIF
content via PyG and used the corresponding GCMC data to predict their CO 2working capacity or
CO 2/N2selectivity as depicted in Figure 1 (Fey et al., 2019). We utilized the CIF Ô¨Åles for 340,000
MOFs where over 250,000 of the Ô¨Åles were missing their bond distances. Using the unit cell dimen-
sions and atom site fractional coordinates, we calculated the bond distances to use them as one of
the node features. Along with the bond distances, one-hot encoded bond types constitute the edge
attributes for each MOF. Adjacency matrix which represents which atoms are connected through
bonds (i.e., graph edges) was encoded as edge lists. Node attributes include the atomic weight of
each atom and one-hot encoded atom types. Crystal unit cell dimensions and angles are also utilized
along with the one-hot encoded crystal type information as shown on the left in Figure 3. Exploiting

the information provided in each CIF Ô¨Åles, one can eliminate the need for hand-picked geometric or
chemical descriptors and reduce the SMEs workload. Initially, we focused on training GCN models
(Coley et al., 2018) and achieved R2score ranging 0.87 to 0.89, easily. A sample test result is shown
on the right side of Figure 3. In comparison to our preliminary results, prior ML work using only
SME-designed geometric descriptors alone reached R2score up to 0.75 (Burner, 2020), whereas
custom designed atomic property-weighted radial distribution function (AP-RDF) features can push
the ML model R2score to a range of 0.83 and 0.94, respectively. Similarly, it was shown that CNN
based end-to-end screening can achieve R2score up to 0.91 (Lu et al., 2022).
In our preliminary results shown above, we explored Graph Convolution Networks (Raschka et al.,
2022) (Labonne et al., 2023) and achieved good R2score results with simple two-layered convolu-
tion architecture utilizing the information coming directly from the CIFs. In the follow-up work, we
aim to explore graph attention networks (Velickovic et al., 2017) as comparative study to identify
most efÔ¨Åcient GNN architectures for the screening task. In addition, implementation of a custom
cost functions with weighting based on the density for the regression may help with the performance
(Steininger et al., 2021) beyond simple MSE cost function that we have used for GCN training.
