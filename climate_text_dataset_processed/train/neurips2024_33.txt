Abstract
The escalated demand for hyperscale data centers due to generative AI has intensi-
fied the operational load, leading to increased energy consumption, water usage,
and carbon emissions. In this paper, we propose EquiShift , a novel equitable
spatial-temporal workload balancing algorithm that shifts workloads spatially and
temporarily across geographically different data centers to minimize the overall
energy costs while ensuring fair distribution of water and carbon footprints. Con-
cretely, EquiShift introduces a model predictive control (MPC) framework to
solve the equitable load balancing problem, leveraging the predictive capabilities
of MPC to optimize load distribution in real-time. Finally, we present compara-
tive evaluations against state-of-the-art load-balancing algorithms to demonstrate
the performance of EquiShift which underscores the potential of equitable load
balancing as a key strategy for enhancing the sustainability of data centers while
achieving fairness in the face of growing computational demands.
1 Introduction
The rapid digitization and growth of generative AI have significantly increased demands on data
centers, leading to heightened energy consumption. In 2022, data centers consumed approximately
460 TWh, accounting for around 2%of the global total electricity usage [1]. This large-scale energy
consumption contributes to a significant portion of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [2].
Additionally, training large language models such as GPT-3 in data centers can directly evaporate
700,000liters of freshwater, let alone the additional water usage for inference to serve millions of
user requests [3].
To mitigate the environmental impact, industries have implemented various measures, including
the adoption of green infrastructure such as wide-scale renewable energy, climate-aware cooling,
hardware reuse, geographical workload balancing, and carbon-aware computing [4 –11]. However,
these solutions often lead to disproportionate benefits, causing certain regions to bear a heavier
environmental burden due to an uneven distribution of computational loads. For example, a Google
data center in Finland benefits from 23 times more green energy (and less fossil-fuel air pollution)
compared to a facility in Singapore [12, 13], creating a regional disparity in carbon emissions.
Similarly, Nordic countries exhibit better water efficiency (<1.0 L/kWh) compared to hotter regions
(9.0 L/kWh), making water consumption in areas like Arizona disproportionately high [14].
Additionally, existing load shifting techniques such as geographical load balancing (GLB, which
shifts workloads across different data centers) create unintentional disparities since their focus on
minimizing the total energy consumption and carbon emissions can inadvertently increase water
footprints putting severe stresses on limited freshwater resources and further exacerbate the uneven
distribution of water usage. To address these regional disparities in environmental impact, an
equitable GLB approach offers a promising solution. By prioritizing areas with greater environmental
disadvantages and providing flexibility in spatial and temporal workload scheduling, this approach
can help ensure a more balanced distribution of environmental burdens.
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Some recent studies [14] have also tackled equitable GLB using a dual mirror descent approach, but
they only consider delay-sensitive AI inference workloads without exploiting deferrable workloads
(e.g., AI model training and back-end processing). In contrast, our algorithm EquiShift leverages
the spatial-temporal scheduling flexibility of data center workloads and employs Model Predictive
Control ( MPC ) [15], enabling dynamic and adaptable workload shifting in an equitable manner.
2 Problem Formulation
We model delay-tolerant energy-intensive workloads, such as ML training tasks, that can be flexibly
distributed among Ngeographically dispersed data centers connected via a common network. These
workloads are suitable for deferral because they are not often time-sensitive, allowing them to be
rerouted to data centers that are less environmentally impacted in a dynamic manner. Each data center
i∈[1, N]receives a portion yi(t)of the total incoming workload λ(t)at time t∈[1, T], where Tis
the time horizon. The associated energy cost, water usage, and carbon emissions at each data center
are denoted by fi(yi(t)),wi(yi(t)), and ci(yi(t)), respectively, and are also time-varying functions
for which we omit the time index for brevity.
EquiShift minimizes the total energy cost while also reducing the maximum water and carbon
footprints among the data centers (i.e., minimax). By prioritizing the regions most affected by water
usage and carbon emissions, EquiShift ensures an equitable and sustainable distribution of these
impacts over the entire time horizon T.

In Eqn. (1),κwandκcare positive constants representing the relative importance of minimizing water
and carbon footprints, respectively. The constraint in Eqn. (1b) limits the total distributed workload
by the available workload at any time t∈[1, T], plus any left-over workload from the previous time
stept−1. The constraint in Eqn. (1c) ensures that the total workload distributed across all data
centers matches the total incoming workload by the end of the time horizon T. Additionally, Eqn. (1d)
ensures that no data center is overloaded beyond its capacity Mi. Details on the computation of
energy, water, and carbon footprints are provided in Appendix A.
3EquiShift : Equity-Aware Spatial-Temporal Workload Shifting using MPC
The formulation in (1)assumes complete knowledge of future contexts (i.e., an offline method) such
as workloads, prices of electricity, water, and carbon efficiencies over the entire time horizon T.
Therefore, it is ill-suited for the dynamic reality of data center operations. In response, we adopt
a model predictive control (MPC) [15] approach to solve our equitable load balancing problem ,
which has also been implemented in real production-systems for sustainability without addressing
equity [16]. Formally, for a prediction horizon K(length of the forecast future context), the following
objective function can be formulated for the MPC approach.

2In Eqn. (2a), the accumulated cost up to time t−1represents the historical cost, serving as a
penalizing factor in the optimization. This penalization influences the current workload distribution
to avoid further increases in energy costs, water usage, and carbon footprints. The MPC optimization
adheres to the constraints defined in Eqns. (1b) and(1d), along with the additional constraint in
Eqn. (2c). The latter constraint imposes a limit on the total distributed workload across the Ndata
centers over the predicted horizon K, ensuring it does not exceed the sum of the predicted incoming
workload and the residual workload from previous time steps ( δ(t−1)).
MPC iteratively solves this optimization problem, refining its decisions based on feedback from
past performance. Although the MPC solution typically deviates from the offline solution defined
in Eqn. (1)due to incomplete context information and prediction errors, it has the advantage of
continuous adjustment and offers good robustness in practice. By dynamically incorporating evolving
contextual information, such as electricity prices, water efficiency, and carbon efficiency, the MPC
solution often remains close to the optimal offline solution.
4 Setup
We simulate a network of N= 10 geographically distributed data centers with homogeneous capacity,
interconnected through a single gateway, located in the United States (Virginia, Georgia, Texas,
and Nevada), Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark), and Asia (Singapore
and Japan). To model the workload, we use GPU power usage data used in [14] over 18 days
from September 23rd to October 11th, 2022 which is later augmented to match the demand of 10
datacenters. Although this data is from the inference phase, we will also test other workload traces
over a multi-month length and defer the results to Appendix C. Electricity price data for this period is
sourced from [17] and [18], with country-level data for Europe and Asia, and state-level data for the
U.S. We compute hourly water efficiency for each region following the methodologies in [19] and [8],
using hourly fuel mix data from [18], while carbon efficiency data is obtained from [20] (more details
in Appendix B). Our EquiShift approach is compared in terms of cost savings and equity against
six representative algorithms: (1) Energy and Water GLB [21] ( EWShift ) minimizes total energy
cost and water footprint, (2) Energy and Carbon GLB ( ECShift ) [8] minimizes total energy cost
and carbon footprint, (3) Energy GLB ( EnShift ) minimizing total energy costs [9 –11], (4) Water
GLB ( WaShift ) minimizes the total water footprint, (5) Carbon GLB ( CaShift ) minimizes the total
carbon footprint, and (6) Total GLB ( ToShift ) [22] jointly minimizes the total energy cost, water
footprint, and carbon footprint. We compute the cost savings of our equitable algorithm compared to
other algorithms based on η=CEq−COt
COt·100% , where CEq,COtdenote the cost for equitable and
other algorithms respectively and ηindicates the percent of cost savings over the other algorithms.
In addition, we use Jain’s fairness index [23] as equity metric for each algorithm that utilizes the
coefficient of variance ν=σ
µ, where µis the average regional environmental footprint and σis the
standard deviation. The following equation is used to compute the Jain’s Index ζ=1
1+ν2, where νis
the coefficient of variance.
5 Result
We compare the cost savings of the EquiShift approach against other GLBs, using κw= 60$ /m3
andκc= 1500$ /Tonassuming no prediction error. We also highlight the deviation of the EquiShift
from the EquiShift-Offline approach. EquiShift algorithm’s primary objective is to reduce
regional disparities in water and carbon footprints. To demonstrate the comprehensive efficiency
of our solution, we focus our comparisons on average energy cost, maximum regional water, and
carbon footprints. While these metrics highlight our approach’s effectiveness in addressing extreme
cases, we also provide average case water and carbon footprint analysis for a more comprehensive
understanding. Further results, including the effects of varying κwandκc, prediction errors, and
prediction windows, are provided in Appendix B due to space constraints.
Table 1 illustrates the cost savings achieved by EquiShift compared to other GLBs. In most
cases, EquiShift results in reduced costs and footprints, therefore we focus on the scenarios
where cost increases are observed. Specifically, EquiShift shows a 6.01%, 6.20%, 21.82%, and
10.38% increase in energy cost compared to the EWShift ,ECShift ,EnShift , and ToShift methods,
respectively. This increase is justified by substantial reductions in the worst-case water and carbon

footprints across regions. Moreover, EquiShift exhibits a 16.21% and 3.85% rise in energy and
total cost, respectively, compared to the EquiShift-Offline algorithms. However, EquiShift
also achieves a 6% reduction in the worst-case water footprint and a 7% reduction in the worst-case
carbon footprint compared to EquiShift-Offline . These deviations are primarily due to contextual
differences, as the MPC approach does not have access to complete information, unlike the offline
method. Additionally, while the average water and carbon footprints for EquiShift show slight
increases in some cases compared to the state-of-the-art methods, these changes are justifiable given
the significant improvements in addressing regional disparities in water and carbon footprints. In
conclusion, the EquiShift algorithm offers significant reductions in water and carbon footprints,
with a modest increase in energy cost, and provides the flexibility to adjust preferences based on
specific goals.

Fig 1a and Fig 1b illustrate the fairness of the EquiShift compared to other load-balancing methods,
using Jain’s fairness index [23]. The results show that the EquiShift algorithm consistently achieves
the highest fairness scores for both water and carbon footprints. This indicates that our method is more
effective at reducing regional disparities across geographically distributed data centers, promoting
more sustainable and equitable data center operations. However, the equity controlled by κwand
κcimpacts the energy consumption and thus requires careful selection to achieve the operational
sustainability goal.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose EquiShift to address a critical issue in existing sustainable load-shifting
methods: the lack of awareness of regional disparities in environmental sustainability. Moreover,
EquiShift offers greater adaptability by exploiting both spatial and temporal scheduling flexibilities.
However, achieving true sustainability in data center operation may require considering factors
beyond carbon emissions and water usage, such as local ecological impacts, energy source variability,
socio-economic conditions, etc. Future work should aim to incorporate these factors, ensuring a
holistic view that aligns operational efficiency with long-term environmental and societal goals in an
equitable manner.

6A Quantifying Energy Cost and Environmental Impact
In the main experiment, we used fi(yi(t),wi(yi(t)andci(yi(t)as the energy cost, water, and carbon
footprint respectively for data center iat time t∈[1, T]. Here we present the details of computing
each of the cost and footprints for the distributed workload yi(t).
Energy Cost: Energy cost is a fundamental metric for assessing the operational efficiency and
sustainability of data centers, as it is directly tied to electricity consumption. Understanding and
managing this cost is crucial for optimizing data center operations. Drawing from established
research [24 –26], we model the electricity consumption of a data center as a function of the workload
it handles and its server utilization, which in turn depends on the number of active servers.
In a typical data center, not all servers are active simultaneously; however, each server still consumes
a baseline level of energy, known as static power ( ei,s), even when idle. Beyond this, processing the
incoming workload demands additional energy, referred to as dynamic power ( ei,d). The combined
energy consumption of the data center is thus influenced by both these components and can be
expressed by the following equation:
ei(yi(t)) =γi(t)·Mi(t)
ei,s+ei,d·yi(t)
Mi(t)
(3)
In Eqn. (3),yi(t)represents the workload dispatched to data center i, while Mi(t)denotes the number
of active servers. The static power ( ei,s) accounts for the baseline energy consumption, and dynamic
power ( ei,d) scales with server utilization, represented byyi(t)
Mi(t). The factor γi(t)captures the Power
Usage Effectiveness (PUE), reflecting the efficiency of the data center in utilizing its electrical energy.
To translate energy consumption into a monetary cost, we define the power cost function ( fi(yi(t))),
which incorporates the price of electricity ( pi(t)) at data center iduring time t:
fi(yi(t)) =pi(t)·ei(yi(t)) (4)
In Eqn. (4), the electricity price pi(t)can vary significantly depending on the regional energy mix,
including the availability of fossil fuels (such as coal and gas) and renewable energy sources. This
variability highlights the importance of strategic workload distribution and timing, as these factors
can greatly influence the overall energy cost. This energy cost model provides a comprehensive view
covering both static and dynamic energy consumption of a data center.
Water Footprint: The operation of data centers involves substantial water consumption, primarily
for cooling purposes, to maintain optimal operating conditions and mitigate the risks associated with
overheating. Cooling towers, which are widely used in data centers, rely heavily on water-based
cooling systems due to their efficiency compared to air cooling, especially in regions with high
ambient temperatures where air cooling may be insufficient. However, the process of cooling leads to
water evaporation, contributing to water loss and increasing the overall water footprint of the data
center.
In quantifying the water footprint, it is crucial to consider both direct and indirect water usage. Direct
water usage refers to the water consumed onsite for cooling and other operational processes within
the data center. Indirect water usage, on the other hand, pertains to the water consumed offsite in the
production of electricity that powers the data center. Previous research, such as [3] and [24], have
explored these aspects extensively, offering methodologies for calculating the total water footprint by
integrating both direct and indirect contributions. This comprehensive approach can be expressed by
the following equation:
wi(yi(t)) =ϵi,D(t)
γi(t)+ϵi,I(t)
·ei(yi(t)) (5)
In Eqn. (5),ϵi,D(t)represents the direct Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), which is a measure of
how efficiently water is used onsite for cooling purposes. This includes factors such as the design of
the cooling system, the ambient temperature, and the efficiency of water recycling processes within
7the data center [3]. The term γi(t)denotes the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), a metric that
reflects the overall energy efficiency of the data center, impacting the direct water usage due to its
influence on the amount of heat generated.
The second term, ϵi,I(t), is the indirect Water Usage Effectiveness, also known as the Electricity
Water Intensity Factor (EWIF). This factor accounts for the water used in the generation of electricity
consumed by the data center. Since the energy mix varies by region, with different proportions
of fossil fuels, hydroelectric power, and other renewable sources, the indirect water usage can
vary significantly. For example, regions reliant on thermal power plants, particularly those using
water-intensive cooling methods, may have a higher EWIF, thereby increasing the overall water
footprint.
By combining these factors, the equation wi(yi(t))provides a comprehensive measure of the water
footprint associated with the data center’s operations, encompassing both the onsite and offsite water
consumption.
Carbon Footprint: The carbon footprint [27] of a data center is a critical metric that quantifies
the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted as a result of the energy
consumed by the data center. This metric provides insights into how efficiently the data center utilizes
energy and serves as a key indicator of its environmental impact. Understanding the carbon footprint
is essential for informed decision-making aimed at reducing emissions and promoting sustainability
within the data center industry. The carbon footprint can be computed using the following equation:
ci(yi(t)) = Γ i(t)·ei(yi(t)) (6)
In Eqn. (6),Γi(t)represents the Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) for the ithdata center at time t.
The CUE is a pivotal metric that defines the ratio of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
with the data center’s operations to the total energy consumed by its IT equipment. Essentially, a
lower CUE value indicates a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly data center, as it
implies that less carbon is emitted per unit of energy consumed.
The CUE is influenced by various factors, including the energy mix used by the data center. For
example, a data center powered primarily by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar,
will have a lower CUE compared to one that relies heavily on fossil fuels like coal or natural gas.
Additionally, advancements in energy efficiency technologies, such as more efficient cooling systems
or optimized server utilization, can further reduce the CUE.
B Additional Experimental Details
B.1 Data Preperation
In this section, we describe the underlying pre-processing conducted for the experiment, as we do not
have access to hourly energy fuel mix information for non-U.S. data center locations. Consequently,
we utilize U.S.-based hourly energy fuel mix data to generate synthetic hourly fuel mixes for
European and Asian locations. This synthesis is based on adhering to the average percentage of fuel
mix information within the time range of September 23 and October 11, 2022, as reported by [17].
To match the average energy fuel mix of European and Asian countries, we scale the U.S. data by the
factors provided in Table 2.
Different 18-day periods are intentionally selected to ensure that the data from U.S. locations does
not correlate with the European and Asian energy fuel mix data.
B.2 Impact of Weight Parameters
The weight parameters κwandκcare crucial in shaping the regional balance of water and carbon
footprints. Adjusting these parameters alters the focus on either water or carbon footprints, which in
turn affects the prioritization of energy costs. Fig. 2 illustrates how varying κwandκcimpacts energy
costs, water footprints, and carbon footprints for ou EquiShift , as well as for EWShift ,ECShift ,
andToShift . Other GLBs are not included in this analysis since they remain unaffected by these
weight parameters.
8Table 2: Scaling factors applied to U.S. energy fuel mix data to align with the average energy fuel
mix of European and Asian countries.
Country Source (U.S. State) Time Period Scaling Factor
Germany Texas June 1 – June 19, 2022 0.8503
Belgium Georgia June 1 – June 19, 2022 1.5319
Netherlands Georgia March 1 – March 19, 2022 1.2759
Denmark Oregon July 1 – July 19, 2022 0.2657
Japan Nevada March 1 – March 19, 2022 3.2374
Singapore Georgia May 1 – May 19, 2022 4.4875
In Fig. 2(a), we observe that increasing κwandκcshifts the focus from minimizing energy costs to
prioritizing water and carbon footprints, resulting in higher energy costs. Conversely, Figs. 2(b) and
2(d) show that with our EquiShift approach, raising these parameters effectively reduces water and
carbon footprints, as intended. This trend may not be apparent in other algorithms, which primarily
focus on minimizing overall costs or footprints.
Figure 2: Impact of the weighting parameters κwandκcon the environmental footprint and energy
cost in EquiShift .
To further analyze the impact, Figs. 2(c) and 2(e) present the ratio of maximum to mean footprint for
water and carbon, respectively. These figures demonstrate that as the weight parameters increase,
EquiShift achieves a more equitable distribution of footprints, with the max/mean ratio approaching
1, indicating fairness across regions. However, this increased equity in environmental footprints
comes at the cost of significantly higher energy expenditure, highlighting the need to balance fairness
with energy efficiency. In contrast, other GLBs may also experience higher energy costs, but they do
not achieve equitable distribution of footprints, leading to regional disparities.
B.3 Impact of Prediction Error and Window Length
Fig 3 illustrates how prediction error and prediction window length influence energy costs and
environmental footprints in data centers using our proposed MPC-based algorithm, EquiShift . The
heat maps display the relationship across three metrics: (a) energy cost, (b) water footprint, and (c)
carbon footprint.
In Fig 3(a), we see that higher prediction errors ( 0.8) combined with shorter prediction windows
(2) lead to increased energy costs. However, under the same conditions, Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) show
that both the water and carbon footprints are reduced. This reciprocal relationship indicates that
while energy costs decrease with improved prediction accuracy and longer prediction windows, the
environmental footprints tend to increase.
Importantly, these changes in energy costs and environmental footprints are not drastic. The strength
of the MPC-based algorithm lies in its ability to adapt smoothly to varying conditions. Even when
dealing with high prediction errors and short prediction windows, the algorithm can adjust load
distribution to stay near an optimal trajectory. This adaptability stems from its use of historical data
in decision-making. For instance, if a past decision results in a suboptimal load distribution, the
algorithm compensates in subsequent steps.

different prediction window lengths and prediction error magnitudes.
As a result, Fig. 3 demonstrates that the MPC-based approach maintains stability and remains close to
the optimal solution, even under challenging conditions of high prediction errors and short prediction
windows.
C Extended Experiments
C.1 Workload & Data Preparation
For the extended experiment, we use a machine learning workload trace from July and August 2020,
as detailed in [28]. This trace, collected from a production cluster with 6,742 GPUs in Alibaba’s
Platform for Artificial Intelligence (PAI) [29], includes a mixture of training and inference jobs
submitted by over 1,300 users. The workloads span a wide range of ML algorithms executed on
heterogeneous GPUs. Additional details are available in [28]. For our study, we process and scale the
original trace to fit the 10 locations described in Section 4.
As in the main experiment, we use U.S. fuel mix data for various locations and apply scaling factors
to align the fuel mix with the average compositions reported for Europe and Asia during the same
period by [17]. The scaling factors are summarized in Table 3.

C.2 Extended Results
Similar to the main experiment here we present the cost-saving and equity-based comparative analysis
ofEquiShift , with κw= 15 $/m3andκc= 100 $/Ton.
Table 4 shows that EquiShift generally achieves a reduction in cost/footprints over other GLBs.
However, EquiShift shows 16.91%,16.91%,18.40%,17.38% increase in energy cost compared to
EWShift ,ECShift ,EnShift , and ToShift . This rise is compensated by significant reductions in water
usage and carbon emissions, consistent with the findings from the main experiment. Additionally,
as in the main experiment, the average-case analysis reveals a slight increase in water and carbon
footprints for EquiShift compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, though the trade-offs are justifiable
in light of the improvements in regional equity.
An important observation from the extended experiment with EquiShift is the increase in energy
cost, water usage, and carbon footprint compared to EquiShift-Offline , whereas in the main
experiment, EquiShift achieved reductions in water and carbon footprints. This highlights the

load balancing ( EquiShift ) algorithm over other algorithms and EquiShift-Offline for extended
experiment.

critical trade-off between energy costs and environmental impacts. The main experiment shows a
sharper increase in energy cost compared to the extended experiment, which limits its ability to
reduce water and carbon footprints. This underscores the importance of tuning κwandκcin the
optimization process to balance these objectives effectively.
As demonstrated earlier, the weighting parameters κwandκcplay a crucial role in managing
disparities in water and carbon footprints. Prioritizing greater equity can lead to higher energy costs.
However, seeking greater equity may not always be the best approach for operational efficiency for
data centers, so a careful balance is required to manage these trade-offs.

We also compare the equity of EquiShift against other GLBs in Figs. 4a (for water) and 4b
(for carbon) for this extended experiment. According to Jain’s fairness index, [23], our proposed
EquiShift achieves a higher score than any other GLBs. This consistency with the main experiment
further underscores the advantages of EquiShift in promoting sustainable data center operations.
