Abstract
The ongoing transformation of climate and biodiversity will have a drastic impact
on almost all forms of life in the ocean with further consequences on food security,
ecosystem services in coastal and inland communities. Despite these impacts,
scientiﬁc data and infrastructures are still lacking to understand and quantify the
consequences of these perturbations on the marine ecosystem.
Understanding this phenomenon is not only an urgent but also a scientiﬁcally de-
manding task. Consequently, it is a problem that must be addressed with a scien-
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.tiﬁc cohort approach, where multi-disciplinary teams collaborate to bring the best
of different scientiﬁc areas.
In this proposal paper, we describe our newly launched four-years project focused
on developing new artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, and mathematical
modeling tools to contribute to the understanding of the structure, functioning,
and underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the global ocean symbiome and its
relation with climate change. These actions should enable the understanding of
our oceans and predict and mitigate the consequences of climate and biodiversity
changes.
1 Introduction
Considering the importance and amount of oceans in this speck of dust in the middle of nowhere
that we inhabit, we should have called it Planet Ocean. Oceans are not only important because
of their volume but are also about the functions and contributions they provide to biodiversity, we
included [ 1]. Oceans play a key role in the biosphere, regulating the carbon cycle; absorbing emitted
CO 2through the biological pump, and a large part of the heat that the remaining CO 2and other
greenhouse gases retained in the atmosphere.
The biological pump is driven by photosynthetic microalgae, herbivores, and decomposing bacteria.
Whales also play a prominent role by moving nutrients and providing mixing in the ocean [ 2–4].
Understanding the drivers of micro and macroorganisms in the ocean is of paramount importance to
understand the functioning of ecosystems and the efﬁciency of the biological pump in sequestering
carbon and thus abating climate change.
This situation poses a substantial challenge to humanity as a whole. It is not only an urgent but also a
scientiﬁcally demanding task. Consequently, it is a problem that must be addressed with a scientiﬁc
cohort approach, where multi-disciplinary teams must collaborate to bring the best of different sci-
entiﬁc areas: state-of-the-art artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, applied math, modeling, and
simulation, and, of course, marine biology and oceanography. They will enable us to understand our
oceans and to predict and —hopefully— mitigate the consequences of climate change.
Data is essential in this pursuit. Tara Océans1has spearheaded the methodological sampling of the
different phenomena that are taking place in our oceans. Despite these efforts, scientiﬁc data -even
with the import contribution from Tara and infrastructures is not sufﬁcient to adequately understand
and quantify the consequence of these perturbations on the marine ecosystem. In particular, critical
ecosystems need extensive surveys to characterize the biological acclimation to climate perturba-
tions better.
Consequently, it is necessary to not only gather more data but also to develop and apply state-of-
the-art mechanisms capable of turning this data into effective knowledge, policies, and action. This
is where artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and modeling tools are called for. The
application of these methods in the context of ecology and climate change is not new [ 5]. However,
the inherent complexity of this problem poses important challenges to modern computer science and
applied mathematics.
2 Context and domain challenges
Despite the growth of research applying AI and ML to problems of societal and global good, there
remains the need for a concerted effort to identify how these tools may best be applied to tackle
climate change. On the other hand, many computer scientists and practitioners wish to act but
are uncertain how. Similarly, many ﬁeld experts have begun actively seeking input from the AI,
ML, and modeling communities. To structure the goals of the project around the following domain
challenges:
•Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning [ 6]. Biodiversity supports important functions,
such as primary productivity and carbon ﬁxation and sequestration, that are directly or
indirectly used and affected by humans.

Figure 1: Relation between the AI/ML and modeling approaches with respect to the domain ques-
tions.
•Meta-metabolic modeling . The objective is to develop a metabolic model including the
main microbial oceanic compartments, and couple it with physics. A meta-metabolic model
is challenging due to the variety in the pathways and time scales.
•Phytoplankton biodiversity with regard to temperature [ 7]. The main purpose is to
create models to properly incorporate plankton complexity into ocean-climate models, as-
suming the stochastic nature of this system.
•Data assimilation in biogeochemical models: Predicting the future . Data assimila-
tion strategies should be developed to calibrate biogeochemical models using the available
database. AI tools combined with applied mathematics can allow reaching prediction capa-
bility.
•Computer vision for understanding plankton communities . Tara Océans has obtained
from the samples being extracted as a camera is submerged to grab images of the micro-
scopic organisms found. Some tasks to be address include:
–Plankton identiﬁcation from satellite images : integrate omics information with high-
throughput/high-resolution plankton imaging and environmental data crossed with
satellite images.
–Connecting images and genomic features : establish the connection between plankton
images and genomic data could state biogeography of the morphological diversity, and
identify genes responsible for plankton shapes and morphologies.
–Explainable anomaly detection for automatic plankton discovery : will require ex-
tended use of causal inference and image-based explainable AI methods should hint
what parts of the observed organism that determining its identiﬁcation.
3 Addressing the Goals with a Multi-Disciplinary Approach
AI, ML, and modeling tools are key to understanding oceans and climate change. However, their
current limitations pose important hurdles in their application. In the case of ML, only recently
it has started to be able to handle structured information, like the one required to understand the
networks created by interacting populations of different species. Despite the important efforts on
data gathering, the current amount of data available conform to a scenario that can be denominated
as small data, that heavily contrasts with the data-hungry methods that conform most of the current
state of the art in ML. This situation could be overcome either by improving the modeling methods
themselves or by taking a stab at developing mechanistic approaches that also seem to be capable of
complementing AI and ML in the application domain [ 8].
The above domain challenges are to be addressed in a multidisciplinary fashion that integrates com-
puter science and applied mathematics. We have identiﬁed a group of computer science topics that
should be addressed, in particular:
•Structured and graph-based neural networks [ 9–12].The most frequent way to rep-
resent biodiversity today is through co-occurrence graphs. These graphs have particular
3structures that deserve to be analyzed using the presented techniques and their improve-
ments. A comparison of such graphs is a way to observe the evolution of communities. So
having ML methods capable to function on top of this information is essential to understand
such dynamics.
•Learning and adaptation . This topic comprehends active/few-shot/multi-task learning,
transfer learning (TL), and domain adaptation. In problems with limited data and high
uncertainty, like the ones to be dealt with here, it is necessary to apply methods that direct
the measurements to the areas of the domain where they are most necessary using active
learning or Bayesian principles. Here, few-shot learning methods (relying on TL) must
take care of producing actionable products with minimal data.
•Causality [ 13] and explainable AI [ 14].This is a core concern in computer science at the
moment. It is also an essential component of the challenge as we intend to use the models
created to serve as a means for understanding nature and as sources for new theories.
•Model-driven and data-driven integration and hybrids. Biogeophysical models [ 15]
can be very time and CPU time consuming. The idea here is to use deep learning ap-
proaches to reproduce the predictions of these resource-demanding models. More precisely,
to reduce complex models using deep neural networks. We plan to investigate schemes for
decomposing a process model into PDE and statistical components.
•Development, calibration, and validation of mechanistic models . The high dimension
of the biogeochemical models makes challenging their calibration and validation from a
reduced number of measurements.
In addition to the above directions, we plan to deploy an open-access data lake that rely on the M2B3
standard [ 16] containing or providing transparent access to a diverse set of data sources like Tara
Océans data, Copernicus, SeaDataNet, PANGAEA, etc. It will allow to cross-reference and geo-
reference data by providing homogeneous access to all sources and the capacity of merging with
other data sources.
We are conﬁdent that addressing the domain challenges in the next four years with the focus of
researchers of different institutions we will be able to make progress on our understanding of marine
biology. We expect to provide actionable decision-making tools that would enable to derive data-
informed conclusions and focus resources to deal with the ecological challenges ahead of us.

this section are already open to the public at PANGAEA (Data Citation 4).
[4] Properties of seawater and particulate & dissolved matter from discrete water samples
In addition to sensors mounted on the Rosette Vertical Sampling System [RVSS], seawater was collected
using Niskin bottles [NISKIN] (6 × 8-L Niskins and 4 × 12-L Niskins) in order to further characterise
environmental conditions in the ecosystem under study. Measurements include pigment concentrations
from HPLC analysis (10 depths per vertical pro /uniFB01le; 25 pigments per depth), the carbonate system
(Surface and 400 m; pHT, CO 2, pCO 2, fCO 2, HCO 3, CO 3, Total alkalinity, Total carbon,
OmegaAragonite, OmegaCalcite, and quality Flag), nutrients (10 depths per vertical pro /uniFB01le; NO 2, PO 4,
N02/NO 3, SI, quality Flags), DOC, CDOM, and dissolved oxygen isotopes. More than 200 vertical pro /uniFB01les
of these properties were made across the world ocean. DOC, CDOM and dissolved oxygen isotopes are
available only for the Arctic Ocean and Arctic Seas (2013 campaigns). Tara Oceans data corresponding to
methods described in this section are already open to the public at PANGAEA (Data Citation 5).
[5] Environmental features and sampling stations
During the Tara Oceans Expedition (2009 –2013), plankton were sampled from 5 –10-m thick layers in
the water column, corresponding to speci /uniFB01c environmental features that were characterised on-board
from sensor measurements. Environmental features are de /uniFB01ned by controlled vocabularies in the
environmental ontology (EnvO; http://environmentontology.org/)17.
The surface water layer (ENVO:00002042), sometimes labelled in the literature and databases as
“surface ”,“SRF”,“SUR”,“SURF ”or“S”, was simply de /uniFB01ned as a layer between 3 and 7 m below the sea
surface. The deep chlorophyll maximum layer (ENVO:01000326), often labelled in the literature and
databases as “DCM ”or“D”, was determined from the chlorophyll /uniFB02uorometer (WETLabs optical
sensors) mounted on the Rosette Vertical Sampling System [RVSS]. The presence of a DCM may indicate

A Context on Tara Expeditions Data
There is a clear scientiﬁc consensus about the effects of climate change on the global ocean: among
others a shift of temperatures, an increase of acidiﬁcation, deoxygenation of water masses, and per-
turbations in nutrient availability and biomass productivity. Altogether, these abiotic changes will
have a drastic impact on almost all forms of life in the ocean with further consequences on food
security, ecosystem services and the well-being of coastal communities. In this regard, Tara Océans
has spearheaded the actions directed towards sampling and understanding the different phenom-
ena that are taking place. Figure 2illustrate the complex sampling methodology applied. Despite
these numerous impacts, scientiﬁc data -even with the import contribution from Tara Océans and
infrastructures are not sufﬁcient to adequately understand and quantify the consequence of these
perturbations on the marine ecosystem. In particular, critical ecosystems need extensive surveys to
characterize the biological acclimation to climate perturbations better. Consequently, it is necessary
to not only gather more data but also to develop and apply state-of-the-art mechanisms capable of
turning this data into effective knowledge, policies and action. This is where artiﬁcial intelligence,
machine learning and modeling tools are called for.
The upcomming Tara expetion with cover the Patagonian region. This is a unique ecosystem that
represents an open sky laboratory for ecological studies. This pristine region is indeed changing
more rapidly under the effects of climate change and describes an oracle of changes to come in the
next decades for other parts of the ocean. Patagonia is fundamental to understand the responses of
the microbial marine life at the interface between antarctic waters, the coastal ecosystems, and the
melting glaciers. This region is also one of the most productive regions in the ocean, accounting
for more than 30% of sardines stocks, among other species and one of the most important region in
6sequestering carbon. Patagonia is also a hot spot of aquaculture, with an intensive salmon production,
an ecosystem that is both impacting, and being impacted by, climate changes. In order to understand
the functioning of this large scale ecosystem, the Tara Océans initiative has decided to carry out and
intense sampling campaign.
The consortium will build a modeling framework dedicated to ocean modeling, contributing to learn
causal and explanatory models; fair data models; and robust models. This project is an opportunity
to contribute key scientiﬁc knowledge on a global pressing problem as climate change is, capitalizing
on the experience and articulation of the teams involved and the availability of data on a key area, as
is the Patagonia, that can provide answers that can be transferred to others parts of the oceans.
The motivation of this interdisciplinary project is to develop new AI and mathematical model-
ing tools to contribute to the understanding of the structure, functioning, and underlying eco-
evolutionary mechanisms and dynamics of plankton in the global ocean. Methods like deep learning,
causal and inference learning, sequential decision making, transfer learning, multi-criteria optimiza-
tion are just a few that can be applied to these kinds of complex problems, allowing us to get reliable
knowledge from the ocean and its interactions. To do this, we will use the corpus of Tara Océans
Expeditions datasets, which is, as far as we know, the most comprehensive case study to develop AI
and mathematical modeling methods for studying global ecology along with other related datasets.
This fundamental baseline currently makes marine plankton the best-described planetary ecosystem
in terms of taxonomic composition, abundance, and genetic diversity, making this project realistic.
