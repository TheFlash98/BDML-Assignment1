Abstract
A low-carbon energy transition is transpiring to combat climate change, posing
an existential threat to oil and gas companies, particularly the Majors1. Though
Majors yield the resources and expertise to adapt to low-carbon business models,
meaningful climate-aligned strategies have yet to be enacted. A 2-degrees pathways
(2DP) wargame was developed to assess climate-compatible pathways for the oil
Majors. Recent advances in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have
achieved superhuman-level performance in solving high-dimensional continuous
control problems. Modeling within a Markovian framework, we present the novel
2DP-MARL model which applies deep MARL methods to solve the 2DP wargame
across a multitude of transition scenarios. Designed to best mimic Majors in real-
life competition, the model reveals all Majors quickly adapt to low-carbon business
models to remain robust amidst energy transition uncertainty. The purpose of this
work is provide tangible metrics to support the call for oil Majors to diversify into
low-carbon business models and, thus, accelerate the energy transition.
1 Introduction
An energy transition is manifesting in efforts to combat climate change and meet the goals set out by
the Paris Agreement. The Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) and Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) [ 8] exhibited a multitude of potential climate change mitigation
pathways in line with climate targets. Though pathways vary, all scenarios are predicated on low-
carbon energy sources supplying the majority of global energy consumption. Deep decarbonization,
however, has yet to be realized as fossil fuel growth persists, thus prolonging an energy transition.
Carney [ 3] urges the need for massive reallocation of capital toward low-carbon solutions and
McCollum [ 9] quantiÔ¨Åes the investment gaps needed to be Ô¨Ålled to achieve Paris. As individual
countries act to answer these calls and deliver a collective transition to a low-carbon economy, risks
will arise and companies may need to rapidly adapt. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial
Disclosures [ 15] highlighted such transition risks and their potential Ô¨Ånancial impacts. Evidently, the
risks inherent to a low-carbon energy transition pose an existential threat to the fossil fuel industry.
Since the 2014 oil price collapse, international oil companies (IOCs) have signiÔ¨Åcantly underper-
formed in contrast to economic growth realized in the same period, one of the many signs suggesting a
faltering business model [ 14,17]. A crucial Ô¨Ånancial recovery for IOCs becomes increasingly unlikely
as the impending energy transition unfolds. Though posing an existential threat to the industry, the
energy transition gives rise to signiÔ¨Åcant opportunities for such actors, particularly the oil and gas

high-cost reserves vulnerable to asset stranding and shareholder capital at risk of divestment [ 4,5] yet
offer the balance-sheets and project management expertise necessary to Ô¨Ånance and scale low-carbon
technologies that could largely Ô¨Åll the Paris-aligned investment gaps [ 7]. Central to this argument is
the question of when will the Majors begin to transition towards low-carbon business models. Despite
clear signals, the Majors have yet to make any signiÔ¨Åcant moves into low-carbon business models
which would prove resilient to carbon demand shocks and, thus, produce stable returns, drawing
concerns from investors and governments alike [6].
Literature regarding oil and gas companies in the energy transition echo the same sentiments: Majors
can and should adapt to a low-carbon world. However, besides outlining potential low-carbon
strategies, literature fails to provide tangible Ô¨Årst low-carbon mover risks and rewards. Quantifying
such outcomes may suggest an end to the Majors‚Äô capital reallocation waiting game by reducing
diversiÔ¨Åcation uncertainties. Founded on the shareholder primacy model of capitalism, the Majors
operate to maximize growth and returns to shareholders. This work aims to provide tangible insights
into the Majors‚Äô adaptive capacity to the energy transition by identifying Ô¨Årst low-carbon mover
potential outcomes in relation to such metrics and, thus, strategy pathways robust to transition
uncertainty. In efforts to achieve this, this work presents a novel deep MARL model utilized to solve
a continuous microeconomics wargame.
2 Solving a Wargame
The Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and E3G developed the 2DP wargaming tool to ‚Äúhelp
inform company, investor, government and civil society thinking around the pathways the oil and
gas majors can take to become 1.5C/2C-compatible‚Äù by simulating oil Majors in competition
within varying transition scenarios [ 2]. 2DP wargame participants role play as IOCs tasked to
responsibly allocate capital across oil, gas, and ‚Äògreen‚Äô markets in efforts to minimize asset stranding
while maximizing long-term market capitalization. Though the action space and objectives are
clear, the requirement of human players reveals more about human bias than the Majors‚Äô robust
strategy pathways and Ô¨Årst mover outcomes. Aware of this limitation, the authors proposed a future
2DP development to involve ‚Äúagent-based simulation to discover both optimal and scenario-robust
strategies.‚Äù This proposal prompts the purpose of this work going forward: to solve the 2DP wargame.
Game theoretic approaches solve strategic interactions between a set of agents. Applying such
methods to the 2DP wargame requires framing the long-term player relationships as an inÔ¨Ånitely-
repeated game. Conventional game theoretic algorithms, however, fail to effectively solve games with
no end, such as the 2DP wargame. Moreover, modeling the 2DP wargame‚Äôs high dimensional state
space and non-linear payoffs with game theory proves analytically and computationally intractable.
To overcome these barriers, developments in reinforcement learning are explored. The 2DP wargame
is a continuous control problem framed as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG)‚Äîa
Markovian framework resemblant of real-life market competition. Recent advances in deep MARL
[16, 1] have led to superhuman-level achievements in solving high-dimensional, continuous control
problems with multiple competing agents. In efforts to achieve this work‚Äôs aim, deep MARL methods
are applied to solve the 2DP wargame.
3 2DP-MARL
We present the 2DP-MARL model which utilizes deep MARL methods, including the application of
the Advantage Actor-Critic [ 11] and Proximal Policy Optimization [ 12] algorithms, to solve the 2DP
wargame under different 1.5C scenarios and, thus, provide insight from the Majors‚Äô emergent robust
strategy pathways in response to energy transition uncertainty. Appendix A details adjustments and
additions made to the 2DP wargame to enable the implementation of deep MARL and best mimic
real-life market competition. To the best of our knowledge, there is not yet a deep MARL model that
solves a microeconomics simulation relevant to the oil and gas energy transition discussion.
Initialized with real Ô¨Ånancial and industry data, agents compete as Majors within the 2DP wargame
environment under a given 1.5C scenario extracted from the IAMC/IIASA scenario ensemble.
Following the POSG framework, agents are granted incomplete observations of their environment and
opponents. The agents‚Äô available action set draws directly from the original 2DP wargame. Actions

include capital allocation across oil, gas, and ‚Äògreen‚Äô markets as well as cash borrowing and debt
payoff, dividend payouts and player-to-player trading. For our baseline results, the reward function is
designed in parallel with the goals of a Major and the desires of its investors: to maximize shareholder
value. The only tangible method for 2DP-MARL agents to achieve this in-game, therefore, is to
maximize total dividend payouts. Focusing the reward function on dividend payouts requires a
company to maximize its capital efÔ¨Åciency in response to its competitors‚Äô choices and the scenario at
play. Negative rewards are introduced to encourage robust strategies and realistic agent behavior akin
to the Majors they represent. Table 1 tabulates an overview of the applied baseline reward function.
2DP-MARL agents are trained across 408 IAMC/IIASA energy transition scenarios. Upon reaching
the endgame, at year 2040, the environment resets to generate a new climate-aligned scenario at
random. Unique to each IAMC/IIASA scenario are the projections with respect to oil and gas
demand, dictating the respective carbon asset‚Äôs production and pricing values. Appendix B displays
all unique IAMC/IIASA oil and gas demand projections. Other global scenario metrics that shape the
environment‚Äôs dynamics, such as debt interest, ‚Äògreen‚Äô return on investment, and available ‚Äògreen‚Äô
assets for acquisition, are drawn directly from the original 2DP wargame.
4 Baseline Results & Analysis
Figure 1: Convergence of (a) average rewards and (b) loss function captured while training the
2DP-MARL model across several random seeds.
Upon convergence, after over 130,000 epochs, Figure 1, trained 2DP-MARL agents were evaluated
across all IAMC/IIASA scenarios to reveal robust strategy pathways unique to each climate-aligned
scenario. Individual Majors‚Äô yearly average dividend payouts and market valuation as well as oil and
gas, ‚Äògreen‚Äô and debt asset holdings across all IAMC/IIASA scenarios are displayed in Figure 2.
While merely a baseline test, meaningful insights can immediately be drawn from the results. Amidst
energy transition uncertainty, Majors successfully realize robust strategies as their market valuations,
Figure 2(a), and dividend payouts, Figure 2(b), are maximized by the endgame. To further understand
the emerged robust business models, average oil and gas, ‚Äògreen‚Äô and debt asset holdings are examined.

(d) gas, (e) ‚Äògreen‚Äô and (f) debt asset holdings across all IAMC/IIASA scenarios.
Oil. At the game‚Äôs start, Majors largely divest from their oil asset portfolios, Figure 2(c), suggesting
both the desire to leave the market quickly as well as exploit oil‚Äôs high, short-term returns before
effects of oil demand shocks take place.
Gas. Within gas markets, Figure 2(d), Majors pursue gradual investment strategies highlighting both
the carbon asset‚Äôs inÔ¨Çuence on market valuation and potential in realizing stable, long-term returns.
‚ÄòGreen‚Äô. Across all IAMC/IIASA scenarios, Majors Ô¨Ånd solace in ‚Äògreen‚Äô markets, Figure 2(e), a
result of Majors learning the robust returns inherent to the game‚Äôs asset. All Majors exhibit Ô¨Årst
low-carbon mover behavior and continue large-scale, low-carbon investment throughout the game‚Äôs
entirety, supporting the case for full diversiÔ¨Åcation. All Majors become prominent low-carbon leaders.
Debt. Observing debt, Figure 2(f), it is evident that leveraged Ô¨Ånancial plays prove vital for the
Majors to adapt to new business models. Early peaks in debt accumulation coincide with Ô¨Årst
low-carbon mover behaviors suggesting Majors exploit low-cost cost capital early such to realize
stable, long-term ‚Äògreen‚Äô returns and, thus, allow for manageable debt burdens.
Evidently, the results of 2DP-MARL indicate that quickly adapting to low-carbon business models
proves a robust strategy amidst energy transition uncertainty. Majors achieve these by exploiting oil‚Äôs
short-term returns and enacting high leverage plays to acquire signiÔ¨Åcant levels of ‚Äògreen‚Äô assets‚Äîa
strategy deemed as a leveraged transition. While proving ideal in the long-term, such early ‚Äògreen‚Äô
diversiÔ¨Åcation strategies risk considerable short-term market valuation decline and dividend cuts.
Understanding these upside and downside risks inherent to Ô¨Årst low-carbon movement is critical for
Majors and their shareholders to enact a smooth transition and mitigate loss in worst-case scenarios.
5 Conclusion
The 2DP-MARL model supports the call for oil Majors to diversify into low-carbon business models
by identifying Ô¨Årst low-carbon mover potential outcomes and, thus, the robust strategies Majors
should take in response to energy transition uncertainty. Though the model serves as a generalization
as to what types of capital allocation strategies would prove most beneÔ¨Åcial for the company and its
shareholders, meaningful insights from the emergent robust strategies can be drawn with respect to
such actors. Future developments of 2DP-MARL seek to explore ‚Äògreen‚Äô assets at a more granular
level and answer corporate governance questions central to the industry‚Äôs future in a climate-aligned
4world, greatly increasing this work‚Äôs impact. While largely responsible for climate degradation, the
Majors have the opportunity to serve as energy transition vanguards. The 2DP-MARL model has the
potential to help guide the Majors‚Äô decision-makers in realizing carbon-neutral business pathways to
accelerate the the global low-carbon energy transition.
Appendix
A 2DP-MARL Adjustments & Additions
While a majority of the game logic seen in the original 2DP wargame has be replicated for this work‚Äôs
model, this appendix details essential adjustments and additions made to enable the implementation
of deep MARL methods and best mimic real-life market competition. A high-level overview of the
presented 2DP-MARL model is displayed in Figure 3.
Figure 3: High-level view of the 2DP-MARL model where Majors act as agents within the 2DP
wargame environment under a given IAMC/IIASA scenario. Each agent ktakes an action within the
environment at each timestep t, representing a single year within the game. Subsequently, agents
receive a new observation, sk
t+1, and reward, rk
t+1, both of which predicated on the agent‚Äôs actions as
well as those of others, ak. Upon reaching the endgame at 2040, the game resets agents to their initial
state at 2020 and a new IAMC/IIASA scenario is generated at random.
A.1 Asset Initialization
The original asset categories utilized in the 2DP wargame remain the same for the developed model.
However, initial assets are drawn from each Majors‚Äô most recent Ô¨Ånancial statements as well as other
publicly available data. Table 2 tabulates each asset along with the respective source and justiÔ¨Åcation.
A.2 Decision-Making Metrics
Most decision-making metrics were drawn directly from the 2DP wargame, however, critical changes
were made to the Return on Investment (ROI), now Return on Assets (ROA), and Total Enterprise
Value (TEV) equations in order to achieve an accurate representation of real-world values. Table 3
tabulates the decision-making metrics, their equations, and respective source of justiÔ¨Åcation.

A.3 Global Scenario Metrics
Global scenario metrics determine the dynamics of the 2DP-MARL environment. As stated in Section
3, oil and gas demand values are contingent on the IAMC/IIASA scenario being played. Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) & others‚Äô production share, available ‚Äògreen‚Äô assets for
acquisition, and ‚Äògreen‚Äô return on investment value ranges were kept the same across all scenarios.
Table 4 tabulates these metrics as well as their respective value range and source.
7A.4 Agent Observations
Agent observations describe the elements in which each agent has access to with respect to its
environment and opponents. The 2DP-MARL model follows the POSG framework, restricting agent
observations to an incomplete view of its surroundings, thus mimicking company observations in
real-life market competition. An agent‚Äôs observations within the 2DP-MARL model include all its
own assets and decision-making metrics as well as complete information of the scenario at hand.
However, an agent maintains an incomplete observation for each competing agent, only observing
their on-hand assets.
B All IAMC/IIASA Scenario Demand Projections
As stated in Section 3, unique to each IAMC/IIASA scenario at play are the projections with respect
to oil and gas demand. Figure 4 charts these metrics for each IAMC/IIASA scenario.
