1 Introduction
Carbon pricing is an economically efficient instrument in the policy toolkit to signal emis-
sions’ actual cost. Emissions trading systems are market-based mechanisms where a cap is
set on certain sectors’ emissions and the entities covered are allowed to trade emissions al-
lowances. The world’s first international carbon market, the EU Emissions Trading System
(ETS), was implemented in 2005. ETS prices stayed low for a long time but finally started
to rise in 2017. The ETS allowance prices skyrocketed in 2021, reaching almost €100 in
February 2022. Nevertheless, prices dropped below €60 in early-March after the disruptions
caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Our contribution to the literature on carbon pricing is twofold. First, we propose a new EU
Climate Change News Index (ECCNI) that tracks the ongoing discussion in the EU about
climate change using global media sources. Although some articles have already incorpo-
rated news information into the forecasting of ETS prices (Ye and Xue, 2021; Zhang and
Xia, 2022), no meaningful feature has been created that captures the media’s climate policy-
related discussions. We apply term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) feature
extraction to the GDELT1news database to measure the frequency of climate change-related
keywords in the news associated with the EU. The TF-IDF features help to quantify the
intensity of the discussion about climate change in the EU and to incorporate policy context
in the analysis of carbon prices.
Second, we apply the news index to predict the next day’s ETS allowance price returns. We
test the forecast accuracy of the ECCNI against a set of control variables taken from the
literature. Our results suggest that the occurrence of climate change-related keywords in
the most reliable news sites improves the forecasts of the ETS prices.
Several quantitative methods have already been developed in academic literature to fore-
cast carbon prices. Zhao et al. Zhao et al. (2018) categorizes these papers into two groups:
(1) forecasting based on time-series data using carbon price only; (2) extending with eco-
nomic and energy data too. The carbon price-only methods mostly include ARIMA models;
however, they can only capture linear relationships (Zhu and Chevallier, 2017). Therefore,
more advanced frameworks have been applied to carbon prices, like different varieties of
generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models (Arouri et al.,
2012; Benschopa and L´ opez Cabreraa, 2014; Byun and Cho, 2013) and vector autoregressive
(VAR) models (Arouri et al., 2012).
Nevertheless, carbon price-only methods do not incorporate all available information in the
market. Various articles that aim to forecast carbon prices use economic and energy-related
variables proxying the demand for CO 2allowances (Arouri et al., 2012; Gu ðbrandsd´ ottir
and Haraldsson, 2011; Zhao et al., 2018). Recently, alternative predictors, e.g., news data
through natural language processing (NLP), have also been used to forecast ETS prices (Ye
and Xue, 2021; Zhang and Xia, 2022). However, they only included the headlines and titles
of online news from limited sources and consequently could only examine carbon prices with
a weekly frequency. To shed more light on the impact of news on daily ETS prices, we create
features by applying the TF-IDF method to the GDELT news dataset. TF-IDF has been
1The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project is a real-time
network diagram and database of global human society for open research that monitors the
world’s broadcast, print, and web news in over 100 languages. For more information, see:

1widely used to improve the forecast accuracy of stock prices (Coyne et al., 2017; Lubis et al.,
2021; Mittermayer, 2004; Nikfarjam et al., 2010).
2 Data
The main contribution of this study is the conversion of online news articles to meaningful
variables that enhances our understanding of ETS. Therefore, we use GDELT, a free open
platform covering global news from numerous countries in over 100 languages with daily
frequency. The database includes, along with others, the actors, locations, organizations,
themes, and sources of the news items (Leetaru and Schrodt, 2013). GDELT has been used
in various articles that apply NLP to extract alternative information from the news (Alamro
et al., 2019; Galla and Burke, 2018; Guidolin and Pedio, 2021).
We take the daily futures closing prices of the European Union Allowance (EUA) ( €/ton)
as the dependent variable since that is the underlying carbon price of ETS. Besides news
data, we include the most fundamental drivers of ETS prices (Ye and Xue, 2021) in our
analysis to serve as control variables.
The data was collected from January 2, 2018 until November 30, 2021, with 1011 daily
observations in total. The availability of control variables gave the starting date, and the
end was determined to avoid the possible distorting effect of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.
However, the latest ECCNI values are available on the EU ETS news tracker dashboard.
3 Methodology
3.1 Article collection
Our ECCNI relies on the GDELT database that gathers a wide range of online news with
daily frequency. Thus, to focus our analysis, we restricted the dataset to the articles where
the actor is European Union orEUand extracted their URL-s. We chose to filter on the
actor to focus on issues and policies that are dealt with by the EU. Moreover, carbon prices
are also affected by global trends; consequently, filtering based on geography would not be
adequate.
Moreover, we removed the articles from the database that were coming from unreliable
sources. For this purpose, we used one of the most cited media bias resources, Media Bias
Fact Check (MBFC) (MBFC, 2022). We removed the articles from the data that appeared
on ‘questionable’ websites according to the ‘Factual/Sourcing’ category of MBFC2.
After the filtering, the overall number of news sites was reduced from 9,497 to 719, from
which our web scraper collected 27,777 articles.
3.2 Feature generation workflow
We performed basic string pre-processing steps on the raw texts using the Natural Language
Toolkit (NLTK) package (Bird et al., 2009). This package was also used to lemmatize words
with WordNetLemmatizer, a more advanced solution than standard stemming because of
the addition of morphological analysis. Since our keyword collection contains several multi-
word elements, bigrams and trigrams were also formed with the lemmatizer to create the
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, which is one of the most
commonly used methods for NLP. The TF-IDF method is an adequate tool to incorporate
alternative information to forecast financial time series (Coyne et al., 2017; Lubis et al., 2021;
Mittermayer, 2004; Nikfarjam et al., 2010). It is generally accepted that the normalized form
of TF-IDF is more effective than Bag-of-words methods in terms of ignoring common words,
and it is also able to highlight rare terms.
2We are grateful to Courtney Pitcher who fetched the data from MBFC and published an
organized dataset on her blog (Pitcher, 2019).
2The rows of our calculated matrix represent the individual articles, and its columns are the
elements of the partially external, partially custom-defined keyword list. We gathered our
keywords around five main groups: fossil fuels, renewable energy carriers, energy policy,
emissions and gas as an independent topic. We used keyword suggestions from Google
Trends and our intuition to expand the mentioned groups. The complete list of keywords
is shown in Table A.1. We calculated the score for each keyword so it can also be used for
further detailed analysis. Still, due to the high variance of the occurrences and the strong
correlation between the keyword groups, we created the EU Climate Change News Index as
the aggregated TF-IDF score of the groups.
4 Results
In this section, we present the ECCNI, the index constructed from the TF-IDF features that
are derived using our methodology described in Section 3. First, we assess the evolution
of the index qualitatively by walking through the most important events related to climate
change in the EU since 2020. We then use OLS and ElasticNet models to test the forecasting
ability of the index.
4.1 EU Climate Change News Index
Since policy uncertainty is substantial around the ETS system, measuring the intensity of
debate around it is crucial. One of the key drivers of the ETS prices is the EU’s ever-
increasing emissions reduction targets, which set a cap on the number of ETS allowances.
Nevertheless, various other policy measures also impact carbon prices as sectoral policies,
like green energy mandates.

Raw scores
30-day moving average
We present the evaluation of the ECCNI between January 2, 2018, and November 30, 2021,
in Figure 1. The index is highly volatile, but several cycles are outlined in the 30-days moving
average. In the followings, we concentrate on the events influencing the index starting from
2020. In January and February 2020, the index reached a relatively high and stable level
due to the recent presentation of the EU Green Deal. Then, in March 2020, the index
started to decrease steadily as the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the public discourse in the
EU. However, the concept of ’green recovery’ soon emerged, and climate change keywords
again started trending. In October 2020, COVID-19 cases soared again, pushing down the
index. The European Council endorsed a binding EU target of a net domestic reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), leading to
3a local peak at the end of the year. The proceeding period was less volatile; however, in
June 2021, the index jumped to a higher level as the European Council endorsed the new
Renovation Wave strategy, and in July, the ’Fit for 55’ package was presented. Finally, the
climate change news index peaked in November 2021 as the 26th Conference of the Parties
(COP26) was held between October 31 and November 13 in Scotland. The most recent
TF-IDF scores of the EU Climate Change News Index and the keyword groups is available
on the EU ETS news tracker dashboard.
4.2 Forecasting performance
We argue that the EU Climate Change News Index can track the ongoing discussion about
the ETS. Since ETS prices are strongly dependent on the policy environment and the mea-
sures introduced, the index could potentially help to better predict the evolution of carbon
prices in the EU. Therefore, in the followings, we test the forecasting performance of the
index. In our analysis, we compare three models to measure the forecasting performance
of the ECCNI. The first ( TF-IDF ) model includes the lags of the ETS price returns ( rt)
and the ECCNI ( zt) as predictors. While the second model, called Control , serves as a
benchmark model which considers the lags of the ETS price returns and the fundamental
driving factors of carbon prices based on academic literature (lags of gas, electricity, coal,
oil and stock price returns represented by vector xtfor period t). The final, Full model
includes all predictors: the lags of the ETS price returns, the control variables’ price returns
and the ECCNI.
Only the lagged values of the predictors are included in the models to produce forecasts
that rely entirely on historical information. We run the models with k= 1,2,3,4,5 lags
for robustness purposes but only report the results from the best-performing models. Table
A.2 summarises the out-of-sample 1-day ahead forecast results ( MAE andRMSE ) of the
TF-IDF ,Control andFull models for carbon price return with different test windows. We
used the last n∈ {50,75,100}days of the sample for the out-of-sample testing to examine
the performance of the models on the most recent data.
Based on the results, the Full model consistently outperforms the others regardless of the
test window, the evaluation metric and the estimation method, while the TF-IDF model
produces the largest errors. These outcomes are in line with the literature exploring the
effectiveness of additional textual information in carbon price prediction (Ye and Xue, 2021;
Zhang and Xia, 2022). News information alone cannot outperform the control variables, but
extending these fundamental driving factors with the ECCNI provides additional predictive
power to ETS price forecasting. The ECCNI captures policy uncertainty and is able to track
the discussion about climate change in the EU.
5 Conclusions
In this paper we first aggregated textual information from online news articles representing
a novel data source for carbon price prediction. We produced TF-IDF features tracking the
relative occurrences of climate change-related keywords in online news related to the EU.
Then, we derived the EU Climate Change News Index as the aggregated TF-IDF score of
the keywords. The index accurately reflects the ongoing discussion about climate change in
the EU. It outlines the most influential events in the topic like the annual United Nations
Climate Change Conferences or the endorsement of the EU’s emissions reduction target of
at least 55% by 2030 below 1990 levels. Finally, we showed that the index brings valuable
additional information and predictive power to ETS price forecasting compared to a control
model where the traditional predictors of carbon prices are included.
The increasing ambition of the EU climate targets brings significant uncertainty to carbon
prices. ETS market participants are ever more exposed to the rapidly changing carbon
prices; hence, news articles about EU climate issues are highly relevant to their market
expectations. Therefore, the proposed ECCNI could also help to manage volatility in the
EU ETS. By integrating the index into forecasting models, companies can predict ETS
prices more accurately and lower their associated risks.

A Trading strategy backtesting
In this section we investigate whether the predictive ability of our index could be utilized
in trading strategies. We use a simple approach in which we buy ETS when the forecasted
return is positive, while we invest in cash when it is negative, following (Pesaran and Tim-
merman, 1995) (Pesaran and Timmermann, 1995). We use the forecasts of the models
presented in Table A.2. We compare the results of this active strategy during our out-of-
sample prediction windows with: (1) cash (where we assume 10 % annual interest rate);
(2) passively investing into ETS. The results are shown in Table B.5. This initial exercise
could be made more realistic with incorporating trading costs (which could be substantial
since we are rebalancing the portfolio daily) and by using a more appropriate benchmark in
terms of risk and return characteristics of the proposed active ETS trading strategy.
