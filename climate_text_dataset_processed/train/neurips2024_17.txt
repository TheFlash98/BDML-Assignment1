Abstract
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of synthetic fluorinated com- 1
pounds termed “forever chemicals”, have garnered significant attention due to their 2
persistence, widespread environmental presence, bioaccumulative properties, and 3
associated risks for human health. Their presence in aquatic ecosystems highlights 4
the link between human activity and the hydrological cycle. They also disrupt 5
aquatic life, interfere with gas exchange, and disturb the carbon cycle, contributing 6
to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating climate change. Federal agencies, 7
state governments and non-government research and public interest organizations 8
have emphasized the need for documenting the sites and the extent of PFAS con- 9
tamination. However, the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection 10
and analysis poses challenges. It hinders the rapid identification of locations at 11
high risk of PFAS contamination, which may then require further sampling or 12
remediation. To address this data limitation, our study leverages a novel geospatial 13
dataset, machine learning models including frameworks such as Random Forest, 14
IBM-NASA’s Prithvi and UNet, and geospatial analysis to predict regions with 15
high PFAS concentrations in surface water. Using fish data from the National 16
Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) dataset by the Environmental Protection 17
Agency (EPA), our analysis suggests the potential value of machine learning based 18
models for targeted deployment of sampling investigations and remediation efforts. 19
1 Background and Motivation 20
PFAS are a group of over 9,000 synthetic chemicals first manufactured in the late 1940s. Known for 21
their exceptional stability and resistance to degradation, PFAS are often termed "forever chemicals" 22
due to their persistence in the environment and tendency to bioaccumulate in living organisms. These 23
chemicals are found in the blood of 97% of Americans, according to the CDC, and have contaminated 24
the drinking water of over 110 million people in the U.S. alone [ 1] - [2] . Human exposure to 25
Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.PFAS occurs through various pathways, including contaminated food, drinking water, air, household 26
products, and dust. Exposure to some PFAS is associated with serious health issues, including 27
cancer. Additionally, some PFAS are classified as fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHGs), which 28
are typically the most powerful and enduring greenhouse gases [ 3]. Inefficient waste management 29
practices involving PFAS-containing materials have further contributed to their widespread pollution 30
[4]. 31
Given the complexity of environmental and health risks like those posed by PFAS, artificial intelli- 32
gence (AI) has the potential to be a powerful tool to help identify the scope of contamination and 33
areas of highest priority for remediation. There is precedence that AI has the potential to automate 34
labor-intensive tasks, more strategically utilize and benefit from domain expertise, and derive valuable 35
insights from complex datasets, in domains ranging from conservation, to health, to agriculture [ 5]. 36
These domains also frequently use geospatial and remote sensing data for tasks such as land cover 37
mapping [6], disease prediction [7], and agricultural productivity assessments [8]. 38
In the context of PFAS contamination, spatial analysis has been employed to map pollution sources 39
like industrial facilities and waste management areas [ 9], predict PFAS levels in fish tissue, and 40
assess contamination risks at specific sites [ 10]. Recent work has also focused on predicting PFAS 41
contamination in groundwater at a national scale [ 11]. Despite these advancements, many spatial 42
analysis methods remain labor-intensive and require significant domain knowledge, which can hinder 43
their scalability and efficiency. 44
Our study aims to address these limitations by comparing different machine learning models and 45
data processing techniques. These include advanced models like IBM-NASA’s Prithvi [ 12] and 46
UNet [ 13], as well as traditional models like Random Forest [ 14], coupled with a novel geospatial 47
dataset to predict PFAS concentrations in surface water. By integrating diverse data sources, including 48
environmental and industrial factors, our predictive models identify areas at high risk of contamination. 49
These models, once further validated by field sampling, can help guide environmental policy and 50
intervention efforts in real time. 51
2 Methods 52
2.1 Dataset processing 53
Our study focuses on classifying high and low PFAS concentrations in the U.S. using fish tissue 54
PFAS concentration data from the NRSA [ 15] dataset. Samples were classified as high (1) or low (0) 55
concentration based on the U.S. EPA’s Fish and Shellfish Advisory Program thresholds, determined 56
for each type of PFAS in fish tissue. The individual assessments were combined to produce a final 57
hazard quotient, where 1 indicates a high hazard and 0 indicates a low hazard. The NRSA dataset 58
consists of 800 sample points across various years, with only 52 classified as 0, making it highly 59
imbalanced. 60
We use a variety of datasets to predict PFAS contamination, including the U.S. Environmental 61
Protection Agency (EPA) Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) PFAS dischargers’ 62
data [ 16], which provides point data in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, and raster 63
datasets like the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) [ 17], Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 64
elevation data [18], and the Watershed Boundaries Dataset (WBD) [19]. These diverse data sources 65
present unique challenges because point data like ECHO requires spatial context, while raster data 66
like NLCD is inherently image-based. 67
To address this challenge, we analyzed two complementary approaches for data processing: tabular 68
and image-based. 69
The tabular approach combined multiple data sources, extracting features within a 5 km radius around 70
each sample point. These features included land cover percentages, mean elevation, median values 71
of remote sensing indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized 72
Difference Water Index (NDWI), and distances to the nearest facility types. 73
2In the image-based approach, we created multichannel raster images at a 30m resolution, each sized 74
512x512 pixels, centered on the sample points. Each image incorporated different data sources, 75
including portions of rasters derived from EPA ECHO, NLCD, DEM, and other satellite data products, 76
enabling a visual representation of the tabular features. Visualizations of some channels in a sample 77
image are shown in Figure 1. 78
To generate labels for our images, given the point-level nature of our raw label data, we experimented 79
with different configurations. Our most intuitive approach was to label all surface water areas in the 80
image patch as 0 or 1, indicating high or low PFAS concentration, based on the known label at the 81
center. This approach was chosen to prevent the imbalance that would result from labeling only a 82
single pixel per image patch. It is important to note that this strategy is noisy due to the lack of ground 83
truth data beyond the specific point locations, where only the points themselves provide verified data. 84
We chose a BootStrapping cross-entropy loss function [20] to account for these noisy labels. 85
Figure 1: The figure shows three channels of a sample image from the dataset: (1) the watershed-
elevation channel, (2) the NLCD channel, and (3) the discharger channel. The images are arranged
from left to right.
2.2 Experimental design 86
For both the tabular and image-based data modalities, we applied a spatially stratified split to divide 87
the data into training and test sets. This approach ensured that there was no geographic overlap 88
between the regions surrounding the different points, allowing us to account for spatial variability. 89
We experimented with multiple models. First, for image-based data, we implemented the Prithvi 90
model architecture, which features a transformer-based architecture adapted for geospatial data. 91
Initially, the model was pre-trained using a Masked Autoencoder approach on our image data, which 92
enabled the model to learn robust feature representations. We pre-trained our model here instead 93
of directly using the Prithvi weights since raw satellite imagery does not fully capture the nuances 94
needed to predict PFAS in aquatic ecosystems. Derived geospatial data products, like land cover, 95
are not only more relevant but also enhance model explainability. The encoder was then initialized 96
with these pre-trained weights and the decoder was subsequently finetuned using our label masks. 97
In addition to the Prithvi model, a UNet architecture was utilized equipped with deep supervision, 98
attention gates, and pyramidal pooling modules. The training was conducted using a BootStrapping 99
cross-entropy loss function, which helped address label noise by blending the model’s predictions 100
with the ground truth, reducing the impact of potentially incorrect labels. We also used a Random 101
Forest model with the tabular version of the data, following the approach outlined by Smith et al. 102
[10]. This model relies on an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. The direct data points 103
(0 and 1) were used as labels in this model. 104
In this study, we evaluated model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Among 105
these, we prioritize F1-score because it balances precision and recall, making it especially relevant for 106
distinguishing high or low PFAS concentration areas where both false positives and false negatives 107
have significant consequences. This approach ensures a robust evaluation of the models’ ability to 108
guide targeted interventions. Performance validation will be further supported by field sampling. For 109

We report the results in Table 1. The results from Prithvi are based solely on the verified actual 113
points from the NRSA dataset, ensuring accurate validation. Overall, the Prithvi model seems to 114
perform generally better across the NRSA data. We hypothesize that the Prithvi model, pre-trained 115
using a masked autoencoder, provides a performance boost by extracting deep, meaningful features 116
from geospatial data. The combination of initial feature pre-training and fine-tuning using label 117
masks appears to enable the model to capture nuances in surface water contamination data, yielding 118
generally better results overall. However, we also hypothesize that the results on the 2019 data may 119
be more varied due to a more severe class imbalance compared to the 2008 data. 120
On the tabular dataset, we outperformed the baseline Random Forest results from [ 10], which achieved 121
81% accuracy on the NRSA dataset focused on the Columbia River Basin region. Using the same 122
model on our train and test sets, this result underscores the importance of dataset context. 123
Due to its strong performance, our Prithvi model, trained on 2008 NRSA samples, was tested on 124
a Michigan area near some ground truth points from the same dataset to assess generalization, as 125
shown in Figure 2. The predicted high concentration areas (purple) in Figure 2 generally align well 126
with the high concentration ground truth points (purple), particularly in closer proximity. While this 127
is a simplified observation, it highlights the potential of the model’s generalization capability and 128
represents a promising first step, which will be further validated through field testing. 129

44 Discussion 130
The main contribution of this work is to lay the groundwork for AI-generated maps of PFAS 131
contamination in surface water, starting with estimated PFAS levels in fish tissue. In future work, we 132
aim to quantify uncertainty in labels and in output predictions to both improve performance, and to 133
prepare to communicate results to potential users and impacted communities. This will be important 134
to inform decision-making, given the potential impact on public health and home property values 135
[21], and environmental justice implications [22]. We aim to convey this uncertainty via maps [23]. 136
To tackle this challenge, we aim to design loss functions to better quantify label uncertainty and 137
incorporate PFAS domain knowledge, such as groundwater flow and proximity to toxic facilities. 138
Additionally, a regression task could offer deeper insights than classification, if we can overcome the 139
added sparse data challenges. 140
Community-driven mapping efforts, like those by the PFAS Project [ 24], West Plains Water Coalition 141
[25], and the Environmental Working Group [ 26], have raised awareness of PFAS pollution. Moving 142
forward, we plan to collaborate with local community partners in water pollution and sustainability 143
to refine our predictive map. We will seek their input on its accuracy and usefulness, building on our 144
existing partnership with a nonprofit organization. 145

A Dataset Processing 215
A.1 Image data 216
Initially, rasters were created for the entire contiguous U.S., including distance transform rasters 217
that represent the distance to the nearest discharger of a specific type. The types of dischargers 218
used in our data include aluminium forming, concentrated aquatic animal production, construction 219
and development, copper forming, drinking water treatment, inorganic chemicals manufacturing, 220
landfills, metal finishing, nonferrous metal forming, oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining, 221
pharmaceutical manufacturing, pulp, paper, and paperboard, steam electric power generating, timber 222
products processing, waste combustors, airports, military bases, and Aqueous Film Forming Foam 223
(AFF) spills data as well. 224
Additionally, we created a raster combining slope data with watershed boundaries to account for 225
potential upstream and downstream flows. For each sample point, we extracted 512x512 pixel patches 226
for each of these rasters, covering approximately 236 km ²area, centered around the sample point. 227
These individual raster patches were then combined to an image with multiple channels. 228
B Training configuration 229
For the tabular dataset, the training set comprised 80% of the data, while the test set included 20%. 230
The spatially stratified split involved assigning certain U.S. States to the training set and others to the 231
test set, ensuring that the geographic distribution of the data was preserved. For the image dataset, 232
patches were split into 70% for training and 30% for testing, ensuring no geographic overlap of 233
patches between the sets. The UNet and Prithvi models were subsequently trained for 1000 epochs 234
using the bootstrapping cross-entropy loss function 235
Training also utilized a custom learning rate scheduler, starting with a warmup phase and transitioning 236
to polynomial decay, which helped stabilize the learning process. 237
