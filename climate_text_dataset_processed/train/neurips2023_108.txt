Abstract
As the global deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology
intensifies in the fight against climate change, it becomes increasingly imperative
to establish robust monitoring and detection mechanisms for potential underground
CO2leakage, particularly through pre-existing or induced faults in the storage
reservoir’s seals. While techniques such as history matching and time-lapse seismic
monitoring of CO 2storage have been used successfully in tracking the evolution of
CO2plumes in the subsurface, these methods lack principled approaches to charac-
terize uncertainties related to the CO 2plumes’ behavior. Inclusion of systematic
assessment of uncertainties is essential for risk mitigation for the following reasons:
(i) CO 2plume-induced changes are small and seismic data is noisy; (ii) changes
between regular and irregular (e.g., caused by leakage) flow patterns are small;
and (iii) the reservoir properties that control the flow are strongly heterogeneous
and typically only available as distributions. To arrive at a formulation capable of
inferring flow patterns for regular and irregular flow from well and seismic data,
the performance of conditional normalizing flow will be analyzed on a series of
carefully designed numerical experiments. While the inferences presented are
preliminary in the context of an early CO 2leakage detection system, the results
do indicate that inferences with conditional normalizing flows can produce high-
fidelity estimates for CO 2plumes with or without leakage. We are also confident
that the inferred uncertainty is reasonable because it correlates well with the ob-
served errors. This uncertainty stems from noise in the seismic data and from the
lack of precise knowledge of the reservoir’s fluid flow properties.
1 Introduction
According to the International Panel on Climate Change 2018 report [ 8], achieving a 50 %reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050 to avert a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in the Earth’s
average temperature is critical. It entails large-scale deployment of carbon reduction technologies,
most notably carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS involves the collection, transportation, and
injection of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into suitable underground geological storage sites. This long-term
storage process, known as Geological Carbon Storage (GCS), ranks amongst the scalable net-negative
CO2emission technologies. However, the viability of GCS is contingent on mitigating risks of
potential CO 2leakage from underground reservoirs, which can result from pre-existing fractures
in reservoir seals, as underscored in the study by [ 19]. For this reason, there is a pressing need
Accepted in Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Creation of training and testing data for the conditional normalizing flow. Training pairs are simulated
by running fluid flow simulations ( M) for random samples of the permeability ( K(i)∼p(K), i= 1···N).
These reservoir simulations produce samples for the CO 2saturation, x(i), i= 1···N, and pressure. The
simulated plumes are observed, via the observation operator H, directly at the well, producing localized
measurements for the saturation and pressure, and indirectly via imaged seismic reflection data collected at the
surface. The conditional normalizing flow is trained on pairs of CO 2saturation and corresponding time-lapse
observations collected in the vector y(i), i= 1···N. Each y(i)= (y(i)

to mitigate these risks by instituting robust monitoring systems capable of accurate prediction of
subsurface CO 2plume behavior.
Recently, several methods have emerged that leverage machine learning to detect CO 2leakage within
CO2storage complexes [ 10,28,5,25]. However, these techniques do not provide information on the
spatial extent of leakage and its uncertainty. Despite these shortcomings, advanced generative models
have been deployed successfully to predict the dynamic evolution of CO 2plumes based on saturation
and pressure data collected at the well(s) [ 27,22]. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study to
demonstrate how observed multi-modal (well and seismic) time-lapse monitoring data can be used to
improve inferences of both regular and irregular (e.g., due to leakage) CO 2-flow patterns including
quantification of their uncertainty. To carry out these inferences, we referred [ 20] which showed that
Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) can approximate posteriors of seismic imaging. We also
make use of CNF’s ability to handle non-uniqueness [ 20], an essential capability when dealing with a
nonlinear phenomena. While the presented reservoir and seismic simulations are realistic, this paper
can only be considered as an early attempt to demonstrate CNF’s ability to capture subtle differences
between regular and irregular flow patterns and their uncertainty from multi-modal time-lapse data.
2 Methodology
2.1 Conditional Normalizing Flows
Normalizing flows are generative models that approximate complex target distributions by applying a
series of invertible and differentiable transformations ( fθ:Rd→Rdwith inverse f−1
θ) on a base
known distribution (Normal distribution)[ 17]. After training, normalizing flows can generate samples
from the target distribution by performing the inverse operation on the base distribution. Since we
want samples from the conditional distribution, we utilize conditional normalizing flows [ 1] where
the mapping from the base density to the output space is conditioned on time-lapse observations yto
model the posterior distribution of CO 2saturation images, denoted as p(x|y), with xbeing CO 2
saturation image and ybeing time-lapse observables. The training objective is
L(θ) =Ex,y∼p(x,y)h

NPN

||fθ(x(i);y(i))||2
2
2−log|det(Jfθ(x(i),y(i)))|
,(1)
where Jrepresents the Jacobian of the network fθwith respect to its input. This training objective
corresponds to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target density and the
2pull-back of the standard Gaussian distribution defined by the invertible network[ 21,16]. The
expectation is approximated by an average of Ntraining samples. After training, posterior samples
of saturation images are generated by applying the inverse transformations to random Normal noise
realizations conditioned on the observed geophysical data. These posterior samples serve as a basis
for statistical analyses, including estimating the posterior variances to assess the uncertainty and to
make a high-quality point estimate. We use the posterior mean calculated by the routine in Appendix
A.
2.2 Dataset Generation
We select 850 2D vertical slices derived from the 3D Compass velocity model [ 4], to create the
training dataset for our conditional normalizing flows. This model, though synthetic, is obtained from
real seismic and well-log data and, thus, emulates the realistic geological characteristics prevalent
in the southeastern region of the North Sea. Each 2D slice corresponds in physical dimensions to
2131m ×3200m . To simulate the dynamics of CO 2flow, we follow [ 26] and convert the velocities
of the Compass model [ 4] to models of the permeability and porosity using empirical relationships
including the Kozeny-Carman equation [ 3]. The flow simulations are carried out with the open-source
packages Jutul.jl [ 15] and JutulDarcyRules.jl [ 24] while seismic data modeling and imaging are
done with JUDI [ 12], which is a Julia front-end to Devito [ 11,14], a just-in-time compiler for
industry-scale time-domain finite-difference calculations. Next, fluid flow and wave simulations are
briefly discussed. Refer to [13] for more detail on the numerical simulations.
2.2.1 Fluid Flow Simulations
To obtain a realistic CO 2injection, an injectivity of 1 MT/year is chosen with vertical injection
intervals inside the high permeability regions. As CO 2is injected supercritically, the CO 2saturations
and pressures are calculated by numerically solving the equations for two-phase flow. Details on
these numerical solutions of the partial-differential equations can be found in [ 18]. Two distinct flow
scenarios, namely regular flow (no-leakage) and irregular flow (leakage), are considered. During
no-leakage, the reservoir properties are kept constant resulting in regular CO 2plumes. However,
leakage occurs when the permeability changes at the reservoir’s seal, which results in an irregular
flow. While leakage can be caused by many mechanisms, we only consider the one due to pressure-
induced opening of pre-existing fractures in the seal. In this case, leakage is triggered when CO 2
injection pressure reaches a predefined threshold [ 19], resulting in an instantaneous permeability
increase within the seal causing the CO 2plume to leak out of the reservoir. To train the CNFs, 1700
multiphase flow simulations are performed ( N= 1700) , 850 with and 850 without leakage. In
practice, these fluid flow simulations can also be performed by computationally cheap surrogates
based on model-parallel Fourier neural operators [ 6], enhancing its adaptability to large-scale four-
dimensional scenarios. In the next section, we describe the formation of seismic images of these
regular/irregular plumes.
2.2.2 Time-lapse Seismic Imaging
As injection of CO 2induces changes in the Earth’s acoustic properties (velocity and density), these
changes can be observed seismically. To mimic the process of collecting time-lapse seismic data
followed by imaging, seismic baseline and monitor surveys are modeled. During these simulations,
the baseline survey represents the initial stage before CO 2is injected, and the monitor survey
corresponds to the time of 8 years after the injection. The seismic acquisition uses 8 sources and
200 ocean bottom nodes, along with a 15 Hz Ricker wavelet and a band-limited noise term with
a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8.0 dB. Reverse time migration (RTM) [ 2] is employed to create
time-lapse seismic images of the subsurface. Then, we isolate the time-lapse changes attributed to
CO2saturation by subtracting the baseline and monitor images.
3Figure 2: Outputs from the trained network for no-leakage case. Refer to Appendix B for details on performance
metrics and additional examples.
Figure 3: Same as Figure 2 but now for leakage case.
3 Training and Results
To create training pairs, {x(i),y(i)}1750
i=1, we resize the saturation dataset (x)into a 256 ×256 single
channel images and the time-lapse data (y)into 256 ×256×three channel images. The three
channels are the imaged seismic observations, pressure well, and saturation well data, respectively.
The architecture of the conditional normalizing flow is similar to [ 1]. Refer to Appendix A for further
details and hyperparameter selection.
After training, the conditional normalizing flow generates samples from the posterior distribution of
CO2saturation given unseen seismic and well observations. Figure 2 & Figure 3 show the outputs for
a no-leakage case and leakage case, respectively. The posterior means of the samples appear close to
the ground truth and have SSIM (see Appendix B) values of 0.97and0.96for the no-leakage and
leakage case. As expected, the uncertainty (normalized std) is higher in geologically complex areas
such as the top of the plume, which corresponds to the bottom of the seal and the fracture region
from where CO 2leaks out and it also correlates well with the error. We show more test samples in
Appendix B. Although there are errors in our method’s capability to find the exact extent of the plume,
we do not observe any false positives or false negatives (positive and negative refer to leakage and
no-leakage respectively) from the 36 test samples. In other words, all leakage scenarios are clearly
inferred as leakage and all no-leakage scenarios are inferred as no-leakage.
4 Conclusion and Discussion
Monitoring of GCS is complicated by highly nonlinear relationships between the reservoir properties,
the CO 2plumes, and time-lapse seismic observations. These complications are compounded by
the fact that the reservoir properties are only available statistically, making it difficult to detect
potential CO 2leakages that lead to subtly differing flow patterns. By employing carefully designed
4numerical experiments, we are able to demonstrate that conditional normalizing flows are capable
of capturing these subtle pattern changes during inference in a setting where training pairs consist
of realizations for the CO 2saturation and associated time-lapse data, consisting of seismic images
and well measurements, for scenarios that include regular and irregular (leakage) flow. Aside from
producing estimates for the CO 2saturation that only differ slightly from the ground truth, these
inferences also produce estimates for the uncertainty that correlate well with the errors. In future
work, we will study how this type of inference can lead to an uncertainty-aware ML-based monitoring
system capable of early leakage detection. This feasibility study can also serve as an initial step
towards constructing a digital twin of a geological carbon storage monitoring system that receives
real-time data updates, and employs simulation, machine learning, and reasoning methodologies
to facilitate decision-making processes. This can be achieved by employing sequential Bayesian
inference of CO 2plumes conditioned on time-lapse geophysical observations as discussed in [7].

Appendix B Generated Examples and Useful Definitions
Metric definitions used in Figures 2, 3, 4 & 5 and text:
SSIM - Structural similarity index quantifies the similarity between two images and is commonly used
to assess how closely a generated image resembles a ground truth or reference image. It considers
image quality aspects such as luminance, contrast, and structure. For the mathematical formulation
of SSIM, please refer to the study by [23].
8RMSE - Root mean squared error is used to represent the measure of difference between ground
truth CO 2saturation image and the posterior mean of the samples generated by the trained network.
Normalized std - It represents normalized point-wise standard deviation or mean-normalized standard
deviation. It is calculated by stabilized division of the standard deviation by the envelope of the
conditional mean [21]. It is used to avoid the bias from strong amplitudes in the estimated image.
