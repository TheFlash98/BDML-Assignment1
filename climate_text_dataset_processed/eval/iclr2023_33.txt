Abstract
Carbon offset programs are critical in the fight against climate
change. One emerging threat to the long-term stability and vi-
ability of forest carbon offset projects is wildfires, which can
release large amounts of carbon and limit the efficacy of asso-
ciated offsetting credits. However, analysis of wildfire risk to
forest carbon projects is challenging because existing mod-
els for forecasting long-term fire risk are limited in predic-
tive accuracy. Therefore, we propose an explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) model trained on 7 million global satel-
lite wildfire observations. Validation results suggest substan-
tial potential for high resolution, enhanced accuracy projec-
tions of global wildfire risk, and the model outperforms the
U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research’s leading fire
model. Applied to a collection of 190 global forest carbon
projects, we find that fire exposure is projected to increase
55% [37-76%] by 2080 under a mid-range scenario (SSP2-
4.5). Our results indicate the large wildfire carbon project
damages seen in the past decade are likely to become more
frequent as forests become hotter and drier. In response, we
hope the model can support wildfire managers, policymakers,
and carbon market analysts to preemptively quantify and mit-
igate long-term permanence risks to forest carbon projects.
1 Introduction
The United Nations considers carbon offsets and associated
carbon credits a critical tool to speed up climate action [1].
One of the main types of offset programs is forest carbon
offsets, which involve activities such as reforestation, avoid-
ance of deforestation, and improved forest management. In
exchange for these actions, forest projects are awarded car-
bon credits, which can be sold on carbon markets to indi-
viduals, businesses, and governments wishing to support the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Such market-based
mechanisms are designed to incentivize climate action and
reduce costs, with one estimate that carbon offset markets
can reduce the cost of implementing countries’ current re-
duction commitments by more than half ($250 billion) by
2030 [2].
Along with the growth in carbon markets is the recog-
nition that carbon offset credits need to be externally vali-
dated to determine whether they are credible and will de-
liver the climate benefits they promise. Central to carbon

credits is the idea of permanence, or the long-term stabil-
ity of emissions reductions claimed by a project, a period
of several decades and up to 100 years. This means that
the carbon sequestration or emissions reductions associated
with the credit must not be reversed in the future, for exam-
ple by illegal deforestation or natural disturbances. Concern
over unverified carbon credits and projects delivering off-
sets lower than reported has led to claims of ‘greenwashing’.
Such credibility doubts can affect individuals and corpora-
tions alike. For example, as companies seek to enact their
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, they
want to ensure carbon credits purchased to improve their
ESG scores are trustworthy.
Climate change, through its impacts on wildfire, poses a
growing threat to forest carbon projects, jeopardizing theirlong-term ability to reduce carbon emissions. Wildfires are
a present danger to offset projects because they immedi-
ately release aboveground carbon to the atmosphere and can
likewise increase soil carbon losses [3]. Unfortunately, re-
cent work suggests current wildfire risk to carbon credits is
severely underestimated. A 2022 audit estimated that nearly
all of the carbon credits set aside by California’s cap and
trade program were exhausted by recent wildfires, a buffer
pool intended to last 100 years [4].
Compounding the effects of wildfires, increased drought
stress in response to climate change can limit the ability of
forests to sequester carbon and make them more vulnera-
ble to wildfires [5]. Drought-stressed forests may also be
more susceptible to insect infestation, and the range of inva-
sive species is increasing as climates shift [6]. For instance,
the bark beetle has killed nearly 5% of western U.S. forests
since 1997, and they are expected to continue to spread
because of climate change [6]. Combined, the interplay of
increasing wildfire risk, drought severity, and insect stress
in response to climate change can create positive feedback
mechanisms that amplify carbon reversal risk in forest car-
bon projects [7].
Recent advances in AI can help us better quantify future
wildfire risk and the expected long-term impacts on forest
carbon projects. Super-resolution neural networks have been
built to increase the spatial resolution of fire models, with
the AI-enhanced projections used by multiple commercial
and nonprofit stakeholders [8]. Moreover, Cooper 2022 [9],
henceforth ‘Cooper 2022’, created a neural network con-
strained by scientific understanding of wildfire behavior to
improve fire forecasts globally.
Here we propose a comprehensive update to the Cooper
2022 model, with several methodological advances to im-
prove prediction performance as well as a novel validation
against a leading wildfire model. Further, we validate its
performance on a large collection of forest carbon offset
projects and assess current and future wildfire risks to for-
est carbon credits.
2 Data
Wildfires are a natural part of ecosystems but are increas-
ingly influenced by climate change and human behavior
[10]. We therefore incorporate a range of high resolution nat-
ural and anthropogenic input features indicative of fire initi-
ation and intensity. These inputs include local weather, bio-
climatic zones, land cover, topographic characteristics, and
population features.
2.1 Carbon Offset Projects
We focus on global forest carbon offset projects that are part
of the voluntary carbon market and whose credits are eligi-
ble for use under the California cap-and-trade program. A
total of 190 projects and corresponding polygon boundaries
were sourced from the American Carbon Registry, Climate
Action Reserve, and Verra project registries (Fig. 2) [11].
Projects range in size from less than 1km2to 11,500km2.
The largest project, VCS 1566, is associated with 25 mil-
lion carbon credits [11]. A carbon credit is worth 1 tCO 2e

fire risk provide broad geographic coverage, spanning 32
countries and 21 U.S. states.
and while varying in value, in 2021 was priced around $16
per credit [12]. Project locations span 32 countries, with the
most projects in the U.S. (76), China (25), Brazil (20), and
Colombia (15) (Fig. 2). Within the U.S., projects span 21
U.S. states, with roughly 1 in 4 in California.
2.2 NASA satellite fire occurrence
We use daily fire data provided by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) based on imagery from
NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites [13]. NASA’s global fire
data product indicates whether fire was observed at a given
pixel at a 500m resolution. Because intentional agricultural
burning is also detected by the satellites, we constrain model
training and validation to non-agricultural areas, isolating
for wildfire impacts. Figure 1 shows a satellite detected burn
scar from 2021 that burned approximately 11% of one of the
carbon offset projects (ACR255).
2.3 Fire Weather
Because local meteorological conditions are key drivers of
wildfires, we derive a daily fire weather index known as the
Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) as a principal input
to the model. KBDI is a widely used tool to inform fire
management decisions, such as fire suppression strategies
[14]. KBDI is calculated based on daily precipitation and
maximum temperature data, with higher values indicating
lower soil moisture, influencing the likelihood of ignition
and spread of wildfire. We derive historical KBDI values
from ERA5-Land data [15] available at 10km resolution and
future KBDI values from climate model simulations.
2.4 Climate Change Risk
We assess future impacts of climate change on wildfires
by deriving daily KBDI from climate model simulations of
temperature and precipitation. Simulations are from a set of
28 bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
phase 6 (CMIP6) models [16]. Recent advances in con-
trastive learning can also be used to bias-correct and super-
resolve the CMIP6 model inputs of future climate [17] and
is an area of active research. We use both historical simula-
tions spanning 2000 to 2015 and future simulations spanning
2016 to 2100 from three different carbon emissions scenar-
ios. Briefly, the three scenarios are: “Fossil-fueled Develop-
ment (Business as Usual)” SSP5-8.5, the scenario most con-
sistent with current carbon emissions; “Middle of the Road”(       ,   )

sistent with the Paris Climate Accord goal of below 2°C
global warming. Subjectively, we view the Middle of the
Road scenario, or alternatively a pathway between it and the
Business as Usual scenario, as the most realistic.
2.5 Bioclimatic Zones, Land Cover, and
Topography
Wildfire behavior varies considerably between different
ecosystems. For example, small, annual fires are common
in savanna ecosystems, while fires in dense North American
forests typically have larger footprints but are less frequent.
To capture the diversity of bioclimatic zones, we include 19
climate features from WorldClim [18] often used for ecosys-
tem and species distribution modeling.
We also include land cover features to complement the
bioclimatic zone features. Satellite-derived land cover is
provided by the European Space Agency at 300m resolution
[19]. We group the land cover into 6 classes: closed canopy
forest, open canopy forest, grassland, urban, agriculture, and
Other (e.g. bare soil, ice) (Fig. 1). Through feature engineer-
ing experimentation, we found that wildfire probability at a
given pixel is correlated not only with its land cover class
but also the land cover of its surroundings. We therefore in-
clude additional features that summarize the land cover type
in a surrounding 500m, 1km, and 2km radius of each pixel.
We include 6 features corresponding to local topography,
such as elevation and slope, which can play a large influence
on the spread and suppression of wildfire [20].
2.6 Human Dynamics
Human activity plays a considerable role in modern wildfire
behavior. For example, in California, the majority of fires
are now started by humans rather than by lightning [21]. We
include 3 features indicative of human activity that may in-
fluence fire ignition, suppression, and management. These
include subnational GDP as well as each pixel’s distance to
cities and accessibility [22]. Accessibility, or ‘friction sur-
face’, is a distance measure that accounts for transport net-
works, providing information on remote geographies diffi-
cult for firefighters to reach [23].3 Methodology
The wildfire model is first trained and validated globally on
land pixels with and without wildfire. We then further val-
idate model performance on forest carbon project locations
before modeling future wildfire risks to the offset projects.
17 million locations were sampled globally at random to
form the training and validation sets, with the training and
validation sets consisting of 7 million and 10 million loca-
tions, respectively. Oceans and water bodies are excluded
from sampling, as well as agricultural pixels. We exclude
agricultural pixels due to the overwhelming presence of agri-
cultural burning within the observational data. We found ex-
cluding these agricultural pixels results in a model more tar-
geted to wildfire prediction rather than intentional burns.
Training and validation samples are drawn from 2001 to
2009 and 2010 to 2021, respectively. Each sample includes
the annual presence or absence of wildfire as derived from
satellites in the sample year (response variable) along with
the corresponding observed annual mean KBDI value and
time-static features for the location.
Sample sizes were ultimately determined by computa-
tional constraints. The model was trained for 12 hours on 4
NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs with 104GB memory. The 7 mil-
lion training samples represent less than 5% of the possible
training data, suggesting opportunity for further prediction
skill improvement.
3.1 Network Architecture
We identified three key design goals for our network archi-
tecture:
• Explainable AI feature layer for KBDI
• Monotonically increasing wildfire probability with
KBDI
• Nonlinear relationships between remaining features
First, the geospatial relationships between KBDI and
wildfire probability are of regular interest scientifically and
for fire management, so a layer that facilitates KBDI in-
terpretability in particular is desirable. A monotonic rela-
tionship between wildfire probability and KBDI is desir-
able because of the body of scientific literature supporting
soil moisture association with wildfire ignition and spread.
Such science-informed constraints also have the beneficialeffect of reducing the search space, leading to faster train-
ing. Last, we expect the relationships between input features
to be highly nonlinear at a global level and therefore dense
layers within a neural network are desirable.
To achieve these design goals, we built a network combin-
ing feed-forward dense layers with a final KBDI layer with
the desired constraints (Fig. 3). All 54 input features aside
from KBDI are fed into dense layers with two final output
nodes. These nodes are then fed into a final layer where one
node serves as an intercept term β0and the other as a scaling
term β1for the KBDI input. The single output of this final
layer serves as a probability estimate for the binary response
variable [fire, no fire], with binary cross-entropy used as the
loss function.
The KBDI layer with constraints achieves the goal of
ensuring monotonicity and interpretability. While we do
not strictly enforce a monotonically increasing relationship,
as expected scientifically (drier conditions associated with
higher wildfire risk), in practice this is the result. The inter-
cept term β0(Fig. 3) can be interpreted as baseline global
wildfire risk, while the scaling term β1(Fig. 3) reflects the
sensitivity of a location to increases in fire weather like
warming and drought. Thus, in a location with a high value
forβ0and a low value for β1, there is a high historical prob-
ability of wildfire occurrence, but wildfire probability is rel-
atively less sensitive to weather and future climate impacts
than changes in other features in the model. Conversely, in
a location with a low value for β0and high value for β1,
fire probability has historically been low, but the model ex-
pects wildfire probability to be highly sensitive to novel fu-
ture conditions under climate change. We save a presentation
of this relationship, along with its variation geographically
and in time, for a separate analysis, since our focus here is
on carbon project exposure.
More details of the model architecture and typical out-of-
sample performance can be found in Cooper 2022. While the
architectures are similar, several advancements have been
made to improve performance: Removal of intentional agri-
cultural burns (see Methods); Inclusion of topographic fea-
tures; Doubling the total number of input features; Annual
aggregation of daily time-varying variables to align with
stakeholder use cases; and Modifications to the number of
nodes and layer connections. We elect not to publish pre-
cise hyperparameter choices like number of nodes per layer,
learning rate scheduler, and activation functions for this
model, though we highlight such information is publicly
available for Cooper 2022.
3.2 Validation
First, we evaluate predictions on the 10 million global held
out sample points with sample years corresponding to 2011
to 2021. In short, we find that this model outperforms
Cooper 2022 and the benchmark models referenced therein
(not shown). This improvement in performance supports the
model’s credibility in predicting global wildfire occurrence.
Second, because we are interested in the model’s pre-
diction skill in particular regions, namely the carbon offset
projects, we evaluate its performance locally in these re-
gions before making any projections of future carbon off-

ing the held out validation period from 2010-2021. We com-

model similarly outperforms Cooper 2022 (Appendix).
set project risk. To further support application of the model
to the carbon offset project collection, we benchmark pre-
dicted wildfire probabilities against projections from a lead-
ing fire simulation model from CMIP6, the National Cen-
ter for Atmospheric Research’s (NCAR) Community Earth
System Model 2 (CESM2) model [24]. CESM2 is a state-of-
the-art global climate model that includes a fire model esti-
mating burned area, and we use the ensemble mean burned
area from 8 runs of the climate model averaged over the vali-
dation period 2011 to 2021. Like our model, the CESM2 fire
model incorporates features related to dryness, land cover,
and human dynamics. A primary contrast between the two
models is that our model is largely data-driven, while the
CESM2 model is process-based. Ours is also capable of
forecasting at far higher spatial resolution, 300m as opposed
to 100km from CESM2.
4 Results
Wildfire was observed at 67 of 190 global offset projects
during the 2010 to 2021 validation period, suggesting these
forest carbon projects already are exposed to significant
wildfire risk. Of those, 39 projects saw more than 10% of
the project burned, representing a substantial impact to the
carbon sequestration potential of these forest projects. 18
additional projects experienced wildfire from 2001 to 2009,
highlighting that even if projects did not experience wildfire
during the validation period, they may still be at risk.
Evaluating the wildfire model performance on the for-
est carbon offset projects, we find that the wildfire model
substantially outperforms the benchmark NCAR CESM2
model. To assess performance, we compare satellite ob-served wildfires within the carbon project boundaries during
the held out validation period (Fig. 1), and calculate Area un-
der the Curve (AUC) scores for each model (Fig. 4). Higher
AUC scores are indicative of better predicting models. The
wildfire model has an AUC score of 0.79, and the bench-
mark CESM2 model has an AUC score of 0.68 for global
projects (Fig. 4). Similar validation over U.S. projects sug-
gests the wildfire model is an improvement relative to the
Cooper 2022 model as well (Appendix). Given the superior
performance of the wildfire model, we proceed to simulat-
ing future wildfire risk using CMIP6 climate simulations of
temperature and precipitation as inputs.
We find that wildfire risk to carbon offset projects across
the U.S. is projected to increase 34% [CI: 24-46%] by 2050
and 249% [195-337%] by 2080 under the Business as Usual
climate scenario (Fig. 4). Confidence intervals in brackets
represent climate model input uncertainties only, so these
are conservative estimates of uncertainty. Increased wild-
fire risk by the end of the century is even more striking,
at 376% [251-771%] under the same scenario. This ‘run-
away’ wildfire risk increase is likely driven by the extreme
level of global warming projected under this scenario, al-
though combined increases in severe drought can also in-
crease wildfire risk. For context, the Business as Usual cli-
mate scenario was designed by climate scientists and poli-
cymakers as a worst case pathway of unchecked emissions,
with many optimistic that it is avoidable if countries adhere
to current commitments.
Wildfire risk in 2050 and beyond is markedly reduced un-
der the more optimistic Middle of the Road climate scenario,
though risk is still expected to increase by 21% [17-31%]
by 2050 and 55% [37-76%] by 2080 (Fig. 5). Even under
the Sustainability pathway, risk increases 18% [15-19%] by
2050 and remains at similarly elevated levels through the
end of the century. This suggests that regardless of future
reductions in greenhouse carbon emissions, considerable in-
creases in wildfire risk are already ‘locked in’, posing a
threat to carbon credit permanence.
5 Conclusion
Forest carbon credits are intended to be a long-term solu-
tion to mitigating climate change, and buyers want to ensure
that the credits they purchase will provide lasting benefits to
the environment. However, we find that nearly half (45%)
of global forest carbon offset projects examined have expe-
rienced at least one wildfire since satellite records began in
2001. These projects thus already experience high levels of
fire exposure, jeopardizing their permanence and long-term
stability.
Here we propose an explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) model of wildfire risk trained on millions of global
locations and incorporating a range of geospatial features.
Validation results for the wildfire model suggest consider-
able potential for high resolution, enhanced accuracy projec-
tions of global wildfire risk. The wildfire model outperforms
the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research’s lead-
ing wildfire model as well as Cooper 2022, a prior model
version that previously underwent global validation and is
actively used by various commercial and nonprofit partners.
Figure 5: Forest carbon projects face substantial increases in
wildfire probability in the coming decades. To simulate fu-
ture wildfire probability, the wildfire model was paired with
climate inputs from an ensemble of 28 CMIP6 models under
three distinct climate emissions scenarios. Each line is the
mean estimated probability across the 190 offset projects,
with a 10-year smoothing applied for visualization.
The higher fidelity simulations of present and future wild-
fire risk made possible by our wildfire model can support
climate scientists and a broad range of stakeholders alike.
We find that the baseline carbon offset wildfire expo-
sure observed in this study is projected to increase sub-
stantially, upwards of 55% [37-76%] by 2080 under a mid-
range scenario, a clear concern for carbon credit permanence
and tackling climate change. Already, wildfires within offset
projects in the past decade alone have exhausted nearly all of
the carbon credits that California’s cap and trade program set
aside for wildfire losses, and that reserve was intended to last
100 years [4]. Unfortunately, our results indicate such large
carbon credit losses of the past decade are likely to become
far more frequent in the coming decades as forests become
hotter and drier. An encouraging outcome of our results is
that they show significant reductions in wildfire risk can be
achieved if countries commit to meeting emissions reduc-
tion targets that aim to keep emissions below the Middle of
the Road climate scenario.
A variety of stakeholders can benefit from quantifying cli-
mate risks to forest carbon offset projects as illustrated here.
Policymakers can set aside a greater share of carbon credits
in buffer pools for wildfire losses in order to maintain carbon
market stability, since our results indicate the losses of previ-
ous years are likely to increase [25]. Wildfire managers can
also use the projections to identify projects at risk and take
mitigation actions, such as controlled burns. Carbon market
analysts and ESG auditors can similarly use this model to as-
sess the permanence and credibility of carbon credits from
active and proposed forest offset projects globally.6 Future Directions
While this model represents a clear improvement over the
baseline NCAR model and Cooper 2022, the 7 million
points used in training represent less than 5% of available
data, so the model will likely continue to improve as more
data is included. To improve future forecasts, we also plan
to incorporate recent advances [17] in climate model gener-
ative adversarial networks (GANs) that can be used to bias-
correct and super-resolve the CMIP6 climate model inputs
for more accurate long-term wildfire forecasts.

Figure A1: To support application of the fire model to for-
est carbon projects, we validate the model (pink) during the
held out validation period from 2010-2021, here for the sub-
set of 68 contiguous U.S. projects. As in Fig. 4, we compare
Area under the Curve (AUC) scores against CESM2 (grey),
NCAR’s leading climate model, as well as Cooper 2022
(teal), a prior model version that has previously undergone
global validation. The wildfire model (pink) outperforms
both benchmark models. The Cooper 2022 model was run
only for the contiguous U.S. here to conserve computation
resources. For these U.S. projects, the wildfire fire model has
an AUC score of 0.85, and the benchmark CESM2 model
has an AUC score of 0.60. The Cooper 2022 model has an
AUC score of 0.78, suggesting the fire model is an improve-
ment relative to it as well.
Figure A2: Equivalent to Figure 5, showing uncertainty
ranges in dashed lines. Lower and upper bounds reflect the
16th and 84th percentile of the 28 CMIP6 model projections.
