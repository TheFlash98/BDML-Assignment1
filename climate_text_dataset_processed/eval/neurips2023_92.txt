Introduction
Alaska
faces
unique
energy
challenges
stemming
from
its
remote
location,
extreme
weather,
and 
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
[1,
2].
One
key
barrier
is
the
lack
of
granular,
large-scale
data
on
building 
energy
demands,
which
is
essential
to
decarbonization
efforts
in
supporting
climate
change 
mitigation.
While
previous
efforts
have
manually
collected
heating
load
measurements,
these 
studies
cover
only
small
areas.
In
contrast,
the
Alaska
Retrofit
Information
System
(ARIS)
[3,
4] 
contains
a
much
more
extensive
database
of
home
energy
audits.
ARIS
was
recently
released
for 
public
use,
however,
records
have
been
de-identified
in
terms
of
geolocation
to
only
zip
codes
to 
protect
personal
and
private
information.
This
paper
introduces
a
novel
framework
combining
machine
learning
and
geospatial
techniques 
to
map
ARIS
home
energy
data
at
the
building
level,
at
scale.
The
framework
presents
an
ethical 
approach
for
integrating
the
ARIS
database
with
housing
attributes
from
the
USA
Structures 
dataset
[5]
.
Through
clustering
and
validation,
the
framework
accurately
matches
records
across 
datasets
while
protecting
privacy,
using
clustering
to
match
records
privately.
The
contributions
of 
this
paper
are
threefold:
1)
highlighting
current
limitations
in
key
energy
data
sources;
2) 
providing
an
ethical
framework
for
integrating
such
datasets
at
scale
using
machine
learning;
and 
3)
demonstrating
how
this
approach
can
inform
sustainable
energy
policy
through
improved 
understanding
of
building
energy
loads.
Ethical
considerations
are
paramount
when
utilizing
geospatial
data
on
real
individuals
for
climate 
justice
[6]
.
Researchers
must
minimize
privacy
risks
and
socio-environmental
disparities.
Proper 
consent,
anonymization,
communication,
and
assessing
long-term
impacts
are
critical
for
ethical 
data
use
aligned
with
equity.

Overall,
this
work
exemplifies
how
artificial
intelligence 
and
geospatial
big

can
further
renewable
energy
goals
while
prioritizing
transparency
and 
fairness.

Previous
Work
Traditional
geospatial
analysis
methods
have
played
a
role
in
understanding
spatial
patterns
and 
making
informed
decisions
in
various
domains,
including
energy
resource
management;
however, 
these
methods
have
limitations
[7]
.
In
contrast,
cloud-based
geospatial
analytics
techniques,
such 
as
Google
Earth
Engine
(GEE),
have
emerged
as
a
leading
technique
in
geospatial
analysis 
[8]–[12]
,
offering
major
data
archives
and
enabling
users
to
perform
complex
geospatial
tasks
at 
scale
[13]–[15]
including
analysis
of
renewable
energy
potential
and
energy
infrastructure
changes 
[16]–[22]
.
Unsupervised
machine
learning
techniques
(ML),
such
as
K-means
clustering,
have 
gained
importance
when
uncovering
complex
geospatial
insights
regarding
energy
analytics 
challenges
[23]–[25]
.
K-means
clustering
has
been
applied
to
energy
research
[26]–[28]
to
identify 
consumption
patterns
and
group
regions
with
similar
energy
demand
profiles
[29]–[31]
.
On
the 
other
hand,
supervised
ML,
such
as
ensemble
learning
(e.g.,
Random
Forest
and
XGBoost),
have 
shown
promise
in
predicting
energy
consumption
and
optimizing
energy
efficiency
in
various 
applications
[18],
[32]–[37]
.
Despite
the
advances
in
machine
learning
techniques
[38]
,
current
research
addressing
heating
or 
cooling
loads
at
a
residential
level
only
focuses
on
improving
machine
learning
prediction
power 
[39]–[41]
,
implementing
IoT
devices
to
measure
city
resources
[42]
,
and
claim
to
be
data-driven, 
but
fail
to
address
transparency
and
ethical
concerns
regarding
the
existing
datasets.
Furthermore, 
current
research
aims
at
collecting
more
data
without
considering
already
existing
historical
and 
governmental
datasets
and
without
considering
the
people
behind
the
datasets.
This
paper 
proposes
a
framework
to
join
datasets
from
the
Alaska
Retrofit
Information
System
(ARIS) 
database
on
energy-retrofit
residences,
along
with
data
extracted
from
GEE,
by
ethically 
considering
each
variable
as
an
affected
individual
and
its
future
ramifications.
The
authors
of
this 
paper
hope
to
bring
insights
into
future
research
addressing
the
problem
with
existing
Alaska 
energy
datasets
and,
therefore,
contribute
to
the
field
of
energy
analytics
and
resource 
management.
3
Framework
The
proposed
framework
(Figure
1)
was
developed
with
the
primary
objective
of
joining 
administrative
survey
data
to
geospatial
building
data
in
an
ethical
manner,
wherein
exact
building 
locations
are
not
used
for
the
joins.
Table
1
(Appendix
A)
provides
a
description
of
the
ARIS 
Housing
datasets
and
the
cleaning
they
underwent,
including
the
removal
of
identical
duplicates 
and
addressing
out-of-range
values,
with
‘YearBuilt’
missing
values
imputed
using
iterative 
regression
and
K-Nearest
Neighbor
(KNN)
approaches.
Separately,
Table
2
(Appendix
A) 
describes
the
USA
Structures
dataset.
In
steps
1,
2
and
3
of
Figure
1,various
geospatial
datasets 
were
combined
to
estimate
the
base
area,
height
and
age
of
each
building
footprint
in
the
USA 
Structures
data.
The
process
of
height
estimation
gave
rise
to
negative
height
values
for
around
8% 
of
buildings
which
further
had
to
be
replaced
by
imputed
values
from
the
distribution
of
heights 
for
the
remaining
buildings.
In
step
4,
zip
codes
and
borough
information
was
added
to
the
USA 
Structures
dataset.
This
was
followed
by
KMeans
clustering
based
on
building
features
(area, 
height
and
age)
within
each
Alaskan
borough
(step
5).
The
Calinski-Harabasz
index
and
Silhouette 
scores
helped
determine
the
optimal
number
of
clusters
and
each
building
in
a
borough
was 
assigned
a
cluster
ID.
In
step
6,
the
cluster
ID
was
treated
as
an
output
variable
and
a
decision
tree 
was
fitted
using
building
area,
height
and
age
as
features,
for
each
borough.
Subsequently
in
step 
7,
the
ARIS
data
set
of
home
energy
audits
was
cleaned
and
the
same
set
of
building
features 
(area,
height
and
age)
along
with
energy
consumption
and
zip
codes
were
obtained
from
it.
In
step 
8,
clusters
were
predicted
for
each
building
in
ARIS
using
the
model
estimated
for
its
borough
in 
step
6.
For
ARIS
buildings,
a
building’s
borough
was
obtained
from
its
zip
code.
2
Steps
9,
10
and
11
describe
how
every
building
in
ARIS
was
matched
to
the
most
similar
building 
in
its
zip
code
from
USA
Structures
based
on
Euclidean
distances
(cosine
similarity
and 
Manhattan
distance
were
among
the
other
distance
metrics
computed)
between
vectors
of
building 
features
(area,
height
and
age)
for
every
pair
of
buildings.
This
process
was
repeated
for
every 
building
in
each
borough.
In
the
absence
of
exact
building
location
data,
the
clusters
and
zip
codes
served
as
filters
to
reduce 
the
search
space
for
a
building’s
match
and
make
the
matching
process
more
efficient.
The
clusters 
represent
how
similar
buildings
are
in
their
characteristics,
conditional
on
belonging
to
the
same 
zip
code.
Clustering
was
done
at
the
borough
level
because
a
borough
is
a
large
enough 
geographical
boundary
that
has
a
sufficient
number
of
buildings
of
various
types.
Filtering 
buildings
by
borough
was
equivalent
to
conditioning
on
approximate
location
which
made
our 
matches
more
accurate
without
sacrificing
too
much
statistical
power.
Further,
buildings
within 
boroughs
roughly
experience
similar
climates
which
will
become
more
relevant
when
we
predict 
energy
needs
of
buildings
based
on
changes
in
climate
in
the
future.

Results
and
Validation
The
framework
explained
in
the
previous
section
was
applied
to
each
borough
in
Alaska.
In
the 
results
presented
here,
the
matching
of
buildings
is
based
on
the
Euclidean
distance
metric 
between
vectors
of
building
characteristics
(area,
height,
age)
from
the
two
data
sets.
Validating 
our
matching
approach
can
prove
to
be
a
challenge
due
to
limited
data
on
building
characteristics 
for
the
whole
of
Alaska.
Further,
given
that
most
of
such
data
are
de-identified
in
terms
of 
geolocation,
we
can
only
use
aggregate
distributions
of
building
features
to
validate
our
matching 
framework.
One
approach
is
to
compare
the
distributions
of
building
features
from
ARIS
to
the 
corresponding
distributions
from
geospatial
data
in
the
final
matched
dataset.
The
matched
pairs
of 
features
from
each
dataset
can
be
plotted
in
the
same
graph.
The
specific
borough
presented
as
a
case
study
from
the
proposed
framework
is
the
Denali 
borough.
The
Denali
borough
has
a
total
of
590
buildings
spread
over
twelve
thousand
square 
miles.
Figure
2
shows
the
results
of
three
important
features
from
the
joins
made
on
the
Denali 
Borough.
Figure
2)b)
shows
the
closest
match
in
the
distribution
of
area
(in
square
feet)
for
all
the 
buildings
in
both
ARIS
and
USA
Structure
datasets.
This
indicates
that
the
framework
proposed
in 
this
paper
has
closely
matched
buildings
in
terms
of
base
area.
The
height
in
Figure
2)c)
has
the 
same
shape
between
the
USA
Structures
and
ARIS
density
plots.
This
again
indicates
that
the 
framework
is
working
and
suggests
measurement
errors
in
the
collection
of
the
datasets.
Figure
2:
Denali
Borough,
AK
showing
age
(a),
area
(b)
and
height
(c)
distributions.
The
age
of
buildings
is
an
important
feature
when
considering
future
heating
loads
models,
and 
unfortunately,
it
was
a
feature
poorly
recorded
in
both
datasets.
Figure
2)a)
shows
the
age
of
the 
buildings
having
dissimilar
densities.
The
ARIS
recorded
heights
show
a
multimodal
density
plot, 
which
would
indicate
that
this
data
was
recorded
for
different
groups
of
buildings
or
at
different 
times.
This
makes
sense,
given
the
nature
of
the
ARIS
dataset.
For
the
USA
structures,
the
density 
plot
shows
a
high
peak,
indicating
a
high
number
of
buildings
built
around
the
mean
age
reported. 
For
the
ARIS
dataset,
3%
of
the
observations
in
the
‘YearBuilt’
variable
had
missing
values, 
which
were
imputed
using
a
KNN
approach;
this
justifies
the
variability
of
its
density
plot.
For
the 
USA
structure
dataset,
missing
building
ages
were
assigned
a
specific
pre-agreed
value
based
on 
the
nature
of
the
geospatial
data
set
being
used
to
obtain
ages.
In
the
future,
we
intend
to
incorporate
the
BlocPower
[43]
and
Model
America
[44]
datasets
for 
validating
our
building
matches
and
energy
demand
estimates.
These
datasets
have
been
recently 
released
for
research
purposes
and
include
precise
building
location
data.
However,
through
this 
process,
we
also
intend
to
highlight
the
tradeoffs
between
accuracy
in
estimation
and
using 
sensitive
features
like
location
in
estimation.
The
ultimate
goal
behind
our
ethical
framework
is
to 
show
how
close
we
can
get
to
true
energy
demand
values
without
utilizing
sensitive
information 
like
exact
locations
and
compromising
on
privacy.
4
Our
final
dataset
consists
of
buildings
across
the
state
of
Alaska
with
their
corresponding
annual 
and
hourly
energy
demands.
This
can
be
used
to
inform
current
policies
aimed
at
improving
the 
energy
efficiency
of
buildings
in
the
state.
For
instance,
our
data
can
quantify
the
tradeoff
between 
retrofitting
households
and
replacing
old
construction
by
giving
approximate
energy
costs
in
both 
scenarios
and
facilitate
an
economically
efficient
decision.
5
Conclusions
and
Discussions
This
paper
delves
into
the
distinctive
energy
challenges
faced
by
Alaska
due
to
its
remote 
geographical
positioning
and
severe
climate
conditions,
all
while
emphasizing
the
inadequacy
of 
comprehensive
building
energy
data.
Within
this
context,
it
introduces
a
rigorous
ethical 
framework
designed
to
facilitate
the
large-scale
integration
of
data
-
with
the
help
of
machine 
learning
and
geospatial
techniques
-
for
the
purpose
of
mapping
energy
consumption
data
at
the 
individual
building
level,
drawing
from
both
the
Alaska
Retrofit
Information
System
(ARIS)
and 
the
USA
Structures
dataset.
The
contributions
of
this
research
encompass
the
identification
and 
acknowledgment
of
limitations
inherent
to
existing
datasets,
as
well
as
the
formulation
and 
establishment
of
a
robust
ethical
data
integration
framework.
This
approach
sets
a
precedent
for 
the
responsible
utilization
of
data
within
the
realm
of
climate
justice
research,
ultimately
serving 
to
inform
the
development
of
sustainable
energy
policies
through
enhanced
comprehension
of 
building
data
and
the
progression
of
ongoing
research
considerations.
Future
endeavors
will 
expand
upon
this
framework
by
incorporating
the
BlocPower
[43]
and
Model
America
[44] 
datasets,
recently
released
for
research
purposes,
which
include
precise
building
location
data. 
These
datasets
will
help
us
validate
our
proposed
ethical
framework
and
our
energy
demand 
estimates.
Most
importantly,
such
an
expansion
would
advance
ethical
considerations
pertaining
to 
sensitive
features,
thereby
representing
a
significant
stride
toward
addressing
Alaska's
intricate 
energy
challenges.

Data
Description
Table
1
shows
the
datasets
within
the
ARIS
Housing
data
used.
There
were
several
considerations 
taken
when
cleaning
these
datasets,
which
are
essential
to
note.
Due
to
the
possibility
of
the
same 
building
being
surveyed
more
than
once
and
in
order
to
retain
building
characteristics
for
each 
building,
identical
duplicates
were
dropped
from
the
dataset.
Several
variables
in
ARIS
had
values 
outside
the
plausible
range
(e.g.,
the
‘YearBuilt’
had
values
greater
than
the
current
year); 
therefore,
these
values
were
removed
and
treated
as
missing
values.
YearBuilt
is
an
important 
feature
for
future
models
but
had
2.5%
missing
values;
thereby,
the
missing
values
were
imputed 
using
an
iterative
regression
approach
as
well
as
a
K-Nearest
Neighbor
(KNN)
approach.

Table
2
shows
the
datasets
and
processes
taken
to
calculate
the
building’s
height,
area,
and
age. 
Once
these
calculations
were
done
separately,
the
data
was
merged
into
one
complete
dataset. 
Features
with
more
than
90%
missing
values
were
dropped.
Approximately
8%
of
buildings
in
the 
data
had
negative
height
values
due
to
imprecision
in
the
GEE
height
calculation.
Their
heights 
were
imputed
(and
replaced)
by
height
values
following
the
distribution
of
height
values
from
the 
rest
of
the

was
not
possible,
the
building
age
was
assigned 
to
1985.
A
single
dataset
with
building
age
estimates
was 
created
for
each
footprint
in
the
state
of
Alaska.

data
Iterate
over
each
zip
code,
calculating
the
height
of 
buildings
by
reducing
the
building
height
image
over
the 
filtered
building
collection
in
each
zip
code
to
compute
the 
average
building
height.
Calculate
the
area
of
each
building 
and
add
it
as
a
feature
to
the
dataset.
Combine
the
distinct 
zip
codes
into
one
feature
collection
and
export
this
singular 
dataset.
