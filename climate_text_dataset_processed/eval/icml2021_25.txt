Automated Identiﬁcation of Climate Risk Disclosures in Annual Corporate
Reports

Abstract
It is important for policymakers to understand
which ﬁnancial policies are effective in increasing
climate risk disclosure in corporate reporting. We
use machine learning to automatically identify dis-
closures of ﬁve different types of climate-related
risks. For this purpose, we have created a dataset
of over 120 manually-annotated annual reports
by European ﬁrms. Applying our approach to
reporting of 337 ﬁrms over the last 20 years, we
ﬁnd that risk disclosure is increasing. Disclosure
of transition risks grows more dynamically than
physical risks, and there are marked differences
across industries. Country-speciﬁc dynamics indi-
cate that regulatory environments potentially have
an important role to play for increasing disclosure.
1. Introduction
Climate-related ﬁnancial disclosures aim at increasing the
transparency to guide investment and lending decisions in
the ﬁnancial sector. They reﬂect not only the physical ef-
fects of a changing climate, also the transition processes
to decarbonize the economy that bear ﬁnancial risks and
opportunities. Such transition risks and opportunities in-
clude policy and legal change, technology and market shifts,
and reputation-related risks ( ClimateWise ,2019 ;Semieniuk
et al. ,2020 ). Transition risks are found to be more immi-
nent than physical risks from climate change, and there are
indications that some of those risks are already ﬁnancially
priced ( K¨olbel et al. ,2020 ). In fact, the G20 Financial Sta-
bility Board has established a Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to issue recommendations for
disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities (CRO)

ICML 2021.in corporate reporting ( TCFD ,2019 ). However, recent anal-
yses of the current standard of reporting have found insufﬁ-
cient clarity of CRO reporting (meaning that disclosures are
not speciﬁc enough to allow a judgement whether CRO are
material, i.e. signiﬁcant, for future ﬁnancial performance),
with some recent improvements ( TCFD ,2019 ;Climate Dis-
closure Standards Board (CDSB) ,2020 ;Demaria & Rigot ,
2019 ). To establish more stringent reporting standards on
CRO, policy makers and ﬁnancial regulators have begun
establishing regulations ( Steffen ,2021 ), for example the
2014 EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (EU directive
2014/95/EU) and subsequent guidelines (2017/C 215/01 and
2019/C 209/01) ( EUR-Lex ), Art. 173 of the French Energy
Transitions law from 2015 ( French Republic ,2015 ), and a
recent Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk
in the US ( The White House ,2021 ).
To monitor the state of climate-related disclosure and es-
tablish the effectiveness of related regulation, ﬁnancial re-
ports need to be analyzed to assess the extent and quality
of such disclosures by companies and organizations. Typi-
cally, these analyses are conducted manually, which is time-
intensive: recent examples covered only the 40 ( Demaria
& Rigot ,2019 ) and 50 largest companies ( Climate Disclo-
sure Standards Board (CDSB) ,2020 ) of different listings.
Constraining the analysis to only a small set of the largest
companies risks introducing bias or preventing important
insights: ﬁrst, the ﬁnancially strongest companies might not
sufﬁciently represent sectors that are most relevant for low-
carbon transitions (e.g., most freight shipping companies are
typically very small, while having a signiﬁcant carbon foot-
print ( Teter et al. ,2017 )). Second, there are equity concerns
if CROs of smaller companies are not monitored (e.g., they
could experience signiﬁcant transition-related opportunities
but investments are not directed to them). This bias might
cause the ﬁnancial impacts of climate change and transitions
to be incorrectly priced, and result in an inefﬁcient alloca-
tion of capital during the low-carbon transition ( Semieniuk
et al.,2020 ).
2. Problem Statement and Related Work
Recent work has shown ﬁrst successful computerized anal-
ysis of climate-related ﬁnancial disclosures. For example,Climate risk disclosure in annual reports
the TCFD has conducted an “AI review,” using a supervised
learning approach that is not further detailed. They identi-
ﬁed compliance with the TCFD Recommended Disclosures,
but did not assess the quality of the disclosed information
nor the type of risk ( TCFD ,2019 ). This approach was re-
ﬁned by Luccioni et al. (2020 ), who developed a question an-
swering approach to identify passages in climate disclosures
that answer the 14 TCFD recommendations, and make their
trained model accessible as a tool for sustainability analysts.
Bingler et al. (2021 ) developed “ClimateBERT” to analyze
compliance with TCFD recommendations in a variety of
corporate reporting globally, and ﬁnd mostly disclosure of
non-material TCFD categories. K¨olbel et al. (2020 ) were
able to identify an increase in disclosure of transition risks
in 10-K reports that outpaced those of physical risks, based
on their measure of climate disclosure using a ﬁne-tuned
BERT model. Finally, Sautner et al. (2020 ) use a rule-based
approach for identifying CRO-related language in corporate
conference calls. They use machine learning (ML) for ex-
panding their set of keywords, which was also proposed by
Luccioni & Palacios (2019 ) for analyzing climate-related
disclosure.
All of these studies have analyzed the number of mentions of
climate-related disclosures, however, the quality and materi-
ality of the disclosures remains largely unclear. Analyzing
the types of reported risks is a step into this direction, al-
lowing potential investors to better judge the materiality of
reported risks. We expand on K¨olbel et al. (2020 ) by intro-
ducing more ﬁne-grained risk categories and detect them in
free text such as European annual reports (instead of 10-Ks).
While most previous work has taken the approach to classify
at the sentence level, we observe that more context is needed
for disclosing risks, and we classify at the paragraph-level.
To carry out our project, we create a novel dataset based on
a reﬁned labeling scheme to distinguish different types of
climate-related risks (Section 3). We then train different clas-
siﬁcation algorithms to identify and categorize paragraphs
in free-text annual reports that disclose such climate-related
risks (Section 4). Finally, we apply the model to analyze
climate-related disclosure in annual reports of 337 European
ﬁrms over the past decade (Section 5).
3. Data
We created our own labeled dataset for the task of classifying
paragraphs according to disclosure of climate risks.1We
built a corpus of annual reports from the 50 largest publicly
traded companies (STOXX Europe 50) and more than half
of the European ﬁrms in the STOXX Europe 600 index for
the last 20 years (where available), which we obtained from
the companies’ investors relation websites and Reﬁnitiv
1Available upon request.Eikon ( Reﬁnitiv Eikon ,2021 ).We then parsed the PDF ﬁles
using the Apache Tika package2and split the documents
on each page into paragraphs using a rule-based approach
(regex).
The paragraphs were annotated by student assistants famil-
iar with climate policy, who were trained by the authors
and followed our code book (see Appendix). The ﬁve risk
categories include two types of physical risks and three
types of transitions risks. “Acute” and “chronic” physi-
cal risks denote those from increases in extreme weather
events and those that develop slowly like changes in pre-
cipitation patterns, respectively. Transition risks include
those related to the potential introduction or strengthening
of climate policies (“policy & legal”), to changing market
and technological environments (“tech. & market”), and to
the reputation of corporations or products (“reputation”).
For the test and validation datasets, we labeled 120 STOXX
Europe 50 reports in their entirety. We sampled stratiﬁed
by years and industries in order to avoid bias in the dataset
and later evaluate the model performance across industries
and time. To reduce the number of pages to screen, we
pre-selected those pages that included at least one match
with an extensive list of relevant keywords (see Appendix),
and their neighboring pages. On average, a report consisted
of 34 relevant pages with 16 paragraphs each. All para-
graphs on those selected pages were then annotated with
the ﬁve categories allowing multiple labels per paragraph.
Paragraphs without risk disclosure on relevant pages were
considered “negative examples”, and perceived edge cases
were labeled as “hard negatives.” We randomly split the
dataset in test and validation data, and ensured that each
contains a separate set of companies to avoid spill-overs.
The classes are highly imbalanced, which is why we em-
ployed a greedier approach for the training dataset focused
on covering the variance among positive examples and in-
cluding only hard negative examples. We extracted relevant
pages from annual reports of STOXX Europe 600 companies
using a more tailored keyword list than for the test dataset,
and then selectively labeled relevant paragraphs.
The resulting datasets are summarized in Table 1 . To assess
the inter-coder reliability, two coders independently labeled
20 reports resulting in a Krippendorff’s alpha of ↵=0.20
(union) and ↵=0.69(intersection) for 5 classes.
4. Methods
4.1. Tasks and Models
We divide the task of classifying climate risks in three tasks
of increasing difﬁculty: Binary (classiﬁcation in “risk” or
“no risk”), and multi-label with two(physical and transi-

tion risks) and ﬁve classes (all risk categories). On all of
these tasks we evaluate a baseline model, pretrained Distil-
BERT ( Sanh et al. ,2019 ), and RoBERTa ( Liu et al. ,2019 ).
As a baseline model, we selected a support vector machine
(SVM) ( Cortes & Vapnik ,1995 ) as a one-versus-rest classi-
ﬁer and applied standard preprocessing to the input such as
stop-word removal, lemmatization and TF-IDF weighting.
We addressed class imbalances between negatives and posi-
tives with class weights and used Precision-Recall AuC on
the validation set for scoring.
To leverage context-speciﬁc word embeddings, we ﬁne-
tuned different variants of pretrained BERT-related models
(Devlin et al. ,2019 ) such as DistilBERT ( Sanh et al. ,2019 )
and RoBERTa Large ( Liu et al. ,2019 ) on our training dataset
using negative log-likelihood loss with a softmax activation
function for binary classiﬁcation and a binary cross-entropy
loss for the multi-label classiﬁcation tasks. Again, we cal-
culated class weights to address the class-imbalance. We
trained the models for 4 epochs, using early stopping and
limited hyperparameter search on the validation set. We
also determined the optimal class probability thresholds by
maximizing the F1-score on the validation set. Training is
estimated to have emitted less than 7.12kgCO 2ein total.
4.2. Experiments and Validation
We evaluate the models on the three tasks deﬁned above as
well as in the following settings: (1) discriminatory where
no negative paragraphs are present, (2) hard negatives set-
ting with paragraphs that are edge cases, and (3) realistic set-
ting with all negatives from pre-selected pages. We choose
the best model for inference based on the F1-score on the
validation set for the realistic setting and ﬁve risk categories.
RoBERTa achieves the best performance in the 5-
class/realistic setting (Table 2). As RoBERTa is the largest
among the models compared, this conﬁrms expectations.Table 2. Validation performance (F1-score macro-avg.)

Notably, DistillBERT performs slightly better in the 2-
class/realistic setting, which could indicate that with more
training examples it might be sufﬁcient to rely on a smaller
model. Comparing across settings, the realistic case appears
the most difﬁcult, and the models perform best on the the
discriminatory case (without negatives). Remarkably, SVM
outperforms RoBERTa in the easiest setting. We also added
additional negative training examples in the realistic setting,
which did not improve performance.
4.3. Test Results
We evaluate the model performance on held-out test data in
the realistic setting (Table 3). In general, the model suffers
from a relatively low recall of 0.360, and its precision does
not exceed 0.5. This is explained by the fact that the task
of identifying disclosures requires domain expertise and
is also rather difﬁcult for humans. For comparison, after
reﬁning the coding scheme, we conducted a review of test
and validation data, resulting in a precision of 0.59for the
preliminary coding of binary , which is lower than what the
model achieves on the same task. We ﬁnd a large variance
in performance across classes, with reputational transition
risks being the hardest to identify (F1-score of 0.140) and
acute physical risks the easiest (F1-score of 0.537). We
also observe that physical risk classes exhibit a considerably
higher precision and lower recall than transition risk classes,
which are more balanced.
5. Applying the Model
We determined the number of risk mentions for 4,498 annual
reports by all 337 companies in the dataset by performing
inference on pages in proximity of a keyword match. Out of
2.7m analyzed paragraphs, 3892 paragraphs were predicted
to contain at least one risk (total of 5501 risk mentions).
Figure 1(a)shows the average number of mentions per report
of physical and transition risks over time, which grew slowly
until 2015, after which it increased rapidly. This growth
is particularly high for transition risks, resulting in aboutClimate risk disclosure in annual reports

three times as many mentions compared to physical risks
in 2019. The analysis of risk subcategories (Figure 1(b))
reveals that the growth was mainly driven by “policy &
legal” and “reputation” risks.
Given different regulatory environments, we compare the dy-
namics in four countries in Figure 2. Companies in France,
which has a disclosure mandate, and the United Kingdom
saw a marked rise in both transition and physical risk report-
ing since 2015, while Germany and Switzerland exhibited
a lower (but still clearly visible) growth during the same
period. Comparing different industries (Figure 3), we ﬁnd
that especially the energy, basic materials, and utilities in-
dustries disclose transition risks. These are sectors with
high emission intensities, which are particularly affected by
climate policies. For physical climate risk, no clear industry
pattern is visible in our data.

6. Discussion and Conclusion
In the present article, we developed an approach to au-
tomatically identify climate risk disclosures in corporate
annual reports, and used it to analyze disclosure of 337
European companies over 20 years. We ﬁnd that the num-
ber of risk mentions (especially of transition risks) started
to rise sharply around 2015. It appears likely that public
policies played a role for this development, as numerous

policies to encourage or mandate climate risk reporting
have been enacted in Europe since 2015 ( Steffen ,2021 ). To
assess whether speciﬁc policies indeed caused the devel-
opment, however, requires further research. Potential em-
pirical designs to that end include difference-in-differences
approaches, or models with country- and industry-ﬁxed
effects. Our approach is well suited to the deliver the depen-
dent variable for such analysis.
Next steps for reﬁning our analysis will focus on appro-
priately quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions,
and working to reduce it further by exploring a hierarchical
classiﬁcation approach, and adding more training data. The
analysis can also be expanded to a broader set of company
types and communication channels beyond annual reports.
Finally, it should be kept in mind that improved transparency
on climate risks should not automatically be expected to
change investor behavior in a meaningful way ( Ameli et al. ,
2020 ). More research is needed to understand how capital is
(re)allocated based on better climate risk disclosures; in this
context our approach can be useful to deliver the explana-Climate risk disclosure in annual reports
tory variable for such future analyses. Ultimately, both the
effectiveness of policies to trigger climate risk disclosures,
and the effectiveness of such disclosures to change invest-
ment behavior, are required for ﬁnancial investments to help
achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement.

1. Coding scheme
Physical Risk : Risks from the physical impacts of climate-change. Note: Include also “indirect” physical risks, i.e. when
climate change is not mentioned directly but reference to one of physical effects from climate change (second order effects).

•Chronic: Risks from changes in precipitation patterns (droughts), rising mean temperatures, rising sea levels.
Transition Risk : Description of risks from the transition to a lower-carbon economy.
•Policy & Legal: Risks related to the potential introduction or strengthening of climate policies, such as carbon tax,
emission reporting policy changes, regulation on products and services, litigation risk (i.e. climate-related lawsuits).
