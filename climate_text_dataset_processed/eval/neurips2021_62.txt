Abstract
Carbon capture and sequestration are viewed as an indispensable component to
achieve the Paris Agreement climate goal, i.e, keep the global warming within 2
degrees celsius from pre-industrial levels. Once captured, most CO 2needs to be
stored securely for at least decades, preferably in deep underground geological
formations. It is economic to inject and store CO 2near/around a depleted gas/oil
reservoir or well, where a geological trap for CO 2with good sealing properties
and some minimum infrastructure exist. In this proposal, with our preliminary
work, it is shown that Machine Learning tools like Optical Character Recognition
and Natural Language Processing can aid in screening and selection of injection
sites for CO 2storage, facilitate identiﬁcation of possible CO 2leakage paths in
the subsurface, and assist in locating a depleted gas/oil well suitable for CO 2
injection and long term storage. The automated process based on ML tools can
also drastically decrease the decision making cycle time in the site selection and
assessment phase by reducing human effort. In the longer term, we expect ML
tools like Deep Neural Network can also be utilized in CO 2storage monitoring,
injection optimization etc. By injecting CO 2into a trapping geological underground
formation in a safe and sustainable manner, the oil and gas industry can contribute
substantially in reducing global warming and achieving the goals of the Paris
Agreement by the end of this century.
1 Introduction
According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report [ 1] , 14 percent
of the global greenhouse gas emissions reductions needed by 2050 can be achieved through carbon
capture. Speciﬁcally in the industrial sector (fuel burning power plants, Oil & Gas reﬁnery, etc.),
carbon capture is the only viable way to achieve full decarbonization. Various carbon capture
technology (physical, membrane and Cryogenic, etc.) are under active development [ 2]. Once
captured, the carbon dioxide can be put to productive use in enhanced oil recovery, manufacturing
fuels, and building materials in limited quantities. Most of captured CO 2will have to be stored in
underground geological formations such as a structural trap.
As shown in Fig. 1, the geological structure trapping mechanism is exactly the same as for gas and
oil reservoirs. Therefore, the oil & gas industry is well positioned to handle this CO 2sequestration
challenge, based on years of experience in hydrocarbon exploration/extraction/injection from various
underground geological formations (oil/gas trapping). With the possibility of implementation of
carbon tax regulations in the near term, the economic incentives for the oil and gas industry to work
on carbon sequestration projects will increase.

Carbon sequestration is generally separated into four pillars: Capacity, Transport & Injection,
Containment, and ﬁnally Monitoring & Corrective Measures. Capacity is the very ﬁrst step which
evaluates the storage capacity at a certain sequestration site, depending primarily on the geological
formation at the sequestration site. Five types of underground formations for geologic carbon storage
are currently under active investigation: saline formations, oil and natural gas reservoirs, un-mineable
coal seams, organic-rich shales, and basalt formations [ 3]. Among these options, depleted oil/gas
reservoir is the most economically viable sites to store CO 2, provided the depleted reservoirs have
suitable properties: a geological trap with good seal to avoid leakage in long term. Therefore,
choosing a proper site for carbon storage is crucial in realizing both the near and long term goal of
carbon sequestration. To do this, geologists have to manually read through hundreds (sometimes
thousands) of drilling & completion reports, and abandonment status reports (some can be dated back
to late 1930s and written by hand) and extract relevant information in the Region of Interest (ROI),
then summarize and synthesize all the ﬁndings and evaluate the over-all quality of storage potential
for each CO 2injection site. Then an estimation of potential storage capacity can be made for this
ROI, followed by a feasibility study and decision to either further develop the ROI or abandon it if it
is not practical.
Machine Learning (ML) technologies like Boosted Decision Tree [ 4], and Deep Neural Network
(DNN) [ 5] have been used in various O&G applications, such as rock type determination [ 6,7],
geophysical work ﬂows like well tie [ 8] or salt picking [ 9], reservoir property analysis [ 10], and
ﬁeld offset well pressure data analysis [ 11]. In this study, we propose to apply Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) [ 12] and Natural Language Processing (NLP) [ 13] ML tools to the carbon
sequestration problem, speciﬁcally, in the sequestration site assessment process. The goal for
OCR is to automate the reading process for hundreds of well reports, and automatically extract
textual information from those well logs. Following this, NLP will be used to tokenize and extract
relevant informations like abundant status, casing, cementing and plug information. Together with
geological and geo-mechanical criteria obtained from Subject Matter Experts (SME), an automatic
feasibility matrix of ﬁeld development can be made by these ML tools. In short, the goal is to
develop an automatic recommendation system with the help of ML to facilitate site selection and
ﬁeld development of CO 2sequestration.
2 Preliminary Work
The process of injection site assessment for CO 2storage requires a variety of information to be
collected, analyzed and synthesized a priori. This normally includes daily drilling reports, mud
log, completion reports, scout reports, etc. Formats of these ﬁles can include png images, pdfs, csv,
data base output, excel spreadsheet, etc. For standard csv, pdf, and spreadsheet formats, we use
the standard python packages to read the information in. However, old hand-written or typewriter
typed reports (some that date back to 1930s) scanned to images and pdfs can be challenging to
2extract information. To this end, we utilize the state of art google Tesseract 4.1.1 OCR engine [ 12] to
automatically recognize English and number characters in various well logs & reports. Keywords
ﬁltering is then applied to these outputs to locate the matches to an expected list of words generated
by SMEs. Some example key words are "cemented", "casing", and "abandoned". These are important
because if we see such words in a well report, it’s highly indicative the well is probably a depleted
gas or oil ﬁeld, thus a possible candidate for CO 2sequestration. Some other keywords like "porosity"
and "permeability" will also be critical as they are related to rock properties which are very necessary
to evaluate the geological trapping capacity and top-seal effectiveness.
As a pilot test, we developed a preliminary tool which converts scanned images (in PDF format)
to Python Imaging Library (PIL) images, while each PIL image represents one page of the PDF
document.The PIL image is then fed to the Tesseract OCR engine through pytesseract interface.
OCR returns the recognized words line by line. Keyword ﬁltering is applied here to keep only the
line containing at least one of the expected keywords. Input PDF ﬁle name, page number are also
tracked and ﬁnally are put into a pandas DataFrame together with identiﬁed strings. This allows
SME to quickly know which ﬁle and where the keyword is located, so that a quick quality check and
validation can be performed.
During the pilot test, we gathered 122 well log/drilling report ﬁles from a region of interest in a
North American ﬁeld. These well reports have been studied by SMEs for quite some time and all the
keywords in these ﬁles have been thoroughly identiﬁed and validated by SMEs. The scanned ﬁles
also include 34 ﬁles which contain hand-written words, which are harder for OCR to recognize. An
example image is shown in Fig. 2, where both typewriter typed words and hand-written words are
present in a year 1959 report.
Figure 2: A small part of an input well log scanned image, with both typewriter typed words and
hand-written words.
For the example in Fig. 2, the tool correctly identiﬁed the key word Casing and its corresponding
contextual information: casing size value 8"1580.
In total, the tool was able to locate keywords in 61 ﬁles. Among those 34 ﬁles containing hand-written
words, the tool was able to identify 13 of them containing desired keywords. The rest 70 ﬁles
indeed did not contain any keywords as also conﬁrmed by the SMEs. The overall successful key
words identiﬁcation rate is 80% as reported by the SMEs who have the correct keyword list, which
the tool never has access to. This result is rather encouraging, because it only took 10 minutes to
identify these many keywords by the tool, compared to days of work by SMEs to read through these
ﬁles page by page, ﬁle by ﬁle.
3 Proposed Future Work
Based on the encouraging pilot result, we proposed to do the following in the immediate near future:
3.1 Accuracy Improvement on Keyword Identiﬁcation
This will be important especially for old hand-written reports. We will preprocess OCR image input
to recognize more hand-written words, Techniques like Binarisation, Image Inverting, Erosion and
Dilation will deﬁnitely be tested. We will also gather more variations of inputs. As retraining the OCR
3model from scratch is not feasible for this work, we can utilize transfer learning by only retraining
the top several layers of the neural network model with our limited training samples.
To recognize more keywords, we can also apply the standard NLP [ 13] processing ﬂows like
punctuation removing, tokenization, stopwords removal, and lemmatizing.
3.2 Geological Information for the Recommendation System
As mentioned in the introduction, our goal is to provide a system which recommends whether a ROI
is suitable for CO 2storage. Therefore, keywords identiﬁcation is only the ﬁrst step. Additionally, we
will need a text mining process to associate the numerical values to the identiﬁed keywords.
This is important as numerical value for certain keywords are always referred to a well and/or
geological related information, thus critical in CO 2trap assessment. For example, for keyword plug ,
the depth related information is important. If the plug is too shallow, meaning the reservoir is too
shallow (the depth is less than critical depth) to keep the CO 2in liquid state, which won’t be ideal for
CO2storage. As CO 2in gaseous state occupies a larger volume in the reservoir (see Fig. 3), this will
result in a diminished storage capacity for the sequestration site.
Figure 3: Pressure effect on CO 2, with increasing depth. Image is retrieved from DOE Carbon
Storage Program [3].
Numerical value extractions can be done using heuristics methods like regex and distance measure
to the keyword. For instance, in the Fig.. 2 example, we need to associate the 8"1580to possibly a
"casing size" attribute. Once value extraction is done, we can construct an overall recommendation
score for each storage site, based on available keyword information (well and geological information).
If the result is positive, a carbon sequestration site development decision might be made.
3.3 Tool Development for more Usability
We want to make the assessment process independent of how many opportunities/ROIs we have.
Ideally, this tool should allow screening ROIs in real time, so that we can make the CO 2storage
development decision faster. Currently, on average, it takes 6 months to identify a suitable CO 2
injection site. With the help of the proposed tool, we expect the site assessment process to be
completed in less than one month. To do this, we need to extend the preliminary tool to a docker
container, so anyone can run the tool easily with his/er own ROI input ﬁles. Furthermore, we can
deploy the container to cloud as a web-based application that enables screening multiple ROIs in
parallel, supported by a backend Kubernetes cluster, saving even more time for more SMEs.
OCR and NLP are the most critical parts of the proposed work, because they are the very ﬁrst steps
for information extraction. The extraction completeness directly determines how much data coverage
we can have as input to the recommendation logic. Therefore, OCR and NLP have the largest impact
to the accuracy and reliability of this recommendation tool.
44 Conclusion and Discussion
In this proposal, we demonstrated preliminary usage of ML tools like OCR and NLP in automating
the carbon sequestration site optimization process. It is evident that OCR and NLP can support the
currently human-interpretation-dominant decision making process to select a more objective site
for CO 2storage, to help identify possible leak paths in the CO 2storage trap under investigation, to
assist in locating a depleted oil/gas reservoir suitable for CO 2injection and long term storage. By
automating these tasks, ML tools can drastically decrease the time spent on site assessment, thus
enabling a faster implementation of the CO 2storage facility. In return, the proposed automated
workﬂow will enable us to decarbonize faster and in larger quantities.
In the longer term, we expect ML tools like deep neural network (DNN) can also be utilized in CO 2
storage monitoring, injection optimization etc. For example, it has been shown that ML is promising
in interpreting the ﬂow rate and pressure in oil reservoirs [ 10] through inversion from raw ﬁeld
measurements. We can apply similar methodology to monitor CO 2ﬂuid properties in the storage trap
to detect possible CO 2leaking back to the surface, and take proactive measures to ﬁx the leak.
By injecting CO 2into a suitable geological formation in a safe and sustainable manner, the O&G in-
dustry can contribute substantially in reducing the global warming and achieving the Paris Agreement
goal by the end of the century.
