Abstract
While photovoltaic (PV) systems are installed at an unprecedented rate, reliable
information on an installation level remains scarce. As a result, automatically
created PV registries are a timely contribution to optimize grid planning and
operations. This paper demonstrates how aerial imagery and three-dimensional
building data can be combined to create an address-level PV registry, specifying
area, tilt, and orientation angles. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of this approach
for PV capacity estimation. In addition, this work presents, for the ﬁrst time, a
comparison between automated and ofﬁcially-created PV registries. Our results
indicate that our enriched automated registry proves to be useful to validate, update,
and complement ofﬁcial registries.
1 Introduction and Related Work
Photovoltaics (PV) is a key technology to decarbonize our energy systems. Hence, knowing the
location, size, and orientation of existing PV systems is essential to predict PV electricity supply and
to support the planning and operation of electricity systems. However, keeping track of installed PV
systems is difﬁcult due to their decentralized character and large number.
Centralized PV registries are intended to keep track of PV system installations but have considerable
shortcomings. One approach to collect PV system data are self-reports, such as the Open PV
project [ 10] or Germany’s ofﬁcial PV registry [ 2], where owners are required to register their PV
system. Efforts for generating and maintaining these registries, however, are high and human data
entry is often error-prone. Furthermore, PV systems are mostly registered using street addresses
so that important information on the exact location of the systems, such as corresponding rooftops,
remain unknown. To address these shortcomings, a second type of registries has recently emerged,
which recollects PV system data in an automated fashion using aerial imagery and machine learning
[12,17,4,13]. An overview is provided in [ 6]. Yet, these approaches do not link detected PV systems
to their respective buildings. Hence, important information for power systems operation, such as tilt
angle, orientation angle, occupied rooftop area, as well as socio-economic information associated
with buildings and their owners remains unknown.
In this work, we ﬁrst propose an automated approach to generate an enriched PV registry with
additional information such as tilt angle, orientation, and general building data. For this purpose, we
combine aerial imagery with 3D building geometries. This enriched registry provides the basis for
several important applications, such as supply predictions, PV nowcasting, and estimation of available
rooftop capacities [ 6]. As a second contribution, we demonstrate how the tilt angle derived from
*Equal contribution.
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.3D building data allows for an improved PV generation capacity estimation. As a third contribution,
we compare our constructed registry to the German PV registry [ 2]—an ofﬁcial registry relying
on self-reported data. This has previously not been done [ 6]. We thereby identify non-reported
installations, erroneous locations, and duplicated entries. This shows that automated PV registries,
such as our approach, may be valuable for policy makers for improving ofﬁcial PV registries relying
on self-reported data.
2 Methodology
In Figure 1, we describe how aerial imagery and 3D building data are combined in order to create the
enriched PV registry with an automated processing pipeline. The pipeline consists of the following
steps.
Figure 1: Pipeline to create an automated PV registry.
Input. The processing pipeline uses aerial imagery and 3D building data as input.
Classiﬁcation. The classiﬁcation module detects whether or not a PV system is present in
an image. For classiﬁcation, we use a ﬁne-tuned model for Germany which is based on the DeepSolar
architecture [ 17], as described in Section 6.1. Only aerial images classiﬁed as depicting PV systems
are propagated to the segmentation module.
Semantic Segmentation. The segmentation module determines which areas are covered by
a PV system. We use the pre-trained DeepLabv3 CNN with a Resnet-101 backbone for semantic
segmentation [ 5]. The model is pre-trained on a subset of COCO Train 2017, i.e. the 20 categories
that are present in the Pascal VOC dataset. We ﬁne-tune DeepLabv3 for the task of PV system
segmentation from aerial imagery. The hyperparameters are set to the best values described in the
original work [5]. Training speciﬁcs and related information are described in Section 6.2.
PV Polygon and 3D Building Data. Rolling out the classiﬁcation and segmentation mod-
ules on a large scale, we obtain an instance-level PV system list containing the estimated shapes as
real world coordinate polygons. After intersecting the PV system polygons with the rooftop polygons,
we obtain PV polygons accurately mapped to the corresponding rooftops. Based on this result, we
calculate the area occupied by a PV system in m2and adjust this value by taking the tilt angle into
account. To compare the results with the ofﬁcial registry, we estimate the installation capacity by
assuming a factor of 6:5m2perkWh generation peak [7] with respect to our area estimates.
Automated Registry. Intersecting the PV system area estimates with rooftop polygons en-
ables us to create an automated registry. For each address associated with the rooftop data, we group
detected PV systems and aggregate the respective PV panel sizes and capacity estimates. We exclude
entries with a segmented PV installation area lower than 6 m2as these indicate processing errors, e.g.
minor overlaps of segmented PV installations with adjacent rooftops.
3 Data
Image Data. We gather high resolution aerial imagery with a native spatial resolution of around
0.1 meter per pixel provided by [ 15]. Each image contains 320320pixels and is downloaded
at an upsampled spatial resolution of 0.05 meter per pixel. The classiﬁcation dataset contains
107,809 images in total. Table 5 in the appendix provides an overview of the dataset. While the
validation and test set splits are drawn from North Rhine-Westphalia at random, the training set is
composed according to the dataset creation strategy described in [ 13] and further enriched with
difﬁcult-to-classify samples. The segmentation dataset consists of 4,028 images in total, which
2are randomly drawn from the positively classiﬁed locations in North Rhine-Westphalia provided
by [13]. The dataset is further enriched with samples depicting shadows, reﬂections, and other
difﬁcult-to-segment effects. The dataset split is described in Table 6 in the appendix.
3D Building Data. The 3D building data for North Rhine-Westphalia is downloaded from
[14]. It has been created by fusing LiDAR-based point clouds with other publicly available datasets
[9], e.g. building footprints. With a height estimation error of less than one meter, it provides highly
accurate information about each geometric feature of a building, e.g. wall, rooftop, and footprint
polygons. Our work focuses on rooftop polygons in order to extract a rooftop’s tilt and orientation
referring to [1] for calculation. Finally, each rooftop polygon is ﬂattened from 3D to 2D.
Ofﬁcial PV Registry. The German government provides an ofﬁcial registry of generation
units listing the address, generation capacity, and other related information ( ‘Marktstammdatenregis-
ter’). The public version only publishes accurate address information for PV installations larger than
30kWp .
4 Results
4.1 Classiﬁcation and Segmentation Performance
In Table 1 and Table 2, we compare our pipeline’s classiﬁcation and segmentation performance to the
state of the art.

Classiﬁcation. The classiﬁcation model achieves a precision of 87.3% and a recall of 87.5% on
the test set (for an imbalance rate of 7 and a threshold of 0.68). Without a benchmark dataset, our
classiﬁcation model appears to perform at a similar level as [17] but notably worse than [16].
Segmentation. The segmentation model for PV panel size estimation yields a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of 18.5% and an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 74.1% on the test set
(for a weight of 0.3 and a threshold of 0.5). In addition, we ﬁnd that our segmentation estimation is
unbiased since it underestimates the overall PV system area in the test set by only 3.9%. Without a
benchmark dataset, our segmentation model appears to perform better than [17] but worse than [8].
It must be noted that each of the related approaches uses different datasets and comparability is
therefore limited. Yet, the results indicate that our pipeline’s performance is in a similar range as the
current state of the art.
4.2 Improved PV Capacity Estimation with Rooftop Tilt Angles
To demonstrate the value of enriching the segmented PV systems with 3D building data, we show
how information on the rooftop tilt improves the estimation of PV system capacities. Overall, in
our study area, the roof surfaces that are equipped with PV systems are tilted between 0 (ﬂat roofs)
and 80 degrees. The majority is tilted between 10 and 15 degrees; however, there is considerable
variation. A histogram of the rooftop tilts is displayed in Figure 2 in the appendix. We now use 120
PV systems that are detected by our pipeline and compare their estimated capacities with the entries
in the ofﬁcial registry. Table 3 displays the results with and without the incorporation of rooftop
tilt angles. We ﬁnd a MedAPE of 25.9% when neglecting rooftop tilt. When incorporating it, the
error is considerably reduced to 16.1%. Overall, this demonstrates the rooftop tilt’s importance for
3PV capacity estimation and associated applications, such as PV supply predictions or nowcasting.
Furthermore, this analysis underlines the value of enriched PV registries as presented in this paper.

4.3 Comparison with Germany’s Ofﬁcial Registry
In total, we localize 1,211 PV systems in Bottrop, while Germany’s ofﬁcial PV registry lists around
1,509 PV systems. When comparing the ofﬁcially registered capacity with the estimated installation
capacity, the ofﬁcial registry yields 57,219kWp, while we identify 32,386kWp taking the tilt angle
into account. Using our automated register to analyze these signiﬁcant differences, we are able to
unveil the following discrepancies:
Duplicated entries. In total, 3.2% of the ofﬁcial registry’s entries turn out to be duplicates.
These duplicates potentially result from PV systems that are reported multiple times by their
owners or other errors during data collection.
Erroneous capacities. By comparing our capacity estimations with the registered capacities,
we notice entries with substantially inﬂated installation capacities.
Multiple entries per address. For some addresses, multiple PV systems are registered.
This may arise from the fact that each commissioning of a PV system is registered separately
in the ofﬁcial registry. While this is not an error per se, it may still be impractical for
analyses based on the registry.
After correcting for duplicates and inﬂated capacities, the ofﬁcial registry yields a total installation
capacity of 29,758 kWp , as summarized in Table 4. Hence, our pipeline overestimates the total
installation capacity by only 8.8%. By investigating further, we are able to identify additional
discrepancies. For this analysis, we consider only PV systems above 30kWp, which corresponds to
160 entries in the ofﬁcial registry:
False addresses. 24 out of 160 entries are listed with a false address in the ofﬁcial registry.
This issue arises particularly for larger PV systems, e.g. at industrial facilities, where the
address of the system owner is recorded instead of the address of the actual PV system
location.
Missing entries. Our pipeline identiﬁes 21 PV systems that are not listed in the ofﬁcial
registry.
Overall, these results demonstrate that the presented automated PV registry can help to improve PV
registries based on self-reported data. However, it must be noted that automated PV registries cannot
yet replace self-reported registers: 16 out of the 160 entries above 30kWp were not detected by our
pipeline or the capacity estimation failed.
5 Discussion and Outlook
Based on our results, we are conﬁdent that our approach can provide a good alternative to generate,
update, and enhance registries which rely on self-reporting. Furthermore, by providing detailed
information on PV installations, our approach enables improved solar generation modeling and
supports PV supply forecasting as well as nowcasting. This facilitates improved integration studies
for smart grid components such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure, additional PV capacity,
and grid reinforcements. It should be noted that our approach relies on the availability of up-to-date
aerial imagery and 3D building data which might not be readily available. Moreover, policy-relevant
information such as institutional ownership of PV systems cannot be directly obtained through our
approach but could be collected through other means such as automated web search.

6 Appendices
6.1 Training DeepSolar GER for PV system detection
We use the pre-trained DeepSolar network for PV system detection in Germany and train it for 25
epochs as described in [ 13]. We used a batch size of 8, an imbalance rate of 7, and an initial learning
rate of 0.0001. Training stops as soon as the binary cross-entropy does not decrease for 5 subsequent
epochs.
6.2 Training DeepLabv3 for PV system segmentation
Due to class imbalance, we use a weight factor to emphasize PV panel pixels in the binary
cross-entropy calculation. The result of the segmentation model is a 320320probability density
map indicating the likelihood that a certain pixel in the image depicts a PV system. The model
is trained for 25 epochs with a batch size of 10, however, training stops as soon as the binary
cross-entropy does not decrease for 10 subsequent epochs. To ﬁnd the estimated area covered by
PV systems in an image, we normalize the resulting segmentation map so all values lie in [0;1]and
search for the threshold at which the model yields the lowest MAPE on the validation set. The
obtained threshold is used for the test set and for inference for all images in North Rhine-Westphalia.
