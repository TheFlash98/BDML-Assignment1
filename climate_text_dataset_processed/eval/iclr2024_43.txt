ABSTRACT
Access to smart meter data is essential to rapid and successful transitions to elec-
trified grids, underpinned by flexibility delivered by low carbon technologies, such
as electric vehicles (EV) and heat pumps, and powered by renewable energy. Yet
little of this data is available for research and modelling purposes due consumer
privacy protections. Whilst many are calling for raw datasets to be unlocked
through regulatory changes, we believe this approach will take too long. Synthetic
data addresses these challenges directly by overcoming privacy issues. In this pa-
per, we present Faraday, a Variational Auto-encoder (V AE)-based model trained
over 300 million smart meter data readings from an energy supplier in the UK,
with information such as property type and low carbon technologies (LCTs) own-
ership. The model produces household-level synthetic load profiles conditioned
on these labels, and we compare its outputs against actual substation readings to
show how the model can be used for real-world applications by grid modellers
interested in modelling energy grids of the future.
1 I NTRODUCTION
A huge part of the global transition to net zero involves increasing the share of electricity from
renewable sources and concomitantly electrifying heating and transport. Given the variability of
renewables and growing adoption of low carbon technologies (LCTs), there are new challenges to
our electricity grid such as creating new demand peaks, grid constraints and mismatches between
demand and supply. Households with LCTs however can provide flexibility through automation to
solve these challenges (National Grid, 2021; Ofgem, 2021; Xilas, 2023; Cheesecake Energy Ltd.,
2022).
With access to granular household-level electricity consumption data, especially of households with
LCTs, we can build better bottom-up grid models of future energy systems to model scenarios, such
as varying frequencies of adverse weather conditions or different heat pump adoption rates to under-
stand grid resiliency, identify grid constraints, and plan for grid reinforcement projects (Damianakis
et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Many countries have rolled out smart meters to collect electricity
consumption at 15 or 30-minute intervals. Access to this data is limited due to privacy concerns. An
example of a smart meter data repository in the United Kingdom is the Smart Energy Research Lab
(Elam et al., 2023) which has a strict approval criteria. Calls to liberalise smart meter data for public
good (Energy Systems Catapult, 2023) are growing, but they too involve lengthy bureaucracy and
strict governance processes. Generating synthetic smart meter data circumnavigates these issues.
There is a growing number of literature (Zhang et al., 2019; Liang & Wang, 2022; Gu et al., 2019)
that have applied generative artificial intelligence technologies to create synthetic smart meter data.
Yet many of them are only theoretical and lack the ability to condition outputs on the type of LCTs
that households own. Understanding how different households with LCTs consume electricity is
important in modelling grid systems of the future.
In this paper, we present Faraday - a model trained using a combination of Variational Auto-encoder
and Gaussian Mixture Model. We demonstrate how it has been evaluated and tested in the real
world. The model is trained on a proprietary dataset of UK households with metadata on the type
of LCTs they own and as such is capable of conditioning outputs by this information. The model is

currently deployed live as a web-app and an API in closed-alpha phase, available to about 50 alpha
testers from academia and industry.
2 M ETHODOLOGY
2.1 A BOUT THE DATASET
We have access to proprietary data belonging to an energy supplier in the United Kingdom. The
dataset consists of metered half-hourly electricity consumption data of 20 thousand households in
2021 and 2022, alongside attributes such as the type of LCTs they own, the property type and the
property’s energy rating. The total number of smart meter readings in this dataset is in the excess of
300 million.
The access to this rich dataset means Faraday is able to generate household-level synthetic smart me-
ter profiles that are conditioned upon inputs that the user provides, such as whether the household
owns an electric vehicle (EV), their capacity to shift around consumption in response to grid con-
ditions (i.e. whether they have a smart tariff) and the type of property (e.g. bungalows, terraced or
flats). The model’s outputs are valuable to grid modellers who want to model future energy systems
that rely on low carbon technologies and renewable energy sources.
2.2 F ARADAY ARCHITECTURE
Figure 1: Faraday architectureFaraday is a model based on Conditional Vari-
ational Auto-encoder (V AE) (Sohn et al., 2015)
and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algo-
rithms. It works by first training a conditional
V AE. The training data is then mapped to the
latent space using the trained auto-encoder on
which a GMM is trained to learn the distribu-
tion of the latent space. During inference, a ran-
dom sample of latent vectors is drawn from the
GMM and decoded using the trained decoder.
To support conditional sampling, labels are ap-
pended to the latent codes when training the
GMM. During sampling, random samples are
drawn and labels that do not match the user’s
inputs are discarded.
2.2.1 M ODIFICATIONS TO VAE
A traditional V AE’s reparametrization layer uses a normal distribution via the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
Divergence loss to approximate the latent space. As smart meter data is non-normal and heavily
positively skewed, KL-Divergence loss is not ineffective for learning this distribution. Applying
log-normal transformation to the input data helps but comes at the cost of the fidelity at the higher
quantiles (the peak loads) which is an area of interest when it comes to grid modelling. Instead
of KL-Divergence loss, the Maximum Mean Divergence (MMD) loss is used in similar fashion to
InfoV AE (Zhao et al., 2018). In addition, quantile losses at 5th, 50thand 95thare added to the loss
function to help improve fidelity of synthetic outputs at various quantiles. The loss function used
is therefore the sum of: a. the reconstruction loss (mean-squared error), b. the MMD (instead of
KL-Divergence) loss and c. the three quantile losses.
2.2.2 G AUSSIAN SAMPLING OF LATENT SPACE
The latent space of a traditional V AE is modelled using a unimodal Gaussian distribution. However,
this is insufficient to capture the distribution of the latent space. To guarantee that the distribution of
the generated samples matches that of the real data, a large random sample of the training data was
drawn and encoded to the latent space with the trained encoder. A GMM is then trained to learn the
distribution of the latent space where the training data occupies. During inference, random samples
are drawn using the GMM and samples are decoded using the trained decoder. This is different to

the original GM-V AE (Aguilera et al., 2023) where the Gaussian Mixture Model replaces the prior
distribution of a unimodal Gaussian to learn the distribution of the latent space implicitly.
3 R ESULTS
In this section we analyse the outputs of Faraday through these three qualities Jordon et al. (2022):
1) Fidelity 2) Utility and 3) Privacy. We also compare the results to other GAN-based models for
utility and demonstrate that Faraday outputs were of higher utility than GAN-based outputs.

vehicle (EV).

Figure 4: Fidelity of Faraday outputs.
Fidelity refers to the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data. This can be done quan-
titatively by comparing the statistical metrics (such as mean and quantile values), or qualitatively
by comparing the distributions visually via t-stochastic neighbour embedding (TSNE) or principal
component analysis (PCA) plots (Yoon et al., 2019). Figures 2 and 4a show high fidelity of Fara-
day outputs except at the 5thquantile where synthetic data is clipped to a minimum of zero. More
tuning could be done to improve performance at the 5thquantile but comes at the expense of perfor-
mance at the 95thquantile. Due to grid modellers’ interest in studying peak loads, performance at
3Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
higher quantiles is prioritised over performance at lower quantiles. Figures 3a and 4b shows the load
profiles at various quantiles of households with or without electric vehicles whilst figure 4b shows
individual samples of load profiles.
3.2 U TILITY
Utility looks at how useful generated samples are in real life applications. In the RCGAN paper,
Esteban et al. (2017) proposes the “Train on Synthetic, Test on Real” (TSTR) framework where two
competing models for an evaluation task are trained: one on synthetic data and one on real data. The
intuition is that if the synthetic data is useful, then a model trained on synthetic data should perform
as well as the model trained with real data.
For this utility task, we used real 2021 consumption data to generate synthetic consumption profiles
for 2021. Two forecasting models are then trained, one on real 2021 data and one on synthetic 2021
data, to predict 2022 consumption. Figure 5a shows the performance of Faraday outputs is similar
to the forecasting model trained on real data. We also compared the utility of Faraday outputs
against other popular GAN-based models and show that Faraday outputs have higher utility in this
forecasting task.
Faraday outputs were also compared against real-world data measured at substations. Day & Wilson
(2023) used Faraday outputs in a digital twin project in Birmingham, UK, and compared Faraday
outputs to substation measured data and found strong alignment between the two. This was done
by collecting property information of houses served by the substation, inputting this information
into Faraday to produce household-level profiles and aggregating the profiles to the substation level.
Results show that Faraday outputs have similar peaks in terms of magnitude and time, but have
higher ‘base load’. This could be due to a skew in population between this dataset and the average
UK population (e.g. in terms of income and demographics etc).

tion measured data.

3.3 P RIVACY
Privacy refers to the risk of leaking private data because of the model overfitting on the training data.
By design, Faraday samples from a distribution to generate synthetic samples during inference and
its outputs are therefore ‘synthetic’. However, there could still be a risk of the distribution being
overfitted and thus leaking private data, especially in the case of outliers (van Breugel et al., 2023).
Some implicit measures have been implemented to mitigate privacy risks, such as:
1. Applying a k-anonymity of 3 such that at the finest granularity of dimensions there are still
at least three households.
2. Exposing Faraday only in a partial black-box setting; users submit inputs via an API to
generate outputs. No outputs are generated during sampling if the households matching
users’ inputs represent a small proportion of the training data.
3. Only outputting daily profiles (as opposed to weekly or monthly profiles) which limits
re-identification risk.
There is a trade-off between privacy and utility. Because of the inherent privacy risks such as the
potential re-identification of individuals, Faraday only outputs daily profiles - hence limiting the
4Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024
utility of its data to ‘intraday’ analysis at household level. However, outputs are still useful for inter-
day purposes on an aggregated or population level as seen from the comparison to substation outputs
in figure 5b.
4 F UTURE WORK AND CONCLUSION
Privacy is a central concern when it comes to sharing smart meter data as it contains highly sensitive
information. Existing literature on generating synthetic smart meter data places emphasis on fidelity
and utility metrics, but there is limited commentary on the privacy of synthetic smart meter data.
Whilst Faraday has implicit measures implemented to guard against privacy risks, more work should
be undertaken to explicitly quantify the privacy risks of generating synthetic smart meter data. This
could include implementing differential privacy (Abadi et al., 2016), or explicit evaluation tasks
such as membership inference or reconstruction attacks. Doing so could give us the confidence to
output time series of longer horizons, such as weekly or monthly, which would have even higher
utility for grid research.
