Abstract
Designing effective REDD+ policies, assessing
their GHG impact, and linking them with the cor-
responding payments, is a resource intensive and
complex task. GainForest leverages video predic-
tion with remote sensing to monitor and forecast
forest change at high resolution. Furthermore,
by viewing payment allocation as a feature selec-
tion problem, GainForest can efﬁciently design
payment schemes based on the Shapley value.
1. Introduction
Climate change is arguably humanity’s primary challenge,
demanding urgent, decisive action in line with the Paris
Agreement. Land use is a key component, accounting for
approximately 25% of total greenhouse gases (GHG). Land
use includes a wide range of critical issues, from deforesta-
tion and forest degradation through agriculture. The domain
is particularly challenging, given that the world’s growing
population and rising standards of living exert an increas-
ing pressure on food and consumer goods production, both
of which may lead to conﬂicting objectives with climate
change and biodiversity.
The REDD+ program (Reducing Emissions from Deforesta-
tion and Forest Degradation), is UNFCCCs scheme for the
reduction of emissions caused by forest protection measures.
However, designing effective REDD+ policies and actions,
assessing their GHG impact, and linking them with the cor-
responding payments, is a resource-intensive and complex
task for which there is considerable room for improvement
also with respect to private sector involvement.
There are delays in implementation, inconsistencies in the

a result a lack of actionable projects. Current efforts fall
short for fully leveraging the process and technology options
available today. The net result is insufﬁcient climate action
in the land management domain (including biodiversity pro-
tection) and a collective failure to meet the climate targets
set.
We propose GainForest, an interpretable machine learning
system that addresses concrete needs to improve the efﬁ-
ciency and effectiveness of Measurement, Reporting and
Veriﬁcation (MRV) processes in relation to forest conser-
vation efforts and climate ﬁnance instruments that rely on
MRV in order to incentivise sustainable land-use practices,
as well as Payment for Ecosystem Services and biodiver-
sity schemes that promote public and private investment in
sustainable land-use activities.
GainForest integrates large amounts of unlabeled satellite
imagery with labelled authoritative data from forest zoning
and plot ownership to predict land use change. Interpretable
machine learning approaches can then be used to guide fair
performance and model-based climate payments.
2. Predicting Forest Change
Figure 1. Given past deforestation (pink) patterns from Global
Forest Watch (left image), a video prediction model is able to
forecast in which regions a deforestation pattern is likely going to
spread to in the near future (blue boxes, right image)

creasingly important in ecosystem monitoring. Although
it provides a huge supply of data and detailed resolutions
(Digital Globe provides imagery up to 0.3m per pixel), many
downstream tasks, however, are constrained by a lack of
labels. Thus, current forest change alert systems such as
FORMA (Wheeler et al., 2018) are constrained to train shal-
low supervised classiﬁers on handcrafted features to detect
clear cuts in low resolutions (250m per pixel). Furthermore,
in humid regions where clouds are covering large parts of
forests, it can sometimes take months until forest change is
detected and an alert is raised. Assessment of forest change
suitable for performance-based payments such as the UN’s
REDD+ program is usually limited on a yearly basis (of-
ten leveraging a mosaic of numerous clear satellite imagery
combined with on-site measurements).
2.1. Leveraging Spatial and Temporal Dependencies
Recent research demonstrated (Jean et al., 2018; Xie et al.,
2016), that we can leverage spatial dependencies and trans-
fer learning techniques to pre-train efﬁcient representations
with deep learning models that allow us to fully leverage
the high resolutions of modern satellite imagery. Moreover,
by additionally considering the temporal dependencies of
remote sensing data we can reformulate land use change
prediction as a video prediction task (Lee et al., 2018) (see
Figure 1), enabling us to forecast the spread of deforestation
up to a daily basis1. Accurate image forecasting models can
support MRV decisions under uncertainty (e.g. predicting
deforestation areas in cloudy images) and can be combined
with additional authoritative data such as forest zoning and
plot ownership.
2.2. Local Stakeholder Engagement as Active Learning
Machine learning models predicting forest change in high
resolutions offer a valuable opportunity to engage and re-
ward local stakeholders for climate action. Local stakehold-
ers in respective regions can be queried by the model (e.g.
via a mobile app) and incentivized to conﬁrm or deny (un-
certain) predictions of the model on-site. Responses can
then be queried and used as future labels by the model using
active learning.
3. Performance-Based Payments Based on
Feature Value Contribution
One of the challenges of performance-based payments such
as REDD+ is how to distribute the payment from investors
and donors to the local stakeholders. A natural way of tack-
ling the attribution problem is to adopt a game-theoretic
viewpoint, where each stakeholder is modelled as a player
1Assuming we are leveraging Planet’s daily satellite imagery
coveragein a coalitional game and the usefulness of a player from
any subset of contributors is characterized via a utility func-
tion. The Shapley value (SV) (Shapley, 1953) is a classic
method in cooperative game theory to distribute the total
gains generated by the coalition of all players and has been
applied to problems in various domains in environmental
science. The reason for its broad adoption is that the SV
deﬁnes a unique proﬁt allocation scheme that satisﬁes a set
of properties with appealing real-world interpretations, such
as fairness, rationality, and additivity.
By deﬁning our climate utility function as machine learning
model and our stakeholders as feature input (see Figure 2),
we can solve the payment allocation problem as a feature
selection problem and leverage the efﬁcient SV computation
techniques that has been applied to ML feature selection (Co-
hen et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2012; Mokdad et al., 2015; Jia
et al., 2019; Lundberg & Lee, 2017). Climate investors can
then use the assigned SV for their investment decisions.

selection problem
4. Discussion
Machine learning-based MRVs for forest change combined
with the exponential data growth in remote sensing can scale
forest conservation efforts by providing more ﬁne-grained
predictions under uncertainty. Additionally by leveraging
techniques from interpretable machine learning such as ef-
ﬁcient SV calculation, we can reframe payment allocation
problems as efﬁcient feature selection problems, potentially
guiding climate investors in their decision making.
