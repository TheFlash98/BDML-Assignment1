Abstract
Creating a transparent, sector-specific database of actions that would result in
carbon emissions reduction is essential for guiding companies toward effective,
data-driven pathways to meet their net-zero commitments. Information on carbon
emissions reduction levers is scattered around greenhouse gas emissions disclosures
and sustainability reports in dense text forms, and no systematic, sector and region
specific reduction lever libraries are available to companies. This research proposes
a multi-agent system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically extract, classify, and
validate carbon reduction actions from publicly available sustainability reports. By
constructing a standardized database of reduction levers categorized by industry,
geography, and greenhouse gas scopes, this work empowers companies to prioritize
high-impact, cost-effective emissions reduction strategies. We plan to integrate
environmentally-extended input-output models to ensure that these actions are
closely tied to sector-specific emissive sources, increasing their relevance and scala-
bility. This initiative is expected to support companies in mitigating greenhouse gas
emissions by offering a practical resource that accelerates the transition to a low-
carbon economy, and makes actionable insights readily available to corporations,
industry and the research community.
1 Introduction
Over 9,000 companies, including more than half of the Fortune 2,000 companies, have pledged to
go net zero by mid-century [1]. As companies strive to achieve these goals, the need for actionable,
data-driven strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is increasing. Despite numerous
publications on mitigation strategies (e.g. from IEA [2], IPCC [3], US EPA[4]), a comprehensive,
standardized database of feasible actions is still lacking. Existing carbon reduction frameworks like
Project Drawdown [5] for example, though valuable, often overlook regional feasibility and lack
guidance on prioritizing high-impact strategies based on the emissive sources within each sector.
Having access to transparent, sector- and geography-specific data on successful corporate emissions
reductions initiatives is critical. While this information is often included in public sustainability
reports and other disclosures, it is typically buried within long-form text, tables, or figures. Other

specific guidance on carbon emissions reduction, but the non-standardized representation makes it
hard to quickly extract and compare actionable insights across companies and sectors.
This work aims to address this challenge by creating a standardized dataset of carbon emissions
reduction levers, categorized by industry sector and geography, and validated against environmentally-
extended input output models [8]. This dataset will be organized by emissive source, GHG scopes,
and associated quantitative metrics, allowing actions to be ranked by impact. Using pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, our system will
autonomously extract and classify reduction actions from publicly available sustainability reports to
build this dataset. The dataset will help prioritize high-impact strategies and provide a practical tool
for driving reductions.

2.1 Extraction pipeline
The overall framework is described in Figure 1. The first step involves extracting relevant text from a
list of publicly available sustainability and ESG reports. We propose using traditional text extraction
and cleaning methods (e.g. Tesseract OCR) for this step.
The next agent will then classify these chunks of text and summarize extracted information into
actionable climate solutions. We propose using transformers such as Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet
[9], or OpenAI’s GPT models [10] or BART[11] to perform context-aware text classification and
summarization. The actions will be structured it into a comprehensive knowledge database, including
key metadata such as industrial sector, associated North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) code, and geography. Validation of extracted actions will be done by domain experts
reviewing a random sample of actions. Domain experts will also help craft prompts to guide the
summarization process to ensure alignment with sustainability best practices. We will also evaluate
incorporating ClimateBERT [12], a model specifically trained on climate-related texts to enhance the
accuracy of extracted actions.
2.2 Categorizing actions into emissive sources
To equip companies with the tools to better understand effective strategies to reduce sector-specific
emissions, we will use an LLM-agent to classify each action extracted from sustainability reports
into a taxonomy of emissive sources. This agent will be refined on some domain specific information
such as IPCC’s classification of over 200 emissions sources [13, 14] which forms the basis for the
taxonomy. Examples of source category includes N 2O emissions from agricultural soil management
of cropland fertilizer. These emissions sources can be directly associated with actions such as
“applying controlled-release fertilizers and using precision farming to reduce N 2O emissions from
2cropland”. Domain experts will validate and refine the agent and its metadata to ensure it adequately
handles ambiguities in the IPCC’s taxonomy.
After classifying different actions, we propose validating and enhancing quantitative data on the
effectiveness of reduction actions using environmentally extended input-output models by conducting
an output contribution analysis. For example, the USEEIO model [8] covers 400 sector categories
and can trace emissions back to specific IPCC source categories [13]. We will extend this to other
countries by using Multi Regional Input Output models [15]. For each NAICS code represented in a
sustainability report, we will run an output contribution analysis to identify major emission sources
and associated geographies, mapping this data against the information extracted by the classification
agent. This will help identify the most significant direct and indirect GHG sources by NAICS code
and geography.
We also propose using zero-shot or few-shot classification models to categorize actions according
to GHG scopes [6]. For instance, an action like "replacing coolers with HFC-free coolers" in the
beverage manufacturing sector would fall under Scope 1 emissions for owned assets and Scope
3, category 1, for suppliers. This classification may help bridge the gap between corporate GHG
reporting and actionable strategies.
2.3 Data validation and estimation of metrics to rank actions
We propose a human in-the-loop workflow involving domain experts for model and output validations.
Experts will design prompts for LLM agents, review a subset of extracted levers, and improve prompts
based on validation to effectively mitigate false positives. We will also validate that extracted actions
are present in the reports, ensuring traceability by referencing relevant sources and pages. This
validation will inform the final task of estimating and ranking each action’s metrics.
In the final task, we will determine quantitative metrics for each climate action to rank them. We’ll
first aim to extract expected emissions reduction and cost of implementing an action directly coming
from reports. In the absence of such information, we will use data from output contribution analysis
to determine which actions are expected to result in highest reductions. We’ll also consult external
sources like Project Drawdown [5] for impact and feasibility, and rank actions by their frequency of
occurrence across reports to identify widely implemented actions. Feedback from the community is
welcome to refine and ensure the robustness of these metrics.
3 Expected outcomes and limitations of work
This proposal lays the foundation for creating a comprehensive, standardized database of carbon
emissions reduction levers to help companies meet net-zero goals. To enhance transparency and
scalability, we aim to open source this database and engage with large corporations and suppliers for
feedback and validation, ensuring the levers are relevant to each sector.
We recognize potential limitations, such as inherent selection bias in reported measures, and under-
reporting of feasibility and cost-effectiveness due to privacy concerns all of which may limit the
representativeness of the database. Additionally, aggregating reductions across measures may obscure
the impact of individual actions. By addressing these challenges, we hope to make this tool a practical
guide for organizations committed to meaningful and measurable emissions reductions.
4 Pathway toward climate impact
This database will serve a foundational climate playbook with sector-specific strategies for reducing
carbon emissions. It provides transparent, implemented actions from various industries, and will be
regularly updated with new sustainability reports to reflect the latest climate actions and strategies
being implemented by companies. For organizations just beginning their climate journey, this
resource will offer valuable insights and actionable steps, enabling them to start incorporating
emissions reduction into their business and financial planning from the outset.
