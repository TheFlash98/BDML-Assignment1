Abstract
Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most uncertain components of the global 1
water cycle. Improving global ET estimates is needed to better our understanding of 2
the global water cycle so as to forecast the consequences of climate change on the 3
future of global water resource distribution. This work presents a methodology to 4
derive monthly corrections of global ET datasets at 0.25 degree resolution. We use 5
ML to generalize sparse catchment-level water cycle closure residual information 6
to global and dense pixel-level residuals. Our model takes a probabilistic view on 7
ET datasets and their correction that we use to regress catchment-level residuals 8
using a sum-aggregated supervision. Using four global ET datasets, we show that 9
our learned model has learned ET corrections that accurately generalize its water 10
cycle-closure results to unseen catchments. 11
1 Introduction 12
In the context of Climate Change (CC), the demand on water resources is increasing as both flood 13
and drought related damages increase. Human activities are known to impact the global water 14
cycle. However observational uncertainties limit extreme hazard forecast capability and render 15
human contribution to CC trend estimates very challenging in the context of high natural climate 16
variability [1]. The main evidence of observational uncertainties and discrepancy in monitoring of 17
the hydrosphere is that the water cycle is still not closed [2]. The water cycle is modelled through 18
four components:, precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), river discharge (R) and water storage 19
differential (dS). Closing the water cycle refers to accurately quantifying each of these components at 20
a given spatial and temporal resolution so that they sum to zero on all spatio-temporal locations: 21
P−ET−R+dS= 0 (1)
Among the hydrosphere component, ET remains one of the most uncertain and elusive components of 22
Earth’s water balance: it is a difficult physical process to sense as it cannot be observed directly from 23
space, and its field measurement via eddy-covariance method raise limited spatial representatives 24
[3]. Improving ET is needed for an advanced closure of the water cycle at regional to local scales. 25
Such improvement would translate into an improved capability to monitor and forecast extreme 26
hazard and to attribute to human activity a more accurate part of global change. One the one hand 27
previous studies have succeed in optimizing ET using the water cycle closure as a constrain [11,12]. 28
but such attempts was limited to global or catchment scale and raise limitation in generalizing ET 29
correction at higher scale [13]. Very recently, ML have leverage the use of hydroclimatic variables 30
and large catchment database for inferring pixelwise correction on precipitation atlas [14]. In this 31
work, we propose a method that corrects existing global ET datasets so as to better close the water 32

which is only defined at the catchment scale, while we seek evaporation corrections at the pixel 34
scale. Second, R measurements are only sparsely available, so water cycle closure errors are only 35
available locally in space and time, while we aim to provide dense corrections to global ET datasets. 36
Our solution to both challenges is to use Machine Learning (ML) to generalize ET corrections from 37
sparse catchment levels to dense pixel level. We train a pixel-wise model to regress ET corrections 38
from globally available climatic indices, which allows us to generalize the learned corrections to 39
a dense pixel-wise resolution. Due to the nature of the R measurements, the supervision signal is 40
defined at the catchment level, so we train our model using a sum-aggregated supervision in which 41
we regress the sum of model outputs over catchment pixels to the catchment-level label. Our loss is 42
defined using a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) formulation, in which we use prior knowledge on ET 43
uncertainties to guide the supervision.We evaluate the ability of learned corrections to close the water 44
cycle on unseen catchments and report consistent improvements across 4 global ET datasets. We also 45
compare ET corrections to in-situ measurements and report improvements on 3 out of 4 datasets. 46
2 Dataset 47

locations and split.Figure 1 illustrates the location of training and 48
test catchments for which we have gathered data. 49
We investigate four different global ET datasets, 50
for each of which we learn and evaluate correc- 51
tions. Each dataset estimates ET using different 52
methodology and thus showcase different error 53
patterns. These datasets are Global Land Evap- 54
oration Amsterdam Model [6] version va.3 and 55
vb.3, the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) es- 56
timate [7] and the reanalysis ERA5 [8]. Our 57
dataset contains 663 catchments ( C) and covers 58
a time period ( T) of 192 months ranging from 59
January 2000 to December 2015, although many 60
months of data are missing for most catchments. In total, our dataset consists of 71654 monthly 61
catchment-level data points for which all components are available. Our model is defined at a spatial 62
resolution of 0.25 degrees, and a one month time resolution. It processes D= 7dimension input 63
feature vectors, representing ET, P, dS, and four climatic indices representing vegetation cover (LAI 64
[8], NDVI [9]), soil moisture [8], and surface water availability (P-E from [8]). Given an ET dataset 65
Ei, for each catchment c∈Cand for each month t∈T, the ground-truth correction yis given as 66
the difference y(c, t) =E(c, t)−Ei(c, t), where Erepresent the best catchment-level water cycle 67
closure corrected estimate we have. Ewas computed using the Optimal Interpolation (OI) method 68
proposed in [10], which accounts for uncertainty estimates of all water cycle component and has 69
been shown to improve the catchment-level estimates of all components [11]. In addition, we used a 70
catchment-level simple-weighting aggregation [10] of all four ET datasets as the input ET component 71
to the OI. For each catchment and month index pairs (c, t), our dataset thus provides an input output 72
pair(X(c, t), y(c, t)). As each catchment covers many pixels, Xrepresents a set of input feature 73
vectors X(c, t) ={xi∀i∈N(c)}, with xi∈RD,N(c)represents the number of pixels covered by 74
catchment c, andD= 7is the input feature dimension we use. 75
3 Method and Experiments 76
Our goal is to find a function fθ(x)that regresses pixel-wise ET corrections yto ET values Efrom 77
input x, and we refer as ˆE=E+yto the corrected evaporation values. We take a probabilistic view 78
of ET datasets and their correction. We consider each dataset to provide us with prior knowledge 79
on ET in the form of a Gaussian distribution centered on E:p(ˆE) =N(E|σE). Following a recent 80
review paper [2], we use the relative uncertainty estimate σE=7·E
100in our experiments. We can 81
2rewrite this prior in terms of yasP(y) =N(0|σ). We define a likelihood over the correction yas 82
a Gaussian distribution whose mean we parameterize with a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) hθ(x) 83
and with standard deviation σy, which we calibrate on a validation set: p(y|x) =N(hθ(x)|σy). The 84
correction fθ(x)we bring to each dataset is then defined as a MAP given the prior Pprovided by the 85
dataset and the parameterized likelihood function p: 86
fθ(x) =max yp(y|x)P(y) (2)
fθ(x) =σ2
E×hθ(x) + 0×σ2
y
σ2y+σ2
E(3)
fθ(x) =hθ(x)
1 +100×σ2y
7×E(4)
The rationale for this MAP formulation is that it allows to scale the correction with the original dataset 87
value: Indeed, ET estimates are, in absolute values, less error-prone in very dry regions (where ET is 88
close to zero) than in wet regions (where ET takes large values). The difference between using MAP 89
and likelihood corrections is illustrated in Figure 2. Although fθ(x)is defined at the pixel level, the 90
supervision yis defined at the catchment level. To train the model, we thus first apply the model 91
on the pixels of each catchments, then aggregate the model output by summation, and regress the 92
aggregated sum of corrections to the label y. For a given catchment and month, the catchment level 93
correction computed by our model is thus: 94
Fθ(c, t) =X
x∈X(c,t)fθ(x) (5)
so that we can write our loss function Land optimization problem as: 95
eθ(c, t) =Fθ(c, t)−y(c, t) (6)
L(θ) =1

c∈CX
t∈Teθ(c, t)2(7)
θ∗=min θ∈ΘL(θ) (8)
We analyse the errors of ET datasets before and after our correction to better understand the nature 96
of the corrections we bring. To do so, we decompose residual errors into three components: a bias 97
termBthat represents the average error per catchment, a seasonality term Srepresenting the errors 98
of monthly-averaged difference to the bias, and an anomaly term Athat random variations after 99
elimination of the systemic bias ans seasonality components. We denote by M={mi}to denote the 100
set of 12 months, and we write m(t)∈Mto denote the month of a given time index t∈T. Given a 101
catchment c∈Cat time ta residual term ycan be decomposed into three component as follows: 102
e(c, t) =e(y, c) +e(y, c, m (t)) +e(y, c, t ), in which: 103
b(e, c) =1

t∈Te(c, t) (9)

t∈me(c, t)−b(y, c) (10)
a(e, c, t) =e(c, t)−b(y, c)−s(y, c, m (t)) (11)
Ignoring the cross terms, which were empirically found negligible, we can then decompose the loss 104
into three residual error components that give us more insights on the nature of the ET residual error. 105

Figure 2: Illustration of MAP impact.
We trained a MLP with 4 hidden layers of width 512 on a training set of 496 catchments using the 106
Adam [5] optimizer, and evaluated its accuracy on a test set of 166 catchments. Splits were built so 107
that no train catchment overlap, even partially, with the test catchments. We report generalization 108
results on the test split in terms of MSE, and decompose the error into the three components: B,S,A. 109
Impact of MAP modeling : Figure 2 compares the per-pixel mean corrections of the likelihood hθ 110
and the MAP fθ. The MAP successfully reduces the high biases of the likelihood above the Sahara 111
region in which ET is expected to remain close to zero for the absence of water. 112

Water cycle closure : Figure 3(a) shows the MSE of water cycle closure of each dataset before and 113
after applying our corrections. We successfully reduce the water closure gap on all components. In- 114
situ measurements : In Figure 3(b), we show the the MSE to in-situ measurements of the FLUX 115
dataset [15] before and after applying our learned corrections. We find corrected global ET values to 116
better fit in-situ measurements for three out of the four datasets. 117
4 Conclusion 118
Improving global ET estimates is needed to better our understanding of the global water cycle, so as 119
to better understand the consequences of climate change on the future of global water distribution. In 120
this work, we proposed a methodology to learn a correction of global ET datasets. Our method uses 121
ML to generalize sparse catchment-level water cycle closure residual information to global, dense, 122
pixel-level residuals. To do so, we modeled a pixel-level model that we trained to regress catchment- 123
level residuals using a sum-aggregated supervision. Using four global ET datasets, quantitative 124
experiments have shown the ability of our model to generalize to unseen catchments and to reach 125
relative agreement with in-situ measurements. 126
