Abstract
This paper uses the principles of online convex learning to propose a
momentum-optimized smart (MOS) controller for energy management of
residential PV-storage systems. Using the self-consumption-maximization
application and practical data, the method’s performance is compared to classical
rolling-horizon quadratic programming. Findings support online learning methods
for residential applications given their low complexity and small computation,
communication, and data footprint. Consequences include improved economics for
residential PV-storage systems and mitigation of distribution systems’ operational
challenges associated with high PV penetration.

1 Introduction
A wide range of Energy management systems (EMS) methods are proposed for residential solar
photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage systems (BSS) [1]–[6]. Shared among these methods is the need
for time series forecasting, proprietary solvers or inference engines, and a sizeable need for historical
operational data ([7]). Such requirements are typically challenging to satisfy in the residential
systems, suppressing these methods’ practical implementation [8]. Motivated by these gaps, this
paper leverages online convex learning to propose momentum-optimized smart control (MOS), a
low-complexity data-driven method that is sample-efficient, does not rely on time series prediction,
and is ideal for ensemble or hybrid implementations. MOS outperforms classical optimization
methods that rely on a persistence-based forecasting system. The method increases the investment
rate of return of residential PV-BSS by increasing the efficiency of planning and operation, leading to
an increased share of clean energy in the residential sector. In addition, more effective BSS operation
mitigates the distribution systems’ challenges associated with the increased share of residential PV .
2 Problem Statement
For many jurisdictions and within the foreseeable future, residential PV-BSS EMS will likely remain
focused on local applications that do not require coordination among these systems. This limitation
is due to the extensive need for communication infrastructure, the lack of proper regulation and
incentive mechanisms, and the requirement for Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) [7], [8].

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Consequently, the two primary applications for these systems are self-consumption maximization
(SCM) and time-of-use arbitrage (TA) ([9]). Without the loss of generality, the problem is formulated
for the SCM application, as the TA application shares a similar form of objectives and constraints.
Consider the set of time intervals T. For each time interval t∈ T, denote Pb,tas the ac power
injected/absorbed by the BSS, Ppv,tas the ac power injected by PV , Pd,tas the ac power consumed
by the residential unit, and Pg,tas the net power consumed/produced, i.e.:
Pg,t=Pd,t+Pb,t−Ppv,t (1)
where Pb,tis positive for battery charging and is negative for battery discharging. Similarly, Pg,tis
positive for net power consumption by the residential system and is negative for net power production.
Forx∈Rn, define the L2(x)norm as ∥x∥2=pPn
t=1x2
t, where xtis the tthentry of the vector x
fort∈ T. The SCM problem is formulated in classical optimization toolboxes as follows:

2.1 Online Convex Learning and MOS
An online convex learning problem is defined as follows [10]; consider the convex feasible set
C⊆Rn, and an infinite sequence of convex cost functions {ft:C→R}∞
t=1. The definitions of
convex set and function are provided in Appendix A. At each time step t:
1. The algorithm selects a point xt∈Cwithout knowledge of the cost function ft.
2. The cost function ftis then revealed, and the algorithm incurs a cost ft(xt).
The objective of online convex learning is to minimize the cumulative cost over time, i.e.,
min
x∈CTX
t=1ft(xt) (6)
Lemma 1 The problem described by equation 2-5 satisfies the online convex learning.
The proof for this lemma and others are provided in Appendix B. Mos is based on the Greedy
Projection algorithm proposed by in [10]. The authors in [10] discuss seven assumptions as
prerequisites of their algorithm. The algorithm, its assumptions, and the proof that the problem
described by Equation 2-5 satisfies them are discussed in Appendix C.1. MOS is based on a variant
of Equation 2, in which a BSS action momentum term to ft(xt)is introduced as follows:
f′
t(xt) = (Pg,t)2+µe(−|Pb,t|)(7)
where µis a tunable hyperparameter. Consider the following convex feasibility set:
S′
t=

[Smin
t,0] ifPb,t−1<0
St ifPb,t−1= 0
[0, Smax
t]ifPb,t−1>0(8)
where Smin
t= min(Pmin
b,(emin−et−1)η/∆t)andSmax
t= max(Pmax
b,(emax−et−1)/(η∆t)).
Lemma 2 f′
t(xt)is convex over S′
t.
2Define the distance d(x, y) =∥x−y∥, andPS′
t(y) = arg min x∈S′
td(x, y). Thus, the proposed
MOS is described in Algorithm 3. In this algorithm, the decision at each interval Pb,tis updated
based on the gradient of the modified objective function in Equation 7. The exponent serves as a
moment of inertia for the BSS actions, i.e., when Pb,t−1is slightly positive (charging) or negative
(discharging), the next action tends to be more charge or discharge, respectively. The moment
of inertia exponentially decreases as the battery charging or discharging setpoint increases. The
intuition is that the upward/downward trends of the net demand profile are captured more effectively.
Furthermore, as discussed before, the feasibility set in Equation 8 does not allow a sudden change
of charge to discharge and vice versa between two consecutive intervals. αis the learning rate, i.e.,
the magnitude of the steps taken toward the gradient descent. κis a regularization factor between
the decision variable and that of 24 steps before, i.e., the similar time interval of the day before. The
regularization is inspired by the well-studied daily seasonality in the residential demand and PV [11].

3 Results
3.1 Data
One year of real-world residential load and PV data is used to evaluate the performance of MOS and
compare it with a classical quadratic programming (QP) method. The QP method is described in
Appendix C.2. The load data is obtained from [12], which includes anonymized residential demand
profiles in 30-minute granularity, operating under AusNet Services’ jurisdiction in Australia. The PV
profiles are obtained in 5-minute granularity from solar panels implemented on a university campus in
North America. These profiles, as well as the “net demand," are shown in Figure 2 in Appendix D.1.
The authors acknowledge that selecting the profiles from two different locations may compromise
the fidelity of the net demand profile; saying that there is no evidence that such a compromise has
a clear impact on the fidelity of the conclusions. The BSS power and energy capacity are varied
through trainings and tests to analyze sensitivity to BSS ratings. Without the loss of generality,
the charging/discharging efficiency is considered 1. If anything, this assumption helps reduce the
complexity of the conventional optimization problem, eliminating the need for integer variables. The
assumption has no tangible impact on the computational complexity of MOS.
The hyperparameters α,µ, andκare tuned using the hyperparameter optimization framework Optuna
[13], with α∈[0.01,1.0],µ∈[0,5], and κ∈[0,0.75]. The results are shown in Table 1 in
Appendix D.2. The hyperparameters are tuned only on the month of March and the algorithm is
tested on April-October, thus exhibiting a considerable sample efficiency property. The intuition is
3that the net demand profile is stationary over the period; while the magnitude of net demand may
change from one period to another, the relation autocorrelation stays the same.
3.2 Performance Comparison
The methods’ performances are shown in Figure 1. The results for the training set are not reported
but are similar in proportion to the results of the test set. In Figure 1, the QP method is shown by
the red line with square marks, and MOS by the dashed black line with cross marks. Four different
performance metrics are compared, L2
2,L1, BSS cycling, and average daily peak of net demand
absolute value. These are compared over the BSS size of 2, 4, and 6 kW, each with the C-rate of
1/2, 1/4, and 1/6. The methods are executed on a Windows PC with 13thGen Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-13700H 2.90 GHz and 64 GB of RAM.
Figure 1: Performance comparisons between MOS and CPLEX.
The main observations are as follows:
•The data from BSS sizes 2-8 and 4-24 is missing for the QP method. This is because the
method did not converge for at least one of the 24-hour-ahead runs. This demonstrates the
complexity of these solvers and the likelihood of computational issues.
•MOS outperforms QP in L2
2by 6.5%, L1by 7.1%, cycling by 18%, and daily peak by 2.4%.
•QP takes approximately 200 s to solve the problem for one BSS size over the test period;
MOS takes around 0.1 s over the test period.
•The data size for one year of operation is 137 kB. During operation, QP relies on the
persistence forecast and thus requires the past 24 hours of data. Similarly, MOS tracks the
past 24 hours of data, though it only uses the data for the interval -24h+ ∆t.
4 Conclusions
A data-driven sample-efficient method was proposed for residential PV-BSS systems that can
meaningfully outperform classical optimization toolboxes in a practical setup. The simplicity
combined with the superiority has a meaningful impact on the economics of residential PV-BSS
systems; using MOS in planning studies can result in more utilized resources, and using it in
operation can reduce the supplied cost of electricity and mitigate operational issues associated
with high penetration of PV . Future works include theoretical analysis of MOS’ sample efficiency,
economic analysis of performance metrics, and robustness to net demand profile distribution.

5A Definitions
Definition 1 The set C⊆Rnis convex if and only if ∀x, y∈Cand∀λ∈[0,1], λx+ (1−λ)y∈C.
Definition 2 A function f:Rn→Ris said to be convex over a convex set C⊆Rnif, for all
x, y∈Cand for all λ∈[0,1], the following inequality holds:
f(λx+ (1−λ)y)≤λf(x) + (1 −λ)f(y)
B Proofs
Proof 1 Setft(xt) = ( Pg,t)2and hence xt=Pb,t. Convexity of ftis given. At each time step t,
Pb,tis selected from the following convex feasibility set2:
St= [ min(Pmin
b,(emin−et−1)η/∆t),
max(Pmax
b,(emax−et−1)/(η∆t))](9)
The function ftis then revealed by Equation 1. ■
Proof 2 ∇e(−|Pb,t|)is−sgn(Pb,t)e(−|Pb,t|), where −sgn(Pb,t)is the sign function. Thus, the
gradient is expressed as follows:
∇e(−|Pb,t|)=

−e(−Pb,t)ifPb,t>0,
e(Pb,t)ifPb,t<0,
0 ifPb,t= 0(subgradient)(10)
Convexity of Equation 10 is given in each of the three Pb,tranges. Thus, given that the S′
tis defined
such that Pb,tcannot change sign compared to the decision in the previous interval, f′
t(xt)does not
encounter discontinuities or non-linear transitions that would affect its convexity. ■
C Algorithms
C.1 Greedy Projection
Define the distance d(x, y) =∥x−y∥. Thus, in the context of our problem, it is assumed that:
1.∃N∈Rsuch that d(x, y)≤N,∀x, y∈St,
2.Consider the sequence {x1, x2, . . .} ∈St; if there exists a point x∈Rnsuch that x=
limk→∞xk, then x∈St.
3.∃x∈St.
4. The cost function ftis differentiable ∀t∈ T.
5.∃N∈Rsuch that ∥∇ft∥ ≤N,∀t∈ T and∀x∈St.
6.∇ftis computable given x∈Stand∀t∈ T.
7.arg min x∈Std(x, y)is computable ∀y∈Rn. Thus, define PSt(y) = arg min x∈Std(x, y).
Lemma The problem described by Equations 2-5 satisfies the above assumptions.
Proof Assumptions 1-3 implies the that Stis bounded, closed, and non-empty. These are given by
Equation 9. Assumptions 4 and 6 are satisfied given that ∇ft= 2Pg,t,∀t∈ T. Assumption 5 is
satisfied so long that Pd,t−Ppv,tis bounded, which is given. Assumption 7 is proven as follows; let
Smin
t= min(Pmin
b,(emin−et−1)η/∆t)andSmax
t= max(Pmax
b,(emax−et−1)/(η∆t)). Thus:
PSt(yt) =

Smin
t ifyt≤Smin
t
yt ifSmin
t< yt≤Smax
t
Smax
t ifyt> Smin
t(11)
2The feasibility set in [10] remains unchanged in time. This doesn’t impact our proofs, since our problem’s
feasibility set, though changing in time, satisfies all the framework’s assumptions.
6■
The Greedy Projection online convex learning method proposed in [10], applied to the problem
described in Equations 2-5, is as follows:
1. Select an arbitrary Pb,0∈S0;
2. Select an arbitrary sequence of α1, α2, ...∈R+;
3. Calculate Pb,t=PSt(Pb,t−1−αt−1∇ft(Pb,t−1)).
C.2 QP
The problem described in Section 2.1 can be solved by rolling horizon MIQP solvers, such as CPLEX
and Gurobi, see [14], [15]. In this case, the optimization problem is explicitly solved at each interval
over a horizon, for example, the next 24 hours. Thus, the method relies on time series prediction.
Algorithm 2 describes this control methodology. In this algorithm, ˆPx,tis the forecasted power during
interval t. Note that for the sake of notational consistency, there are no explicit integer variables in
algorithm 2; however, the “if" statements are logically coded by the integer decision variables on if
the battery is charging ( Pb,t≥0) or discharging ( Pb,t<0).

C.3 MOS Hyperparameter Tuning
A data-driven grid-search approach is proposed here that tunes the hyper-parameters that minimize:
∥Pg∥2
2+γ∥Pg∥1,∀t∈ T (12)
where ∥Pg∥1=P
t|Pg,t|(L1norm). Given the tuning’s data-driven nature, there is the flexibility to
add any other desired penalty (or reward) to Equation 12. In this case, a small percentage of the L1
regularization will ensure MOS does not overfit on L2
2minimization, thus, γ= 0.02.
