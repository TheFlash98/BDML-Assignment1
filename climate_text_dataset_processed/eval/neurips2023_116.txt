Abstract
High-fidelity topography models of the bedrock underneath the thick Antarctic
ice sheet can improve scientists’ understanding of ice flow and its contributions
to sea level rise. However, the bed topography of Antarctica is one of the most
challenging surfaces on earth to map, requiring aircrafts with ice penetrating radars
to survey the vast and remote continent. We propose FROST , Fusion Regression
for Optimal Subglacial Topography, a method that leverages readily available
surface topography data from satellites as an auxiliary input modality for bed
topography super-resolution. FROST uses a non-parametric Gaussian Process
model to transfer local, non-stationary covariance patterns from the ice surface to
the bedrock. In a controlled topography reconstruction experiment over complex
East Antarctic terrain, our proposed method outperforms bicubic interpolation at
all five tested magnification factors, reducing RMSE by 67% at ×2, and 25% at ×6
magnification. This work demonstrates the opportunity for data fusion methods to
advance downstream climate modelling and steward climate change adaptation.
1 Introduction
‘What happens in the polar regions, doesn’t stay in the polar regions.’ With average warming in
the polar regions exceeding global mean warming (polar amplification) [1], [2], the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets are expected to be major contributors to sea level rise [2], [3]. Greenland is
estimated to hold 7.4 m SLE (sea level equivalent; increase in average global sea level if completely
melted) [4], whereas the Antarctic ice sheet is estimated to hold 57.4 m SLE [5]. While there is
considerable disagreement between projections from Antarctic ice sheet models [6], [7], sea level
rise poses a threat to the large population living in coastal and low-lying regions, and thus reliable
projections are critical to guide climate change adaptation strategies.
Meanwhile remote sensing has accelerated progress in environmental monitoring and climate mod-
elling [8]. Satellite are instrumental in data collection for remote regions like Antarctica, and they
enable monitoring at sufficient spatial and temporal scales. While this increase in data, particularly
in near-surface data, opens up many pathways to impact for machine learning in climate [2], [9],
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.mapping Antarctica’s subglacial terrain remains logistically and technologically challenging [5], [10].
Nonetheless, gridded maps of the Antarctic bed topography as well as the distinct local features it
reveals (e.g. stabilising ridges or inland sloping [5]), are a fundamental input to many downstream
Antarctic climate studies [10]. Due to data limitations, the fidelity of Digital Elevation Models
(DEMs) of the subglacial landscapes remains a large source of uncertainty in ice volume estimation
and ice flow models [11]. International project groups have been assimilating data from ongoing field
campaigns of mostly airborne radar surveys to produce coherent topography grids of Antarctica like
BedMachine [5], [12], Bedmap2 [13], or the recently announced Bedmap3 [10].
2 Multimodal bed topography super-resolution
Pushing beyond the limited capacity to collect field data during resource-intensive sensing expeditions,
machine learning methods have been proposed [14], [15] to fill ice sheet modellers’ needs for
continent-scale, accurate, and detailed bed topography grids, given the data available. Super-resolution
(SR) is an established computer vision task, which aims to enhance the resolution of a given input
image. Viewing a topography grid as a 2D image indexed by x and y coordinates where elevation
values are the pixel values, the task is to learn the mapping ffrom the low-resolution ( lr) bed
topography image blrto the high-resolution ( hr) image bhr, where bhr=f(blr).
Figure 1: Schematic overview of multimodal bed topography super-resolution for Antarctica
Traditional single image SR, which takes the lrimage as the sole input, is a challenging inversion
problem with a poorly constrained solution space, particularly for data sparse domains. Probabilistic
machine learning methods address this by estimating a probability distribution over reconstructions.
The spread of the predictive distribution represents the level of confidence. Additional input modal-
ities, if available and related to the target modality, can aid SR. Pan-sharpening is a multimodal
SRtechnique commonly used in remote sensing, that merges multi-spectral images with spatial
detail from hrpanchromatic images [16]. Another multimodal method [17] adopts a probabilistic
perspective and proposes a Gaussian Process (GP) framework to upscale1infrared images of farmland
scenes by borrowing the covariance from multi-spectral hrdrone images of the same scene.
Whereas previous machine learning methods only have access to limited training data at target
resolution [14], [15] and thus produce biased estimates and artifacts, particularly in East Antarctica
which holds most of the continents’ ice, we adopt the multimodal Bayesian approach introduced by
Reid, Ramos, and Sukkarieh [17]. Rather than using an alternative sensing modality that measures the
same underlying landscape, we leverage surface elevation values s, available at very high resolutions
from satellites, as the auxiliary hrinput to assist bed topography SR, see Figure 1. While we
presume a relationship between ice surface and bedrock, the challenge is to model the non-linear,
non-stationary and non-deterministic relationship to achieve faithful hrbedrock representations.
3 F ROST : Fusion Regression for Optimal Subglacial Topography
We propose FROST (acronym for Fusion Regression for Optimal Subglacial Topography ), an adapta-
tion of the multimodal Gaussian Process (GP) framework introduced by Reid, Ramos, and Sukkarieh
(2013) [17]. FROST infers hrbed topography from the lrbed topography input as well as the

This is contrary to terminology used in the climate community where downscaling describes resolution increase.
2auxiliary hrsurface topography input, with both inputs corresponding to the same area, see Figure 1.
At the core of this kernel-based method is the design of the covariance function kthat facilitates
transfer learning. Rather than defining the covariance between pairs of points, we define covariance
between pairs of grid cells i.e. pixels (Phr, P′
hr)[17]. Furthermore, kis defined in the modality of
the auxiliary input, the ice surface elevation values s(Phr), to enable the GP to learn non-stationary
covariance patterns at target resolution. The covariance matrix computed from the auxiliary variable
acts as a high-resolution covariance substitute in the GP interpolation of the hrbed elevation values.
k(Phr, P′
hr) =ks(Phr, P′
hr)◦kaux(s(Phr), s(P′
hr))×σ2
f (1)
The covariance function kis composed of a spatial covariance term ksand the auxiliary covariance
termkaux, see Equation 1. The spatial covariance term kscreates sparsity in kby controlling a
threshold distance, defined by a hyperparameter, at which the covariance of pixel pairs reduces to zero.
The sparsity yields computational efficiencies, especially in the inversion of large covariance matrices
required for GP regression. ksis implemented as a piece-wise polynomial kernel between spatial
locations of grid cell mid-points, and thus acts as a sparse, smooth , and local filter for the second
covariance term, kaux. The auxiliary covariance term kauxintroduces non-stationary behaviour ,
critical for elevation modelling. A squared exponential kernel is used to compute the similarities
between pairs of surface elevation values (s(Phr), s(Phr)′), with another hyperparameter controlling
the sensitivity. Hereby, distinct sub-input-grid features like discontinuities or roughness, present on
the surface, can be captured in the covariance matrix. Finally the positive definite covariance matrix
is computed as the element-wise product of ksandkauxand then scaled by σ2
f. Refer to Figure 4 in
the Appendix for an illustration of the covariance composition.

Within FROST ’s GP framework, the predictive mean function µ∗, see Equation 2, generates hrbed
topography estimates, where hyperparameter σ2
ndenotes the noise term and µbdenotes the bed
elevation mean constant. With kdefined over hrpixel pairs, covariances k(Phr, Plr)andk(Plr, Plr)
are derived by averaging those hrcovariance values that the larger, lrpixels are spatially composed of.

to [17] and the GP literature [18] for further methodological details. Figure 2 demonstrates how
Figure 2: Inputs, ×6 reconstructions and ground truth bed topography for exemplary scene in East
Antarctica. Lighter hues indicate higher elevation.
FROST is able to transfer fine-scale, intricate patterns from the ice surface to the hrestimate of
the bed topography. Although surface slope and bedrock slope are merely related at image level in
this example, wave-like ridges correspond between surface and glacier base. The basal ridges are
not visible in lrso that smooth bicubic interpolation fails to reconstruct these features. With well
calibrated hyperparameters, our methods improves over standard single image interpolation.
4 Preliminary experiments
In this section we present controlled bed topography image reconstruction experiments at magnifica-
tion factors ×2,×3,×4,×5and×6forN= 400 images from the East Antarctic interior. Hereby
we seek to evaluate FROST ’s super-resolution skill in comparison to baselines in a controlled setting
with known ground truth, to determine its potential to produce faithful topography grids at higher
resolutions than existing data products and to fill data voids. We use the MEaSUREs BedMachine
3Antarctica, Version 3 [5], [12] data set, containing bed elevation and surface elevation data on a
square 500 m grid. As a non-trivial test bed we select a region with complex topography and high
ice thickness in the East Antarctic interior, around Dome A (see Figure 5 for the location). We then
divide the domain into 400 images, each consisting of 60 x 60 pixels. The ground truth bed elevation
images, bhr, are degraded to five different coarse resolutions, producing input images blr. This
results in reconstruction tasks of increasing difficulty, with magnification factors m∈[2,3,4,5,6].
For example, for m= 6, we are upscaling a low-resolution 10 ×10 pixel image to reconstruct a
high-resolution 60 ×60 image, see Figure 2. The auxiliary input, surface elevation shr, is also given
at 60×60 target resolution. The aim is to reconstruct bhrgiven blrandshr. We use two qualitative
metrics, Root Mean Square Error ( RMSE ) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( PSNR ) to compare mean
reconstruction errors of our proposed method to bilinear and bucubic interpolation baselines. Table 1
contains results of our experiments. Please also refer to Figure 3 for plots of the reported results and
Appendix 5 for more information on metrics.

5 Discussion
We present FROST , a probabilistic super-resolution model that addresses the mapping challenge of
Antarctica’s hidden bed terrain, by aiming to increase the fidelity of existing bed topography grids.
In our experiments we upscale gridded lrbed elevation images up to a magnification factor of ×6
(i.e. from 3000 m to 500 m resolution) using widely available surface elevation measurements as an
auxiliary hrinput. Despite high ice thickness separating surface and bedrock in the experiment’s
domain, our method is able to transfer local covariance patterns and thereby outperform interpolation
baselines: We reduce bicubic RMSE by over 67% for ×2 magnification and 25% for ×6 magnification.
These preliminary results demonstrate a proof of concept for our multimodal GP framework. Further
experiments are needed to compare our proposed method against more sophisticated baselines
on a continental scale. Future work should therefore explore an extension to non-stationary GP
hyperparameters as well as the use of other probabilistic and meta-learning approaches like Neural
Processes [19], [20]. These techniques may enable the model to adapt to different terrain types
(e.g. mountains, basins, coastal areas) without local hyperparameter tuning. Additional satellite
observed modalities, like ice surface velocity used in [14], could be incorporated and combined with
physics-guided approaches for robust inversion.
Deep learning methods, including CNNs and more recently Transformer-based methods like HAT
[21], [22] or SWIN [23], [24], are clearly dominating single image super-resolution benchmarks.
Further work should assess their performance on bed topography super-resolution tasks and adapt
these state-of-the-art methods to the challenges of the cryosphere domain including data limitations.
Training on more accessible topographic data sets may benefit domain adaptation. In contrast to
GAN-based DeepBedMap [14], which operates on a fixed set of input modalities to super-resolve
Antarctic bed topography, kernel methods have the ability to quantify uncertainty, adapt more easily
to new magnification factors and inputs, and provide an interpretable, flexible and robust covariance
mechanism. Non-parametric models like FROST also do not rely on target-resolution gridded training
data as deep learning models do. Nonetheless, fine-tuning approaches, utilizing embeddings from
pre-trained computer vision models, and adaptations to state-of-the-art super-resolution architectures
represent interesting research directions at the intersection of machine learning and climate. In
conclusion, both deep learning and Gaussian Process models have vast opportunity to exploit diverse
remote sensing data modalities for topography super-resolution and to thereby enhance ice sheet
modelling, improve resulting sea level rise projections and inform climate adaptation strategies.

Data availability
In this paper we use the MEaSUREs BedMachine Antarctica, Version 3 [5], [12] data set. The data set can
be downloaded from from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, using the following link: https:
//nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0756/versions/3 (last accessed 28/11/2023).
BedMachine’s bed elevation data was inferred using mainly ice thickness measurements from airborne ice-
penetrating radar surveys. BedMachine’s surface elevation data originate from the Reference Elevation Model
of Antarctica (REMA) [25], a satellite-derived digital elevation model (DEM) that originally is available at
very high resolution < 10 m. Please refer to BedMachine’s user guide for more details: https://nsidc.org/
sites/default/files/documents/user-guide/nsidc-0756-v003-userguide.pdf .
Metrics and baselines
We use Root Mean Square Error ( RMSE ) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( PSNR ) to evaluate the performance
of our proposed method and to compare it against baselines. While other computer vision methods focus on
perceptual quality, we focus on subjective reconstruction error, as bed topography images are intended as data
input for use in downstream studies rather than as images for human perception.
The Root Mean Square Error ( RMSE ) between the ground truth bed topography bhrand corresponding recon-
struction ˆbhris defined by Equation 3, where an image consists of npixels.
RMSE =vuut1

i=1(bhr−ˆbhr)2 (3)
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( PSNR ) is defined by Equation 4, where R represents the maximum signal strength.
For topography reconstruction we set Rto the range of elevation values per image, as an upper bound for the
error signal. Thereby PSNR normalises errors with respect to the spread of elevation values in each specific
image.
PSNR = 20·log10R

Implementation details and hyperparameters
As the degradation operator we apply an average pooling convolution ( torch.nn.AvgPool2d in PyTorch)
to simulate the hrtolrtransformation. Scaling is only performed after degradation to avoid information
6leakage from ground truth data to the lrinputs. We implement bilinear and bicubic interpolation baselines using
PyTorch’s torch.nn.functional.gridsample function. The baseline methods only take blras input and
they do not require the auxiliary surface modality.

Domain in East Antarctica
The domain selected for the experiment is a 600 ×600 km area around Dome A in the East Antarctic interior,
located between the South Pole and the Amery Ice Shelf. The domain contains 20 ×20 (400) images with each
image spanning 30 ×30 km. The domain lies between [898,750, 1,498,750] projected x coordinate (in meters),
and [-250, 599,750] projected y coordinate (in meters), see 5. The projected coordinate system used in the
MEaSUREs BedMachine Antarctica, Version 3 data set [5], [12] is WGS 84 / Antarctic Polar Stereographic
(EPSG code: 3031). The median bed elevation of the domain is 747 meters, the median surface elevation is 3560
meters and the median ice thickness is 2679 meters. This domain does not contain any ice-free area, but only
grounded ice (ice sheets), which makes it a suitable test bed of the proposed method.
