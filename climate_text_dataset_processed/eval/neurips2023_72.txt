Abstract
Understanding the future climate is crucial for informed policy decisions on climate
change prevention and mitigation. Earth system models play an important role
in predicting future climate, requiring accurate representation of complex sub-
processes that span multiple time scales and spatial scales. One such process that
links seasonal and interannual climate variability to cyclical biological events is tree
phenology in deciduous broadleaf forests. Phenological dates, such as the start and
end of the growing season, are critical for understanding the exchange of carbon
and water between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Mechanistic prediction
of these dates is challenging. Hybrid modelling, which integrates data-driven
approaches into complex models, offers a solution. In this work, as a first step
towards this goal, train a deep neural network to predict a phenological index from
meteorological time series. We find that this approach outperforms traditional
process-based models. This highlights the potential of data-driven methods to
improve climate predictions. We also analyze which variables and aspects of the
time series influence the predicted onset of the season, in order to gain a better
understanding of the advantages and limitations of our model.

Understanding the future climate is important towards making political decisions for climate change
prevention and mitigation. The main method to predict future climate are large Earth’s system models
(ESMs). These models need to represent many complex sub-processes that span multiple time scales
and spacial scales to make good predictions. One such process is tree phenology in deciduous
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.broadleaf forest. Phenology describes the timing of periodic events in biological life cycles and links
them to seasonal and interannual variations in climate[ 12], for example the date when trees start
to grow or shed their leafs. Since understanding the length of the season in which the trees carry
functional leafs is essential to understand the exchange of carbon and water between the biosphere
and the atmosphere [ 28], in this work, we aim to predict the stat of this season (SoS) and end of this
season (EoS).
Two challenges emerge when predicting these phenological dates. First, the change between dormancy
and maximum leafs is not instantaneous but the number and maturity of leaves increases gradually.
Hence, researchers have to rely on thresholds. However, previous work demonstrated that the choice
of threshold has a significant influence on interannual patterns and long-term trends of these dates [ 14].
Second, the processes that relate meteorological events to these dates are non-linear, complex and not
fully understood. Nevertheless, ESMs often rely on simple models that use only very few simple
meteorological features, for example [16], or even prescribed phenology, for example [1, 22, 31].
One approach that can aid in addressing these challenges is hybrid modeling, as suggested by [ 15]
and applied in similar situations, for example, by [ 3,5]. Hybrid modeling is an approach where, in a
complex model, some parts are replaced by data-driven models. For phenology, large datasets are
available from satellite observations [ 26], in-situ studies [ 11], and near-remote sensing [ 28,23]. In
this work, we present a data-driven model for phenology. This is a first step towards replacing the
phenology model in a land surface model (LSM). We train a convolutional neural network (CNN),
namely a ResNet-152[ 7], on near-remote sensing observations of a plant phenological index in
deciduous broadleaf forest.
Near-remote sensing data is available in higher temporal resolutions and is more objective than in-situ
observations [ 11]. Further, they are less susceptible to atmospheric disturbance like clouds than
satellite observations [ 19]. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we, first, not only predict the
phenological dates SoS and EoS, but daily greenness indices, allowing us to calculate the dates with
different thresholds post-hoc. Second, we use a ResNet, which can learn complex relations between
meteorological time series and the phenological index from the data.
We compare our data-driven approach to two process-based approaches. First, LoGrop-P, the
phenology model of JSBACH [ 16], the LSM of ICON-ESM [ 10]; and second, a model that prescribes
phenology. We find that the data-driven model reduces the error compared to these models for daily
greenness by 16% and for the start of season (SoS) by 47% / 9%. However, we find no improvement
in predicting the end of season (EoS) and, in an ablation study, we find that our approach is only
slightly better than simpler data-driven models.
Finally, we use two methods to interpret the neural network. First, we use Integrated Gradients
(IG) [ 24] to understand which variables have the largest influence towards the start of season. To
understand, in particular, which time scales are important, we perform a wavelet transformation (WT)
on the input time series before using the CNN. We find that the network relies primarily on features
and scales that are more informative of the general climate than meteorological events.
Secondly, we employ an approach based on causal inference [ 18] to validate that the CNN relies
on growing degree days (GDD) and chilling days two higher level descriptors of the temperature
time-series that are known to be important towards the SoS and are used by the LoGro-P model.
2 Related Work
Predicting the greenness of forests using machine learning has been attempted before. For example,
[27] conducted a challenge where teams predicted the greenness of multiple different sites up to 30
days ahead. In contrast to this work, where we train one global model, the teams in the challenge
trained one model per site. Further, they did not use deep learning, but mostly simpler data-driven
approaches. In contrast, [ 6] trained a Long Short Term Memory model but also only on a single site
in the US.
3 Data and Methods
To calculate the phenological state of the forest, we use the green chromatic coordinate (GCC) [ 19]
from observations provided by the PhenoCam network [ 23]. Digital images are captured at various
2locations throughout North America at intervals ranging from half-hourly to daily. For each site, a
region of interest containing the canopy is selected, and the mean RGB color is calculated. The GCC
is given by
GCC =G/(R+G+B). (1)
Following previous work [ 28], we use the 90thpercentile of GCC for each day as the target. The
GCC dataset we use is provided by the PhenoCam network [ 23]. We use the data from all deciduous
broadleaf forest sites in the network that, contain at least one year of observations, are in the top two
data-quality groups and contain no GCC value below 0.1 or above 0.6. The data is standardized such
that the smallest value becomes zero and the largest value becomes one. We split the sites randomly
into 66 sites for training (247 site years), 9 sites for validation (37 site years), and 16 sites for testing
(73 site years).
As input, we use eleven meteorological variables: day length, precipitation, short-wave radiation,
snow-water equivalent, vapor pressure, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), minimum and maximum air
temperature (T min, Tmax), potential evapotranspiration, snow, and surface air pressure. The first ten
variables are part of Daymet project[ 25], a project that interpolates meteorological variables from
ground-based measurements, and the air pressure is taken from ERA-5 [8] reanalysis data.
Following [ 30], we decided for a direct rather than iterative multi-step prediction. We predict the
365 yearly values of GCC simultaneously using one neural network with 365 outputs. Further, to
account for legacy effects in vegetation, for example, reported in [ 29], we use the meteorological
observations of the current and the previous year, leaving us with eleven time series of 730 days.
We use a continuous wavelet transformation on each of the time series individually. We use the
Ricker-wavelet [ 20] with a scale of 2idays for i∈ {− 1, . . . , 8}positioned at each day of the time
series using zero padding.
We train a ResNet [ 7] on the wavelet-transformed time series. We stack the results for the ten scales
for all eleven variables along the first axis to create a 108 by 730 input with one channel. All input
values are normalized to mean zero and standard deviation one. Further, we use a late fusion of
the annual temperature and precipitation means over 30 years after the convolutional part of the
ResNet. We pre-train on ImageNet [ 21] and afterwards alter the CNN to the suitable input and output
dimensions.
Using [ 2], we optimize the size of the ResNet ({18, 34, 50, 101, 152}; optimal: 152) along other
hyper-parameters on the validation set. The other hyper-parameters are batch size ([1, 128]; optimal:
1), learning rate ([0.00001, 1]; optimal: 0.912), the parameters of the cosine annealing with warm
restarts ( t0: [10, 1000]; optimal: 790), the optimizer used ({Adam, SGD}; optimal: SGD), and the
number of epochs before training stops early ([1, 100]; optimal: 18).
To avoid over-fitting, we use multiple auxiliary tasks. In addition to the 90thGCC percentile,
we predict 20 additional color indices provided by the PhenoCam network, as well as five yearly
values for kernel-NDVI [ 26] from MODIS [ 13]: mean, standard deviation, and 50th, 75th, and 90th
percentile. We standardize all labels and minimize the sum over the individual mean squared errors.
To focus on GCC, we multiply the loss of the auxiliary tasks with a constant 0< λ < 1, which we
optimized as an additional hyper-parameter on the validation set ([0,1]; optimal: 0.890). An overview
is displayed in Figure 1. Finally, we add a random walk as an additional input. Later, we want to
interpret the importance of each variable, time-point, and scale using IG. To this end, we dismiss any
value that is less important than the 99.9 percentile of the random walk’s importance scores.
To reach a better generalization performance, we train twenty of these neural networks and use them
in an ensemble for inference. To this end, we calculate the final prediction as a weighted mean over
the predictions of the individual models. The weights are optimized using the validation set.
Additionally, we want to understand whether our data-driven model relies on high level features of the
temperature time-series. Since these features are not input variables, we cannot use IG or comparable
methods to determine whether they are relevant to the decision of the neural network. Instead we
use [ 18], a method based on causal inference. This method reduces the question whether a feature is
used by a deep neural network to a conditional dependence test. We use the HSConIC [ 4] for this
conditional dependence test with a level of significance of p= 0.05. Following [ 17], we validate
that this method is suitable, by adding two features that do not influence the SoS but are of similar
complexity to the features of interest.

4 Experiments and Results
To understand the quality and limitations of our data-driven model, we conduct four experiments:
First, we evaluate our model against two mechanistic models; second, we conduct an ablation study
on the different parts of our model; third, we quantify the importance of each variable towards the
SoS; and finally, we evaluate whether the network uses the same features as mechanistic models.
We compare the data-driven model (last line of Table 1) to two mechanistic models. The first model
uses a prescribed phenology (first line of Table 1). For this model we prescribe E(GCC|DoY )the
average GCC per day of year on the training set. The second model is LoGro-P, the phenology model
of JSBACH [16] (second line of Table 1).
For these models we compare the coefficient of determination between predictions and observations
for GCC (R2), on the GCC anomalies (R2
anomalies), on the start of season (SoS R2), and end of
season (EoS R2). Additionally, we report the root mean squared error for the GCC values (RMSE),
the SoS (SoS RMSE), and the EoS (EoS RMSE).
To estimate the start and end of season, we use the halfway point between the highest and lowest
GCC as a threshold. The LoGro-P model predicts the leaf area index instead of GCC but it is highly
related to GCC [ 28]. For this reason and because of the difficulties mentioned in [ 14], we calibrate
the estimations of the SoS and EoS of each model by training a linear correction on the validation set.
The results of the comparison are presented in Table 1. The data-driven approach outperforms the
mechanistic models for GCC and SoS, but not for EoS. The model increases R2by13% and reduces
the RMSE by 16% compared to prescribing phenology. For the SoS, the model reduces the RMSE by
47% (7.0 days) compared to the prescribed phenology and by 9%(0.9 days) compared to LoGro-P.
However, the coefficient of determination on the anomalies is only 0.198, and, for EoS, the error
increased by 3%(1.2 days).
In the ablation study, we remove the wavelet transformation and/or replace the ResNet by linear
regression. We find that the simpler models have a similar performance. The R2of the full model is
identical to the linear regression and the SoS RSME of the linear regression is 3.7% higher than for
the full model. Only R2
anomaliesimproved notably ( 27%).
Third, we want to quantify the importance of each variable towards the prediction of SoS by IG [ 24].
However, the SoS is not directly the output of the neural network. To be able to use IG, we add an
additional layer to the CNN, calculating
150−150X
t=80σ(gcct−0.5) (2)
withσthe sigmoid function. The result of this calculation is virtually identical to the values
determined by the threshold method ( R2= 0.986). For the importance analysis, we exclude years
where the start of season is predicted before day 80. The results are displayed in Figure 2. The most
important variables are the snow, the potential evapotranspiration, which is a predictor of the soil
moisture, and the minimum temperature. While these features are known to be meaningful towards
the SoS, we find that all days are of similar importance and long, close to yearly, periods are much
more relevant than daily periods, indicating that the network relies on a general climate rather than
specific meteorological events.
We compare this result, to the coefficients of the linear classifier. Following [ 9] we multiply each
linear coefficient with the standard deviation of the variable. We consider the linear classifier for
4day of year (DoY) 120. Similar to our model, the linear classifier also relies on all days and not
specifically on the DoYs directly prior to DoY 120. Further, the three most importance features
according to the linear classifier are the air pressure, the vapor pressure and the vapor pressure deficit.
The minimum temperature, a feature that many mechanistic models use exclusively, is ranked eighths.
Figure 2: On the left, we display the observation and prediction for one example from the test set.
On the right, we show the importance of each variable as evaluated by IG. The variables are ordered
by absolute mean importance. Each row shows the distribution of influences on the SoS over all
site-years. The orange line marks the mean.
Finally we want to test whether our model relies on the same high-level features as the mechanistic
LoGro-P model. This model relies on two features to predict the SoS [ 16]: the chill days, the number
of days below four degrees Celsius before a day of the year, and the growing degree days
GDD =doyX
t=1max(0 , Tt−277.15K) (3)
where Ttis the mean temperature at day t. We determine whether our model also relies on these
features at DoY 120. To avoid detecting the importance of the average temperature, we decorrelate
these features from from the average temperature. Following [ 17], we validate that this method of
[18] is suitable, by testing two additional features that do not influence the SoS but are of similar
complexity to the features of interest: the chill days and GDD of the previous year.
We find that the network uses the chill days and growing degree days of the current but not the
previous year to determine the SoS.
5 Conclusions and Future Research
In this work we compare a data-driven method to two mechanistic models. We find that our model
performs better in predicting the greenness of canopies and in predicting the start of season. However,
the architecture only slightly outperforms much simpler architectures. We further analysed which
features are used by the neural network to predict the start of season. While we found that our model
considers the features used by the mechanistic LoGro-P model and considers variables relevant that
are considered by experts, the analysis with integrated gradients revealed that the model considers
mainly long time scales and does not focus on the time period directly before the start of season. This
indicates that the model understood the impact of the brought climate on the phenology but not the
influence of meteorological events.
We found that no model can detect the end of season with any accuracy. This might be due to
problems in the data that might already add a high amount of uncertainty to the day of year when the
end of season is observed. Further, the data has considerable differences between sites, likely due to
differences in the data acquisition, for example, different orientations and angles of the cameras.
Therefore, this approach could be improved by considering data from different sources or putting a
stronger focus on normalizing the GCC data according to site specific properties.
