Unsupervised Temporal Clustering to Monitor the
Performance of Alternative Fueling Infrastructure
Kalai Ramea1
Abstract
Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) play an important
role in the decarbonization of the transportation
sector. For a wider adoption of ZEVs, providing
a reliable infrastructure is critical. We present a
machine learning approach that uses unsupervised
temporal clustering algorithm along with survey
analysis to determine infrastructure performance
and reliability of alternative fuels. We illustrate
this approach for the hydrogen fueling stations in
California, but this can be generalized for other
regions and fuels.
1. Introduction
The transportation sector accounts for about 33% of the
total end-use carbon emissions highest among all the sectors
in the US. Speciﬁcally, emissions from light-duty vehicles
account for more than half of the total emissions in the trans-
portation sector (AEO, 2018). Several countries have been
adopting an increasing number of incentives to decarbonize
the light-duty vehicle sector through zero-emission vehicles
(ZEV). This has been reﬂected in the recent uptake of bat-
tery electric vehicle (BEV) ﬂeet all over the world (Lutsey,
2015). However, there are still concerns among consumers
about purchasing a BEV regarding range limitation, long
charging times and charger congestion (Wahlman, 2013).
To further increase the total market penetration of ZEVs in
the light-duty ﬂeet, a portfolio approach of technological
diversity is needed that addresses the variety of concerns
expressed by the consumers. In California and Japan, hy-
drogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) were introduced in recent
years and are being increasingly adopted alongside BEVs.
There are currently over 5,800 FCVs in California (CAFCP,
2019a), and it is estimated that about 40,000 FCVs will be
on the Californian roads by 2022 (ARB, 2018). FCVs have
a longer driving range, signiﬁcantly shorter refueling time

gasoline. Thus, they can play an important role in expanding
the light-duty vehicle ZEV market as they have the potential
to complement and alleviate some of the concerns raised
about the BEVs.
One of the biggest barriers to FCV adoption is the reliability
and availability of hydrogen fueling stations. Unlike BEVs,
which have multiple modes of charging (home, work, pub-
lic chargers), FCVs solely rely on access to public fueling
infrastructure. The reputation of an unreliable station may
discourage consumers from adopting the technology (Kel-
ley, 2018). Therefore, for signiﬁcant market acceptance of
FCVs, policymakers should not only consider a good net-
work of hydrogen refueling stations but also have a metric
to assess their performance on a real-time basis.
Existing Literature: In the past, researchers have devel-
oped various designs of what constitutes an optimal network
of hydrogen stations in the pre-planning stage (Ogden &
Nicholas, 2011; Stephens-Romero et al., 2010). Several
modeling approaches have been explored to understand the
spread and quantity of hydrogen refueling station designs
(Lim & Kuby, 2010; Nicholas & Ogden, 2007; Honma &
Kurita, 2008; Bhatti et al., 2015; Kang & Recker, 2015).
However, there has been little focus on assessing and moni-
toring the performance of existing stations. Although Na-
tional Renewable Energy Laboratory has published speciﬁc
data products on hydrogen station infrastructure (NREL,
2019), most of this data explains the technical details of
the hydrogen fuel delivery and the adoption of fuel at the
regional level on the supply side.
In this paper, we demonstrate an unsupervised temporal
clustering approach on the hourly utilization data that was
collected as a part of this project. To better understand the
reasons behind the clustered categories, we conducted a
survey of 100 FCV drivers in California. This approach
identiﬁes the stations that are performing within the healthy
range, and those that are over-stressed and intervention is
needed. We are publicly releasing the hourly station capac-
ity dataset we collected for this research project1. To the

best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that focuses
on deploying a machine learning algorithm to analyze the
micro-level usage of hydrogen fueling stations as a syn-
chronous network to monitor their performance.
2. Methodology
The project was completed in three phases as follows: (a)
Data collection, (b) Unsupervised temporal clustering, and
(c) Survey analysis.
2.1. Data Collection and Pre-processing
To ground the analysis in real world data, we collected
the hydrogen capacity data of all the fueling stations in
California. The California Fuel Cell Partnership website
(CAFCP, 2019b) provides information on the hydrogen
fueling station locations and their real-time capacity levels
in kg. The results shown in this paper is based on the hourly
data collected for a period of three months starting from
October 2018 to December 2018. A snapshot of utilization
patterns of the stations is shown in Figure 1.

Campbell and Lake Forest stations
The missing data in the time series due to technical issues
in reporting were imputed through linear interpolation2. As
the capacity varies across the stations, the time-series data

values on the website, so these stations are ignored in the analysis.
Three new stations were added towards the end of December 2018.

2.2. Unsupervised Temporal Clustering
Unsupervised cluster analysis has been extensively used
in several domains to study categories of distinct classes
occurring in the dataset, with the most common and popu-
lar algorithm being the K-Means Clustering (Stuart, 1982).
While this may work well on most univariate or multivariate
datasets, this density-based clustering approach has limita-
tions when applied to time-series or spatial data as it cannot
handle the dependencies across data points.
Temporal clustering is increasingly being used in ﬁnance,
IoT and energy domains to identify behavior variation and
anomaly detection (Urosevic et al., 2018; Hendricks et al.,
2016). Calculating distance measures across multiple time-
series sequences is a tricky task, and can often depend on
what invariance is considered to measure in the respective
domains. However, Batista et al. proved that the complex-
ity invariant distance measure is generally applicable to
most time-series datasets (Batista et al., 2011). This dis-
tance measure calculates Euclidean distance between the
two time-series and a correction factor is applied that factors
in the differences in complexities. We use this approach to
analyze the behavioral variation across the time-series fuel
utilization data of hydrogen stations.
Although there is an underlying spatial component in the
data, the station locations are sparse enough at this point and
are considered independent of each other. We conﬁrmed this
by calculating Moran’s I coefﬁcient (Anselin et al., 2006) for
the locations at different time intervals, and found that there
is no signiﬁcant spatial autocorrelation. However, as more
stations are added in the future, this approach would require
a spatiotemporal clustering algorithm to better understand
how the location of the station contributes to their respective
behavior and utilization.
2.3. Survey Analysis
In the third phase of the project, we designed a short, sim-
ple survey on hydrogen fueling station performance. We
recorded answers from about 100 participants who currently
drive FCVs in California3.
The following are the list of questions answered by the sur-
vey participants: (a) location, (b) most and least preferred
stations, (c) reasons for station preferences, (d) backup sta-
tions, and (e) reasons for station avoidance. For the reasons
behind the station preferences, respondents were asked to
choose all the reasons that apply, such as proximity to home,
proximity to work, reliability, hours of operation, safe neigh-

borhood, no station congestion, ease of use, and were asked
to check whichever ones apply to them. They were also
encouraged to record any other comments under ‘Other
(specify)’).
3. Results
The results shown in Figure 2 indicate that there are four sig-
niﬁcant clusters based on the temporal utilization patterns of
hydrogen stations. To understand what these clusters mean,
we took the survey responses as well as station attributes to
divide them into the following categories.
1.Reliable stations: The top preferred stations identiﬁed
by the survey respondents as most reliable appear in
cluster group 1. These stations act as a guideline for
determining whether the fueling station is performing
as intended.
2.Over-stressed stations: The survey respondents were
asked to identify the stations they found to be ‘too
busy’. As cluster group 2predominantly aligns with
this answer, they are identiﬁed as stations that need
intervention in terms of increase in storage capacity or
a supplementary station nearby.
3.Non-standardized Reporting: Cluster group 3of hy-
drogen stations appear to have a different storage mech-
anism. The liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped and stored
in a bigger tank which is held at a cryogenic tempera-
ture, which is then vaporized, compressed and stored
in a smaller tank for dispensing (CAFCP, 2019c). The
capacity values reported are that of the smaller tank
which does not reﬂect the actual capacity of the station.
For standard comparison across stations, this reporting
mechanism needs be adjusted.
4.Connector stations: Two stations, Harris Ranch and
Lake Tahoe are clustered together in group 4as these
are buffer stations for people traveling long distances
and are not used on a regular basis.
5.Unusual downtime: West LA station stands out in the
cluster group as there was an unusual downtime for a
number of days during the time of data collection. This
is not always the case during other time periods.

4. Conclusion
Adoption of a zero-emission vehicle ﬂeet is a critical com-
ponent to reducing carbon emissions in the transportation
sector. We need diversity of ZEV technologies in the ﬂeet to
satisfy the concerns of different segments of consumers. In
the case of FCVs, consumers need to trust that they would
have reliable fueling infrastructure before they purchase the
vehicle. Monitoring of station performance would, therefore,
provide transparency to customers and help policymakers
to ﬁx issues as they arise.
We show the use of unsupervised temporal clustering algo-Unsupervised Temporal Clustering to Monitor the Performance of Alternative Fueling Infrastructure
rithm to determine hydrogen refueling station performance
based on station capacity time-series data. The survey re-
sponses we obtained helped to understand the reasons be-
hind our cluster categories. The analysis presented in this
paper is for a static snapshot of time, hence, a machine
learning algorithm is not strictly necessary as we could have
obtained the same results through a heuristic. However, Cal-
ifornia plans on expanding the number of stations to about
200 stations in the year 2025, which increases the spatial
and temporal complexity of the data. Therefore, a simple
heuristic may fail to capture the utilization of these stations
and a machine learning algorithm demonstrated in this paper
may be necessary.
Even though the analysis presented in this paper focuses
on a static snapshot of time, this approach could be imple-
mented as a continuous monitoring effort with real-time
streaming of station capacity data. Finally, we are releasing
the hourly station capacity dataset that we collected for the
machine learning researchers to further explore temporal
and spatiotemporal projects.
