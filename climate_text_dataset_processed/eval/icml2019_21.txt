Abstract
One of the most pressing questions in climate sci-
ence is that of the effect of anthropogenic1aerosol
on the Earth’s energy balance. Aerosols provide
the ‘seeds’ on which cloud droplets form, and
changes in the amount of aerosol available to a
cloud can change its brightness and other physi-
cal properties such as optical thickness and spatial
extent. Clouds play a critical role in moderating
global temperatures and small perturbations can
lead to signiﬁcant amounts of cooling or warm-
ing. Uncertainty in this effect is so large it is
not currently known if it is negligible, or pro-
vides a large enough cooling to largely negate
present-day warming by CO2. This work uses
deep convolutional neural networks to look for
two particular perturbations in clouds due to an-
thropogenic aerosol and assess their properties
and prevalence, providing valuable insights into
their climatic effects.
1. Introduction
The planetary energy balance (between incoming and out-
going radiation), and hence global temperature, is very sen-
sitive to the properties and distribution of clouds in the
atmosphere. In turn, the properties of clouds depend on the
availability of condensation nuclei in the form of aerosol
(Lohmann et al., 2016). An increase in aerosol particles,
due to human activity for example, generally enhances the
number of small cloud droplets for a given amount of liquid
water. Smaller droplets are more reﬂective and so increase
the albedo of the cloud (Twomey, 1974). These effects

1A term commonly used in climate science to mean caused by
human activity.are difﬁcult to observe though because they are small com-
pared to the other main drivers of cloud formation, such
as moisture convergence and the availability of condens-
able water. These changes also affect the availability of
aerosol, and clouds themselves change, remove, and even
produce aerosol, creating complex feedbacks which are hard
to disentangle.
One approach to tackle this problem is by looking for strong
local aerosol perturbations in otherwise clean environments,
ideally with slowly varying cloud properties. Ship tracks
- tracks of cloud made brighter than their surroundings by
ship emissions, provide ideal cases (Christensen & Stephens,
2011). Finding and analysing these tracks is, however, a
laborious and time-consuming process, and hence no global
long-term databases of these important phenomena exist.
Another, even less well understood, process by which
changes in aerosol amount can change cloud properties is
the so called lifetime effect. Cloud droplets will start to pre-
cipitate once they reach a certain critical diameter, usually
around 14 m. All other things being equal, a smaller distri-
bution of cloud droplets can delay the onset of precipitation
in a cloud, potentially enhancing its lifetime and fractional
area (Albrecht, 1989). This acts to increase the albedo of
the cloud further, potentially creating a large cooling effect
(relative to the unperturbed cloud) (Boucher et al., 2013).
Large continuous decks of stratocumulus (Sc) clouds occur
in the cold upwelling regions of the major oceans and play a
crucial role in the global energy balance because of their size
and persistence. However, an important phenomena occurs
where a large region of the cloud deck dissipates through
the onset of precipitation and leaves open regions, so called
Pockets of Open Cells (POCs) (Stevens et al., 2005). It has
been hypothesized that these occurrences could be affected
by anthropogenic activity, speciﬁcally through aerosol per-
turbations delaying or even inhibiting their onset and caus-
ing a large cooling effect through the mechanisms described
above (Rosenfeld et al., 2006). Hence, POCs could have
important implications for climate change. Again how-
ever, besides from a handfull of small-scale case studies, no
database of POC occurrence exists.
Here we present a method of automatically detecting ship
tracks and POCs in 140 TB of high resolution satellite im-Detecting anthropogenic cloud perturbations with deep learning
agery using deep convolutional neural networks. This model
is then run over many years of satellite data producing a
unique database of observations that allows detailed studies
of the probability of their occurrence in different regions
and physical conditions. These implications will feed back
into regional and global assessments of their effect on global
cloud forcing.
The following section will outline the data used and method-
ology developed for the detection of these phenomena, be-
fore moving on to a presentation of the main ﬁndings so
far in Section 3. We conclude with a discussion of the
implications of our work and an outlook in Section 4.
2. Methodology
2.1. Data
All of the data used in the methods outlined below were
obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrom-
eter (MODIS) instruments on the NASA Aqua and Terra
(MODIS Science Team) satellites. The Level 1B data sets
were used which provide calibrated and geolocated radi-
ances at-aperture for all 36 MODIS spectral bands at 1km
resolution. Due to the different scales and properties of the
two different phenomena, however, the data were prepared
independently. The models used are also slightly different
in each case, though in the future we hope to combine them
into a single model.
For the ship track detection dataset, the original imager
reﬂectances from Channels 1, 20 and 32 (corresponding
to wavelengths of 645nm, 3.75 m and 12 m respectively)
were combined into a three-channel false-color compos-
ite. This composite was designed to provide information in
the visible (towards the middle of the solar spectrum), the
near-infrared (which provides information about the cloud
droplet size) and the infra-red (which allows discrimination
of cloud liquid and ice). The original 1350x2030 pixel im-
ages were split into 12 440x440 pixel padded images to
reduce the size of image used in training, while maintaining
the full 1km resolution. The training data was provided in
the form of 4,500 hand-logged tracks (Segrin et al., 2007;
Toll et al., 2017; Christensen & Stephens, 2012) which were
interpolated and converted into pixel masks for use in train-
ing the model. An example image and the corresponding
hand-logged data is shown in Fig. 1b.
For the POC detection dataset, the micro-physical properties
of the cloud were less important and a true-color RGB com-
posite was used from channels 1, 4 and 3 (corresponding to
wavelengths of 645nm, 555nm and 469nm respectively). We
use SatPy (Raspaud et al., 2018) to prepare the composite
images from the raw HDF4 dataﬁles. Due to the relatively
large size of the features and to speed up training the images
were rescaled from 1350x2030 pixels to 648x1296 and then(a)

split in two to create images 648x648 in size, which were
then further rescaled to 224x224 to match ResNet-152. The
training dataset was created by hand-logging 1029 images
which contained 715 POCs (as shown in Fig. 1a).
2.2. Model
Both of the models used are based on ResUnet architecture
which has shown good performance in remote observation
settings (Zhang et al., 2017).
The ship-track detection model currently uses the ResUnet
model with a binary cross-entropy loss function and train it
over 100 epochs. We use the Adam optimization (Kingma
& Ba, 2014) with a step-down in the learning rate from 1e-5
to a minimum of 5e-7 in fractional steps of 0.2 when the
loss plateaus. While this model shows some qualitative skill,
as shown in Fig. 1b, at the time of writing training and
development was still ongoing.
The POC detection model uses a modiﬁed ResNet-152
whose dense layers have been removed and replaced by
three up-sampling blocks based on the second half of the
ResUnet model used for the ship-track detection. The
ResNet-152 portion of the model had been pre-trained on
ImageNet, since this gives strong texture recognition, which
is important in this case as the different cloud structures
give very different textures. The upsampling blocks were
trained using the Adam optimization algorithm and step-
down learning rate from 0.001 with fractional steps of 0.2.
The loss function used was the DICE coefﬁcient, as it is
robust to class imbalance and gave very good results in test-
ing. The ﬁnal masks were reﬁned using a reduced ResUnet
model that was trained in the same way as the ResNet-152
model. The model obtains a precision score of 0.73 on the
test set, but visually performs extremely well. 8,491 POCsDetecting anthropogenic cloud perturbations with deep learning

were found in the 25,582 ﬁles on which the model was run,
creating the largest dataset of this phenomenon to date.
3. POC Results and Analysis
By applying the POC detection model to all of the MODIS
images which intersect the main Sc regions off the coast of
California, Peru and Namibia we are able to build a large
database of the temporal and spatial distribution of POCs
and their properties. Here we breiﬂy summarise their main
characteristics.
Figure 2 shows the density of POCs in each of the main
Sc regions, normalized by the number of images used and
the climatological fraction of Sc (Schiffer & Rossow, 1983).
Both the Californian and Namibian POCs show highest
densities towards the edge of the cloud decks, whereas the
Peruvian POCs are more evenly spread across the deck. The
Peruvian Sc region also shows the highest number of POCs
overall. The temporal distribution of POCs shows a strong
seasonal cycle and peaks in the local winter, although POCs
in the Californian Sc deck also have a peak in northern
hemisphere summer (not shown).
A number of retrievals are performed on the raw MODISspectral radiances to determine cloud properties at each
pixel. By applying the inferred POC masks to the retrieved
MODIS cloud properties (MODIS Atmosphere Science
Team, 2015) we are able to build statistics about the POCs
and their surrounding environment. Using OpenCV (Brad-
ski, 2000) to extract regions of ﬁxed distance from each
POC we can plot the average properties as a function of
distance from all of the detected POCs. Figure 3 shows the
average retrieved cloud optical thickness for all of the POCs
binned as a function of distance from the POC boundary.
The increase in optical thickness inside the POC is clearly
evident and due to the reduction in liquid water content
through precipitation. The similarity between the three re-
gions is striking and implies a common mechanism driving
POC formation.
By combining the spatio-temporal distribution of POCs with
their average optical depth and an assumed cloud droplet
asymmetry parameter we are able to calculate the change
in albedo due to POCs (Stephens, 1994). Calculating a
global mean value and multiplying by the incident solar
ﬂux, we ﬁnd that POCs make a very small change to the
amount of energy reﬂected by the Sc, only 0.02 Wm 2.
Even if anthropogenic activity suppressed POC formation
completely the climate effect would be negligible compared
to a present day CO2 forcing of 1.7 Wm 2.
4. Conclusions and discussion
Automatically detecting, and even classifying, clouds in
satellite data is easy and done routinely, however the detec-
tion of perturbations in those clouds is more challenging. In
this work we have demonstrated the ﬁrst application of deep
convolutional neural networks in the detection of ship-tracks
and POCs. The detection of ship tracks provides positive
cases of the direct perturbation of clouds by anthropogenic
aerosol, while the detection of POCs provides clues about
the adjustments of clouds to these perturbations.
By running inference over all images from the MODIS
satellite intersecting the main Sc regions we have created
a database of the properties of 1000s of POCs and their
spatial and temporal characteristics. This has enabled a
global, long term analysis of these phenomena, which will
provide the keys to unlocking new understanding of the
conditions under which aerosols inﬂuence cloud physics
and ultimately the climate.
While the ship track model is currently still under develop-
ment, early results provide encouraging evidence that the
model has some skill and could be improved further using
some of the techniques developed for POC detection.
Looking forward, we hope to develop a single model which
is able to detect both these, and other cloud perturbations
in order to produce a global, open, database spanning moreDetecting anthropogenic cloud perturbations with deep learning
than a decade of satellite observations. This will prove
invaluable in our efforts to better constrain the effects of
aerosol on clouds and their overall contribution to anthro-
pogenic climate change.
