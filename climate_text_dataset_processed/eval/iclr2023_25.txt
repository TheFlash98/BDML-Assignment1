ABSTRACT
Satellite altimeter observations retrieved since 1993 show that the global mean
sea level is rising at an unprecedented rate (3.4mm/year). With almost three
decades of observations, we can now investigate the contributions of anthro-
pogenic climate-change signals such as greenhouse gases, aerosols, and biomass
burning in this rising sea level. We use machine learning (ML) to investigate fu-
ture patterns of sea level change. To understand the extent of contributions from
the climate-change signals, and to help in forecasting sea level change in the fu-
ture, we turn to climate model simulations. This work presents a machine learning
framework that exploits both satellite observations and climate model simulations
to generate sea level rise projections at a 2-degree resolution spatial grid, 30 years
into the future. We train fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) to predict
altimeter values through a non-linear fusion of the climate model hindcasts (for
1993-2019). The learned FCNNs are then applied to future climate model pro-
jections to predict future sea level patterns. We propose segmenting our spatial
dataset into meaningful clusters and show that clustering helps to improve predic-
tions of our ML model.
1 I NTRODUCTION
With melting ice sheets and the growing warmth of the ocean water, the global mean sea level is
rising at an extraordinary rate and is accelerating (0.08mm/year2) [17]. While, on average, the sea
level has risen 10 cm over the last 30 years, there is a considerable variation in the regional rates of
the sea level change [11]. These regional patterns are richer in information and can be very useful
in examining the impact of climate-driven factors including greenhouse gases, industrial aerosols,
and biomass burning in the sea level change. Studies in [5; 6; 7] have found the regional variations
to be linked to aerosols and greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying how regional trends will evolve
in the future is also beneficial for socioeconomic planning. Our work investigates the sea level at a
2-degree or 180 x 90 (longitude x latitude) spatial resolution.
Now that there are almost three decades of satellite altimeter records or observations1, we want to
explore the rising rate of the sea level further and investigate how much of this rise can be attributed
to climate-change signals. To do this, we turn to the climate models in order to provide a better
understanding of the altimeter data and to help in forecasting future sea level change by learning
more about the extent of the causal contributions from such factors. A climate model uses math-
ematical equations to simulate complex physical and chemical processes of Earth systems such as
the atmosphere, land, ocean, ice, and solar energy [8]. A recent study by Fasullo and Nerem (2018)
with two climate model large ensembles showed that the forced responses of greenhouse gas and

aerosols have begun to emerge in the altimeter data patterns. This motivates us to include climate
models in designing our machine learning (ML) pipeline.
Our goal is to generate sea level projections 30 years into the future and at a 2-degree spatial res-
olution utilizing the altimeter data as well as climate model simulations. Some past works have
used satellite altimeter data and adopted ML techniques to perform sea level prediction. While
tide-gauge data has also been used for similar tasks, satellite altimetry provides nearly global cover-
age. Braakmann-Folgmann et al. (2017) used a combination of CNN + ConvLSTM layers to perform
interannual sea level anomalies (SLA) prediction over the Pacific Ocean. [20] work with LSTM for
South China Sea. In [1], the authors include ocean-atmospheric features like sea surface tempera-
ture, salinity, surface atmospheric pressure to build support vector and LSTM models for the West
Peninsular Malaysia coastline. [18] make use of gaussian processes and LSTM to predict sea level
variation along the regional coastal zones. In [12], they compare various machine learning tech-
niques to predict global mean sea level rise. However, none of these models go so far as to forecast
sea level change 30years in advance. They also do not produce forecasts for the entire globe. Our
work addresses the problem at a much bigger spatial scale that includes all the oceans and a much
longer time horizon in the future. Our framework utilizes climate models to understand the causal
effects of climate-change signals. We add interpretability to our model by explaining the contribu-
tions of the climate model ensembles. We also present a way to segment spatial data and show the
performance of our method for predicting the sea rise trend. We do a quantitative evaluation of the
predictions on the past data and introduce a qualitative analysis of the predictions on the future data
while also producing uncertainty estimates associated with the ML prediction.
Pathways to Climate Impact Forecasting long-term sea level change is a complex problem given
the natural variability of the ocean, the wide range of processes involved, and complex non-linear
interactions playing a role in the sea level change. Through our work, we show the potential of
machine learning in producing these forecasts 30 years in advance and over all oceans at a reasonably
good spatial resolution. This is a promising step towards understanding the impact of climate change
on the current sea level rise and how it can influence its future course. The longer horizon prediction
in the future can be vital in providing us with more time to plan and adapt to the rising sea level.
2 D ATASET AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
Figure 1: Figure shows the sea level trend maps for the 6 climate model ensembles (on left) and satellite
altimeter data (on right) for the period 1993-2019. Here the trend values are visualized in mm/year.
Our altimeter dataset is a monthly sea surface height (SSH) data at 1/4-degree spatial resolution
for the time period 1993-2019. For the same duration, we obtain monthly SSH at 1-degree spatial
resolution from 6 different climate model ensembles. They are: CESM1 (large ensemble) [13],
CESM2 (large ensemble) [3], MPIGE [15], GFDLESM2M [4], MPI-ESM1-2-HR [16] and MPI-
ESM1-2-LR [10]. Model simulations for individual members of the model ensembles are averaged

to create the sea surface height (SSH) variable we work with. The spatial SSH fields for both the
altimeter data and climate models are regridded to a 2 degree, i.e a 180x90 grid (as it speeds up the
computation while still keeping a reasonable resolution), and their global mean is removed as well.
For every ocean grid point, a linear trend is fitted to the monthly SSH time series for the 1993-2019
time period. This way, we obtain a single trend map, for all the climate model ensembles and the
altimeter (see Figure 1). Working with trends helps to avoid the monthly variability of the SSH
fields. This can be beneficial to our machine learning model as removing other variabilities can help
it to learn from the climate-change signals better.
We flattened the spatial grid to create our dataset. For every ocean lat/long there is a trend (in
cm/year) provided by each of the 6 climate models, comprising the input (X) and also from the
altimeter (ground truth), which is the label (Y) for our ML training. We frame our problem as
a supervised machine learning task that utilizes both climate model hindcast trends, and altimeter
trend while absorbing the biases that the climate models have away from the altimeter data. Figure 1
shows that the climate models don’t reproduce the trend pattern in altimeter data very well and
they also disagree with each other substantially. There is also a difference in variability between
the altimeter and the climate models as can be observed in Figure 1 and we expect our method to
address this. It is worth noting that we do not have altimeter records for all the latitudes. They are
roughly present for latitudes [ ´70to +70] that give us 7,643data points excluding land grid points.
While we have access to long periods of climate model simulations in the past as well as the fu-
ture, our learning setup as described in [19] using an UNet-based spatiotemporal forecasting model
trained on the climate model dataset did not perform very well in forecasting on the altimeter data.
This is expected as there is a lot more variability in the altimeter trend as compared to the climate
models (Figure 1). Moreover, with just a single altimeter trend map (1993-2019), we are limited
by the data in the temporal dimension. This motivated us to exploit a reasonably dense spatial data
instead and formulate our problem as described above.
3 M ETHOD
Our supervised machine learning pipeline is trained for the period 1993-2019. We get the supervi-
sion from the altimeter trend and inputs or features to our ML model is provided by the 6 climate
model hindcast trends for the same time period. In the inference phase, we predict trend projections
for 30 years later. This is done by taking the climate model projected trends for 2023-2049 and
passing them through the learned ML model to produce a projected altimeter trend. Our ML model
is a fully connected neural network (FCNN) trained with mean squared error (MSE) as the loss. The
MSE is weighted where the weights are the abspcosineqof the latitude of the grid points to give less
weight to polar regions as compared to other regions.
Clustering : We segment our spatial grid into clusters with various clustering methods and observe
the performance of the ML model when trained conditioned on these clusters i.e a separate FCNN
is trained for each cluster. The time series of the altimeter sea-surface height serves as the features
for K-means clustering and Spectral clustering. We also perform a clustering scheme that is derived
from our physical knowledge of the data (described in Figure 2). The spatial segmentations with
all three clustering approaches can be seen in Figure 2. These approaches are compared to each
other and also with a setup where the spatial grid is not segmented at all. We make use of k-fold
cross-validation (k=5) to choose the best hyperparameters for each cluster, ending up with different
FCNN architectures per cluster. To elaborate further, each of the red and purple clusters in the
spectral clustering setting as seen in Figure 2(b), learns an FCNN consisting of 3 hidden layers with
1024, 512, and 256 neurons respectively. For each of the other two smaller clusters, we use an
FCNN with 2 hidden layers and 256, 128 neurons respectively.
4 R ESULTS
We report different metrics for past and future time periods.
1) 1993-2019 (with ground truth available) : We show the RMSE scores for the three cluster-
ing approaches and a no clustering setup (Table 1). Table 1 also shows the Pearson correlation
scores between the ML predicted trend and the true altimeter trend for 1993-2019. Comparing their
cross-validation scores (as described in 3) also gives a similar performance order. The RMSE and

tering derived from our physical understanding where the North Atlantic Ocean is assigned a single cluster,
latitudes from south up to -30 are assigned another cluster and the rest belong to the 3rd cluster.
correlation scores are weighted as described in 3. We observe that K-means Clustering outperforms
others. Kmeans andSpectral have similar scores, this may be due to the fact that they have al-
most similar clusters except for a very small segmented region in the Southern Ocean in the spectral
clusters. Their scores are also better than the Hardcoded clustering andNo clustering . We also
examine each of the segmented regions by looking at each cluster’s RMSE and correlation scores.
Table 1: Table comparing the performance in
terms of weighted RMSE (in mm/year) and cor-
relation for the clustering methods for 1993-2019.
Method RMSE ÓCorrelationÒ
No Clustering 0.57 0.9
Spectral Clustering 0.48 0.93
K-means Clustering 0.44 0.93
Hardcoded Clustering 0.55 0.89We derive more insights by visualizing the dif-
ference map between the true trend and predic-
tion. The North Atlantic and Southern Ocean
in general show higher differences. Some of
the higher difference zones in the map could be
caused by ocean eddies. Our ML model’s per-
formance is much better in the Pacific, which is
significant as it is a crucial area for socioeco-
nomic impacts.
Interpretability: In order to add interpretabil-
ity to the models, we use SHAP [14] values to
explain the contributions of the climate model
ensembles which are feature inputs to our FCNNs. For Kmeans andSpectral clustering , on the
”red” cluster of Figure 2(a,b) (which we are most interested in) SHAP values indicate the climate
model CESM1 (large ensemble) to be the most important, followed by CESM2 (large ensemble)
and MPIGE.
2) 2023-2049 : It is harder to gauge the performance of any ML method without the ground truth.
In this case, we do a qualitative analysis of the predicted trend in terms of cumulative variability and
we expect our ML models to predict trends with variability similar to the variability of the 1993-
2019 altimeter trend. We take the root mean square (RMS) of the trend to quantify the notion of
variability in the trend. Figure 3(a) shows that the altimeter trend from 1993-2019 (which is referred
to as persistence in climate literature) has a very high variability (1.28mm/year) . In figure 3(b), we
show the future trend predictions obtained from the K-means clustering model and inspect its vari-
ability. Figure 3(b) shows a high variability (1.24mm/year) in our predicted trend for 2023-2049,
though it is still lesser than the altimeter trend variability of the past. If we look at the predicted
variability concerning other clustering methods, we found that all of them including Hardcoded
clustering predictions showed a higher variability (1.21mm/year) compared to the No clustering set-
ting (0.99mm/year). This analysis strengthens our hypothesis to segment the spatial grid and learn
an ML model conditioned on each segmented region for more optimal predictions that can capture
better variability.
Model uncertainty: Additionally, our framework provides uncertainty over the predictions given
by the ML model. Our FCNN model includes dropout layers to reduce overfitting while training.
We use the Monte Carlo dropout [9] approach where in the inference phase, we perform multiple
forward passes (with different dropout masks) through our ML model and report the mean of the
ensemble of predictions as the prediction outcome and their standard deviation as the model uncer-
tainty (this is shown in Figure 3(c)).

shows the ML model uncertainty in terms of the standard deviation (mm/year).
Fully connected neural networks learn to map climate model projections to future trends and their
superior performance, especially in the Pacific Ocean shows promise in this application. K-means
clustering is found to have the lowest training RMSE, but the predictions generated for the future
have lower variability as compared to the altimeter persistence. We need to investigate this further
as we expect to see an increase in trend variability in the future that aligns with the climate model
projections for 2023-2049 that show an increased variability as compared to their 30 years’ past
values. We plan to use spatial smoothening2to our altimeter data to counter the influence of small-
scale ocean eddies and potentially produce predictions with higher variability. The domain experts
in our team will also analyze the ML model predictions and uncertainty further and compare it
across all the clustering approaches. Our initial results look promising, furthering the need for more
research on anthropogenic climate change and how it can impact future sea level rise.
