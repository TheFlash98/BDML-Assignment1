Abstract
The acceleration in the effects of global warming and the recent turbu-
lences in the energy market are further highlighting the need to act quicker
and smarter in terms of decisions to transition to greener energy and re-
duce our overall energy consumption. With buildings accounting for about
40% of the energy consumption in Europe, it is crucial to have a com-
prehensive understanding of the building stock and their energy-related
characteristics, including their age, in order to make informed decisions for
energy savings. This study introduces a novel way to approach the age
estimation of buildings at scale, using a machine learning method that in-
tegrates satellite-based imagery with morphological features of buildings.
The findings demonstrate the benefits of combining these data sources and
underscore the importance of incorporating local data to enable accurate
prediction across different cities.
1 Introduction
Buildings are significant contributors of the carbon emissions at global scale and particularly
in Europe (Economidou et al., 2011). Supporting policy makers in developing legislation,
propose concrete actions and monitor results to decarbonise the building stock, access to
high-resolution building data is essential. Furthermore, it is estimated that 40 million Eu-
ropeans were unable to heat their homes on 2022 (Eurostat, 2023), underscoring the critical
importance of directing investments to where they are most needed. Therefore, transitioning
from broad measures that benefit the majority to more informed decisions based on detailed
data is imperative.
Access to building and energy-related data necessary for effective policy design at the Euro-
pean level is often limited or inconsistent. Information about buildings in the EU is typically
available as aggregated statistics, such as the Building Stock Observatory (BSO) (Commis-
sion, 2016-2023) and Hotmaps (Pezzutto et al., 2018), or as coarse raster maps from the
Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) (Pesaresi, 2023). However, there is a need to
identify buildings at the individual unit level. Recent efforts in this direction include the
publicly available EUBUCCO (Milojevic-Dupont et al., 2023) , DBSM (Florio et al., 2023),
and Overture (Foundation, 2023) databases. The construction period of a building is a
crucial indicator for gaining a better understanding of its energy-related characteristics and
estimate its energy performance.
Three primary open and public data sources currently provide information on the construc-
tion age of individual buildings. The first source is OpenStreetMap (OSM), which offers
sparse and unevenly distributed coverage of the EU with crowdsourced information (Con-
tributors, 2022), as can be seen in Figure 1a. The second source is the combination of
cadastral sources by GISCO from EUSTAT, which is currently restricted to large parts of
Spain, France, and The Netherlands (Gisco, 2023), as shown in Figure 1b. Lastly, EU-
BUCCO covers 200 million buildings in EU countries, with 24% including the building

age. This data encompasses ∼50M individual buildings, primarily distributed across five
countries: France ( ∼21.5M buildings), Spain ( ∼16M buildings), the Netherlands ( ∼10M
buildings), Italy ( ∼1.5M buildings), and Finland ( ∼50K buildings). The data was obtained
from national cadastral and municipal datasets.

In the literature, various methodologies have been proposed for deriving the age of buildings.
Li et al. (2018) and Zeppelzauer et al. (2018) utilized Deep Learning models to estimate
building age from non-openly available images sourced from Google Street View images,
real estate evaluation reports, and web platforms. Garbasevschi et al. (2021) adopted a
different approach, training a Random Forest classification model based on visual features
of buildings, including geometric attributes and location-contextual information for selected
cities in Germany. The most recent methodology, introduced by Nachtigall et al. (2023),
demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale building age prediction using morphology features.
The objective of our study is to derive an initial estimate of building construction age
at the EU scale using openly available datasets. To achieve this, we aim to utilize non-
commercial data and methodologies capable of scaling up, particularly those reliant on
Earth Observation data. In this paper, we employ a traditional machine learning algorithm
to integrate multi-temporal built-up surface grid rom the GHSL Global Human Settlement
Layer and morphological features extracted from OSM. Our study demonstrates that this
combined approach yields superior results compared to using either data source in isolation.
2 Methodology
A novel solution has been developed, integrating data on the age of building construction
obtained from satellite imagery from the GHSL and morphological features derived from
OSM. These two streams of information are combined using a supervised machine learning
model to estimate the age of building construction.
2.1 Age of construction from GSHL multi-temporal built-up surface grid
The GHSL Global Human Settlement Layer project (European Commission, 2023) offers
comprehensive global spatial data on human presence on the planet. Their products en-
compass built-up maps, population density maps, and settlement maps, among others. One
of their key products is the multi-temporal built-up surface grid GHS-BUILT-S(Pesaresi,
2023), which is based on a series of temporally spaced-out Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery
that tracks the development of settlement growth over time. By comparing the relative
difference in built-up areas between observations, insights into the age of added built-up
areas can be gained, allowing for the identification of buildings constructed between 1975
and 2020. The resolution is harmonized to 100m, which restricts the ability to identify
individual buildings or small additions. However, this approach aims to balance accuracy
and biases over the entire age range. The GHS-BUILT-S provides consistent distribution
of built-up surfaces in 5-year intervals. The process involves first identifying built-up areas
in the Sentinel-2 image composite for year 2018 (Corbane et al., 2020) and then checking

the blocks of identified built-up areas in subsequent steps. However, this approach has lim-
itations, as it can only capture increases in built-up areas and cannot detect reductions,
and it is unable to identify building areas that are re-built or renovated. Nevertheless, the
advantage of this method is that it provides coverage at a global scale.
The subtraction of consecutive 5-year images from GHSL was performed to extract the most
probable age of construction of a building, as illustrated in Figure 2.
2.2 Morphological features from OpenStreetMap
The morphological features extracted to drive the prediction of building age are shown in
Table 1, based on the most significant ones identified by Nachtigall et al. (2023):
Building features Neighbourhood features
Shape Complexity Distance to closest neighbour
House element count Number of adjoining buildings
House area Distances to closest street and intersection
Building count in 20m, 100m and 500 range
Table 1: Morphological predictive features derived from OSM.
Building age labels for model training are also extracted from OSM, which are considered
to be the closest to ground truth in this case (Figure 1a). The Netherlands stands out with
the highest number of buildings with this information. Additionally, we observed that the
samples are not representative in countries with a small number of labels, such as Italy, as
most of them correspond to churches or other historic buildings. As a result, we have chosen
to focus on two cities in The Netherlands for our feasibility study, specifically Amsterdam
and Rotterdam. Amsterdam boasts a total of 249,546 buildings, and the building age
distribution is presented in Table 2.

3 Experimental Results
We trained a Random Forest model on 80% of the available data for Amsterdam. The
confusion matrix in Figure 3a illustrates the model’s performance on the test set from the
remaining 20% of the data when using all predictive attributes, including information from
GHS-BUILT-S multi-temporal built-up surface grid and morphological features derived from
OSM. Upon removing GHS-BUILT-S features, performance deteriorates across all classes,
as demonstrated in Figure 3b. Additionally, Figure 3c shows that when only GHS-BUILT-S
features are utilized, the performance is not as robust as when all features are considered,
but it is also not as poor as when only morphological attributes are considered.

phological features

cal features

tures
We are particularly interested in exploring the model’s ability to generalize to other geo-
graphic locations. To this end, we have chosen Rotterdam as an additional test case. After
training a separate model for Rotterdam using a balanced dataset, we observed that with-
out considering any labels or training data from Amsterdam, the model’s performance in
predicting the age of buildings in Amsterdam was notably poor. However, when a small
amount of local data from Amsterdam (10% of available data) was used to re-train the
model, the prediction capability increased, with an accuracy of 73 .8%. Notably, when only
5% of the available data from Amsterdam was included in Rotterdam’s model, the accuracy
decreased to 67 .3%. This finding is significant, as it reflects the challenge of limited data
availability for building age across most geographical areas.

4 Conclusion
This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of combining satellite and morphological fea-
tures for predicting the age of buildings using Machine Learning. Our feasibility study
integrated the multi-temporal built-up surface grid from GHS-BUILT-S and various mor-
phological features from OSM in a Random Forest model. As expected, the model exhibited
strong local predictability, showing sensitivity to the use of local data, particularly from dif-
ferent cities within the same country. Notably, we observed that incorporating a small
amount of local information could enhance prediction accuracy for a different location.
We view this work as an initial exploration into the combination of satellite and morpholog-
ical features, aiming to provide a scalable solution for EU coverage. Further investigation is
needed to better understand the over-prediction of pre-1950 buildings, test the model’s gen-
eralization capability to other countries, and explore the use of other ML algorithms, such
as graph neural networks, which consider spatial relations of the data. In future models,
reference data could also be extracted from EUBUCCO and EUSTAT sources.
Moreover, for energy-related purposes, it is crucial to have information on the age of renova-
tion, if any. Hence, this data should be combined with information from energy performance
certificates in the future. We recognize that data availability in terms of geographical cov-
erage in OSM is not uniform, even for extracting morphological features. However, we

address this limitation and enhance data availability.
