Abstract
This study addresses the challenge of predicting electric vehicle (EV) charging
profiles in urban locations with limited data. Utilizing a neural network architecture,
we aim to uncover latent charging profiles influenced by spatio-temporal factors.
Our model focuses on peak power demand and daily load shapes, providing insights
into charging behavior. Our results indicate significant impacts from the type of
Basic Administrative Units on predicted load curves, which contributes to the
understanding and optimization of EV charging infrastructure in urban settings and
allows Distribution System Operators (DSO) to more efficiently plan EV charging
infrastructure expansion.
1 Introduction and motivation
One of the major pushes to fight climate change is the decarbonization of energy and mobility, which
are closely related and together significantly contribute to global carbon emissions[ 8]. Within this
intersection, the electrification of mobility via large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) is
one of the potential tools to decarbonize mobility in the coming decades[1, 15].
This push, however, requires significant investment in power infrastructure, mainly on the distribution
level operated by distribution system operators (DSOs)[ 5,4]. This is due to the need to expand the

loads across space and time[6, 13].
Since power engineering infrastructure expansion is an effort requiring significant time and financial
resources, a critical challenge in this area is how to optimize grid expansion for efficiency to cover
anticipated EV charging demand in various areas while not overloading the current network and
not overspending on areas where demand is not as high[ 11,14]. This is especially difficult for
DSOs since there has been a general lack of studies demonstrating analysis of real-world EV
charging data in different geographies, mainly due to the data being vendor-locked and treated as
confidential[2, 10, 11].
In this study, we aim to fill this critical gap by collaborating with PREdistribuce, the DSO in Prague,
and the largest operator of public EV chargers. We propose a method to generatively create anticipated
EV charging load curves based on location characteristics even in places where no chargers are
present, in order to allow for DSOs and the wider community to better understand and simulate public
EV charging behavior.
2 Generative modeling of public charging demand
In order to solve the challenge of predicting charging profiles for selected locations with limited
information, we first analyzed the information about the landscape of public chargers in Prague. Our
study is based on data sourced from public EV chargers operated by PREdistribuce, the DSO in the
Prague area.
We have gotten access to full logs of all charging sessions, including precise start and end times,
power consumption, type and power output of each charger, and their location. State of charge or
identification of individual vehicles was not available to us. We have paired this information with
other geographic and demographic data to complement our understanding of the individual charger
locations, based around the basic administrative units the chargers are located in. The public EV
charging landscape is further explored in Appendix A.
2.1 Model inputs
For the generative predictions of load curves, we have assessed several factors that might come into
play to affect charging loads[ 11]. In connection to the basic administrative units, we were able to
include several attributes that, in our opinion, are able to increase the performance of our model,
including the area character and the amounts of local and long-haul commuters. Firstly, to reflect the
character of the surrounding area, we include the basic administrative unit type, which includes 12
distinct categories ranging from residential to industrial. Secondly, to reflect local commuting, we
include population density per the administrative unit and the local number of addresses, including
industrial and commercial buildings, per the corresponding basic administrative unit. Thirdly, we
have further enhanced this data to include information on vehicles commuting to the wider area of
town to reflect long-haul commuting factors. In connection to the charging data, we have performed
additional analysis of charging load data, uncovering insights that may be found in Appendix B
2.2 Model architecture
There are two distinct, yet related components that DSOs are interested in, the first being peak power
demand and the second being the actual load shape during the day [ 9,7]. Moreover, our hypothesis is
that, in general, there exist Kunderlying archetypal charging profiles, which are mixed by factors
depending on the spatiotemporal properties of a charging station. Once enough data flows into the
model given by a neural network, our aim is to interpret and examine those profiles and how the
mixture factors depend on particular spatiotemporal settings.
In order to reflect those criteria and with an emphasis on gaining a deeper understanding of charging
behavior, by introducing latent charging profiles, we have chosen a neural network with the archi-
tecture shown in Figure 1. As seen in the figure, there are two distinct modules: the g module is
tasked with predicting peak load, and the f module is used to predict the load shape. As shown in
the figure on the right, the g module is trained to predict the total power scalar l, and the f module
predicts the probabilities of the Kunderlying archetypal latent charging curves R, which are shown
2on the left. Each of them has 24 values, representing the load curve distribution over 24 hours. The
resulting predicted load curves for each charger and corresponding set of inputs described above is a
combination of these latent profiles, determined by a ratio output by the f module and then multiplied
by a scalar lto determine the peak load, which is the output of the g module .
As a base scenario, we have run our experiment with the parameters as described in Appendix C,
notably making the assumption that there are 4 underlying latent profiles that might be attributed to
archetypal behavior.

3 Results
Using the described experimental setup, we can examine the generated load profiles in Figure 2. It
was our hypothesis that the model would be able to decompose the input parameter influences and
assign them to latent load curves representing archetypal behavior. After some experimenting, we
have chosen K= 4latent profiles in this initial study. Since the generated load curves differ from
each other starkly, it appears the model works as intended.
A basic interpretation of the generated latent load profiles is that latent curve 1 shows a gradual
charging curve with a peak during the day, typical for public charging. The latent curve 2 shows
a single morning peak demand, and the latent curve 3 shows a single evening demand, which is
generally more typical for private charging. Lastly, latent curve 4 shows a residual demand with
multiple peaks. What are the causes of these archetypal behaviors is a topic of further research,
3however, if we follow our hypothesis more in-depth, we may also relate the emergent load curves in
the context of observed area charging specificity described in Appendix B.1.
When comparing to the generated load profiles observed here, we can see similar load profiles coming
out of the original charging data matched to types of basic administrative units. If we were to make
this connection speculatively, it creates an implication that the latent curve 1 might represent the
local, residential charging archetypal behavior, latent curve 2 might represent recreational commute,
latent curve 3 suburban and long-range commute, and latent curve 4 might correspond to irregular
industrial and commercial commute. Based on this connection, it appears that out of the assembled
input data, the strongest impact on the predicted load curves is held by the type of the local basic
administrative unit.
Figure 2: These 4 plots showcase trained latent load curve shapes within the neural network archi-
tecture. Note that the latent profiles are probability distributions, and thus the sum of the area they
define is equal to 1.
4 Conclusion and further work
In this study, we have introduced a novel approach to creating a machine learning based model which
allows for generative creation of public EV charging load profiles in various urban geographies given
a wide range of input data. Our method is designed to create internal latent charging profiles, which
have the potential to better explain the sources of charging demand if interpreted in connection with
archetypal behaviors. In our results, we have offered such an interpretation based on available data
analysis.
Our proposed model has the potential to assist DSOs and the wider research community in better
modelling public charging demand, model different potential future scenarios, and in the case of
DSOs, create more efficient strategies to expand EV charging grid infrastructure and support the EV
number increase and its wider accessibility while keeping unexpected grid impacts to a minimum.
Our model is still undergoing further refinement and there are some limitations to acknowledge.
Firstly, we aim to include more data in our future iteration, as our current data has a cutoff in 2022 as
described in Appendix A.2. Connected to this, further investigation is needed to understand what
effect the COVID pandemic lockdowns had on our input data, since as shown in Appendix B.5, the
decrease in total load was significant. We are also continuing our research in the interpretability of
the charging load profile sources, facilitated in our model via the latent archetypal load shapes, with
the interpretation being speculative. An alternative approach might be to strictly separate types of
inputs to be used for each latent load shape. Lastly, we invite the broader community to apply similar
approaches to different geographies to cross-reference our findings.

5A Prague EV public charging landscape
A.1 Prague area classification per basic administrative unit
In order to analyse the potential factors affecting charging demand, we have to understand the environment in
which individual charging points are located. For this aim, we have utilized the enhanced "multi" layer of Basic
Administrative Units (Základní sídelní jednotka, ZSJ), as provided by the Czech Statistical Office[ 3]. The ZSJ is
the smallest administrative unit available, and there are 948 individual units in Prague. Using this data, we have
been able to classify individual ZSJ areas in Prague into 12 categories, as seen in Figure 3.
Figure 3: ZSJ categories found in Prague proper
Since the names for ZSJ categories are standardised in Czech, table 1 shows English translations and a colour-
coded legend for the following figures.

6A.2 Charging demand localization in Prague
The data on individual charging sessions was kindly provided by Prague’s largest provider of public charging
points, PREdistribuce[ 12]. Figure 4 shows a visualisation of charger locations within the ZSJ structure of Prague.
Figure 4: Heatmap of public charging point locations per ZSJ in Prague based on the available data.
We can see the broad distribution of public chargers across the city of Prague, with the largest concentration in
population centres, most notably the one at ˇCerný most in the top right of the map, with 12 chargers present in
one ZSJ. In Figure 5, we can see that most chargers in the dataset are placed in residential areas (70 chargers),
followed by civic amenities areas (34 chargers) and urban and suburban mixed areas (16 chargers). The other
categories of ZSJ areas have 3 or fewer chargers present.
Figure 5: Number of chargers per ZSJ category across Prague
7In Figure 6, the monthly relative total shares of each ZSJ area type are visualized for two key elements in
our dataset: charging instances and installed charging points. Note that for the charging instances dataset, no
datapoints are currently available to us between December 2020 and December 2021, as highlighted in the figure
by a red-bordered gray fill-in with interpolated data. We can see that the number of charging sessions in Compact
residential areas rose between the years 2019 and 2022. Simultaneously, a modest increase in the relative share
of charging instances can be observed in Agricultural and Industrial areas. Conversely, a decline in charging
instances share is evident in Civic amenities, Urban and suburban mixed, and Recreational areas. This decrease
could be attributed to various factors, such as changes in usage patterns or the availability of charging stations.
However, combined with the analysis of the share of installed charging stations on the lower plot, we can see
that the change in charging sessions relative shares for individual ZSJ area types described above are not directly
explainable by developments in the number of available chargers in the respective ZSJ types. Indeed, we can
see that while the two most dominant ZSJ types (residential areas and civic amenities areas, respectively) are
overrepresented in the number of charging instances, the suburban, recreational, transportation, and reserve areas
are greatly underrepresented in the charging instances relative to the number of available chargers. This observed
behavior may be caused by several characteristics of chargers in the dataset, such as accessibility, geographic
location, charging point alternatives, and others. Still, this discrepancy clearly implies a different behavioral
pattern for chargers in different ZSJ area types, which is examined next.
Figure 6: Temporal relative share development analysis for charging instances and installed chargers
in Prague, classified per ZSJ type. Note that the red-bordered gray fill area in the upper chart of
charging instances corresponds to the interpolated region of unavailable data, and the lower chart
of the number of installed chargers includes chargers put into operation before the span of the chart
timeline, December 2019.
8B Public charging load curve analysis
B.1 Load-curve analysis based on basic administrative unit type
We have investigated the specificity of ZSJ area types by plotting demand curves of EV charging split per
individual type. Figure 7 provides a visualization of the normalized average number of charging instances per
hour of day, which approximates load curve behavior patterns across different ZSJ area types. The analysis
clearly shows that demand patterns between different ZSJ types are heterogeneous. We see four distinct groups
emerge:
•Group 1: Sustained single peak areas demonstrate a sustained demand in charging instances with a
gradual single peak throughout the day, suggesting a consistent demand for charging facilities in these
areas. The following ZSJ types fall within this category:
–Compact residential area
–Urban and suburban mixed area
–Civic amenities area
•Group 2: Morning single peak areas exhibit a clear peak in the morning hours, around 8:00. The
following ZSJ types fall within this category:
–Transportation infrastructure area
–Recreational area
•Group 3: Evening single peak areas demonstrate a single peak in the evening, around 17:00. The
following ZSJ types fall within this category:
–Separated residential area
–Agricultural area
•Group 4: Double peak areas demonstrate both the morning peak and the evening peak, though
potentially shifted by an hour. The following ZSJ types fall within this category:
–Reserve area
–Industrial area
Figure 7: Normalized demand curves for ZSJ types with ndefined as number of charge points present
in the dataset for each ZSJ type
In the figure we compare data within time series or categories of inherently different volume, in categories of
locations with varying numbers of charging points, we have therefore utilized max normalization feature scaling.
It rescales all values of a non-negative data series to a maximal value of one, while retaining the relative distance
from zero. Normalized series and their characteristics are then directly comparable. The i-th element of the
series is rescaled as follows:
x′
i=xi
max( x)
9B.2 Average load curves per month and weekday
We have also observed trends in seasonality between weekdays and months as shown in Fig. 8. While no
significant load shape differences are found, we can observe marked lower demand on the weekends and in
summer months.
Figure 8: Comparing the average load curves and their confidence intervals for each weekday
(columns Monday to Friday) and month (rows January to December)
10B.3 Weekday analysis
Further delving into the differences between individual weekdays, in Fig. 9 we have shown individual load-curve
shapes between weekdays and weekends for a subset of chargers in the dataset. While weekends show generally
lower demand, high variability is also observed.
Figure 9: Comparing load curves for weekends (marked in blue) and weekdays (marked with red) for
a subsample of individual chargers
11B.4 Easter holiday analysis
Following our analysis in B.2 and B.3, we have examined what effect public holidays might have on charging,
by comparing the Easter holiday week average load curve with other weeks shown in Fig. 10, however no major
differences or anomalies were found.
Figure 10: Easter week average charging load curve in blue compared to average loads of standard
workweeks in green
B.5 COVID lockdown total load impact analysis
As shown in Fig. 11, COVID lockdowns in Prague after May 2020 have had a stark impact on general public
charging loads. The impact on our dataset is a topic of further research.
