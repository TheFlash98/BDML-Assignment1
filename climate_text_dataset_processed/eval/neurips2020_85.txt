1 Rising Sea Level and the Coastal Impact
Twentieth century has seen an overall sea-level rise of 0.5m [7, 11] and the studies for the twenty-Ô¨Årst
century [22, 10] project the overall increment within a range of 0.5m to 2m, considering high emission
scenarios and rapid melting of major Antarctic glaciers. Naturally this has a severe impact on a major
percentage of the population inhabiting coastal land zones [18], with a recent study [12] placing 110
million people living below the local high tide line. Of all the different coastline types, sandy shores,
forming 31% of the world‚Äôs beaches [14], undergo major erosion and accretion changes and hence
are of special focus in this paper. Because of these reasons, it is paramount to regularly monitor the
coastline changes across the world for better understanding, and to create necessary preparation and
mitigation strategies.
1.1 Status Quo: Coastline Monitoring via Satellite Imaging
Majority of remote-sensing datasets created in the past have been sourced from Sentinel and Landsat
satellites (10m and 30m resolution respectively), across a timespan of many decades. As an example
Luijendijk et al. [14] uses images from 32 years of capture since 1988. On top of this, when
traditional image processing techniques are applied over single images to estimate shorelines it results
in errors due to misalignment and time of capture. To address this issue, a moving average based
composite image approach presented by Hagenaars et al. [4] reduces the error margin to a half-pixel
precision value. Few other factors promoting the usage of remote sensing data are the ever-improving
sources of data both in terms of resolution and frequency of capture, and in-situ approaches like land
surveys being very difÔ¨Åcult and expensive to achieve.
A recent review paper by Toure et al. [20] categorizes the shoreline detection algorithms into:
Segmentation based approach: Using index like NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)
orSWI (SuperÔ¨Åne Water Index), followed by supervised and unsupervised approaches for
pixel-based classiÔ¨Åcation. A recent work by Yang et al. [23] has utilized deep learning
architecture for sea-land segmentation on Landsat images within a single geography.
Edge Detection based approach: These approaches work at a Ô¨Åner level to discern the precise
shoreline. Heene et al. [5] have utilized Canny edge detector followed by post-processing to
get the Ô¨Ånal shorelines, whereas Kass et al. [9] have proposed an active contour approach,
named Snake, to obtain initial set of edges that are further post-processed.
Band Thresholding methods: Aedla et al. [1] have proposed adaptive thresholding and its
variants, while Jishuang et al. [8] have used a threshold based morphological approach.
However, due to the availability of better modeling approaches, these are running out of
favor.

1.2 Our Goal
In order to estimate accurate shorelines, we use high-resolution (HR) Airbus SPOT imagery (1.5-2.5m
resolution), this enables us to focus on the visible key indicators like the white foam created by waves
hitting the shore and wet dark sand suggesting the maximum runup of the waves. For our dataset,
we create a separate water-runup class, in addition to the usual sea and land classes. We convert the
problem of shoreline detection to Ô¨Åne-grained segmentation along the coast. We employ state-of-art
deep learning algorithms to model this problem. Training and validation is conducted on individual
images and further tested on few hotspot shoreline regions to showcase the observed change in a
time-wise fashion. By doing so, we present a case for automated systems using HRsatellite imagery
to monitor shoreline trends for high impact regions of the world.
2 Dataset
The dataset is created using high-resolution ( HR) satellite imagery sourced from Airbus SPOT 5,
6 and 7 satellite constellation capturing the globe since 2003 with the panchromatic resolution
of 1.5m and 2.5m. As already mentioned in section 1, sandy beaches are of high importance
because of high population density, and loose soil texture resulting into heavy erosion and accretion
phenomena. Another criteria taken into consideration for selection of regions is to diversify in order
to accommodate variations incorporated by change in geographies. The current picked area list
includes Chennai (India), Nubel Island (Denmark), Coolangatta Bay (Australia), Freeport Texas
(USA) and Byron Bay (Australia), with more areas being explored.
All the previous approaches using semantic segmentation formulation have made it a two-class
segmentation problem i.eland v/s sea segmentation, this has aligned with the resolution of imagery
used previously (10m to 30m) because the points at shoreline where the waves are hitting the beach
are inconspicuous. Since in our work we are using HRimagery, we can delineate various indicators
with much more clarity like the water line [3, 15], where the body of water hits the slope of beach
creating white foam, and the wet sand line [16, 6] which is the upper wetting limit of the foreshore
visible as dark sand in the image. Hence, we create mask segments with 3 classes: Land, Sea and
2Water-runup. The beach area between the water line (foam) and the wet sand line is marked as
water-runup, the central region shown in Figure 1. The length of shoreline covered in the dataset
we‚Äôve currently procured and processed is around 60 kilometers and more being added. We are
ensuring high quality annotations via strict quality check. For few of the hotspot regions, multiple
images will be used across a longer time-frame to automatically track the shoreline change trend as a
demonstration. Note that in the Ô¨Ånal version of the dataset, more areas will be added to make the
dataset exhaustive. As of the date of writing, this is the Ô¨Årst comprehensive dataset for estimating
shorelines using HRsatellite imagery with special focus given to shorelines by introducing a speciÔ¨Åc
class.
3 Method
We are posing this problem as a three-class semantic segmentation task and posit to use state-of-art
deep learning (DL) algorithms for modeling purposes. To the best of our knowledge, only Yang et al.
[23] have employed DLalgorithms for binary sea-land segmentation using 30m resolution Landsat
imagery for restricted regions in China. Our goal is to create a general model which can be robustly
applied to any sandy shoreline across the globe achieving high accuracy. We propose to:
1.Split the dataset into two sets of geographies. In the Ô¨Årst set, we‚Äôll split the data for training
and validation purposes and the second set will be used purely for testing purposes. The
second set of geographies will be tested on multiple images from a larger time-span to
demonstrate the efÔ¨Åcacy of developed models for shoreline monitoring.
2.We will explore and compare the performance of different semantic segmentation architec-
tures varying from UNet [17], DeeplabV3 [2], HR-Net [21] etc.
3.To push the optimization towards a better minima, we will try out loss functions like cross-
entropy, dice loss [19], focal loss [13] etc; also thorough hyper-parameter search for learning
rate, loss multipliers, class balancing and batch size will be done.
We will be publicly releasing the codebase, weights for the baseline models as well as the curated
dataset to further research development in this direction.
4 Discussion
With increasing amount of emissions leading to changing climate, in terms of rising temperature and
melting glaciers, has led to a continuous rise in the sea-level. This is directly resulting into changing
shorelines, and coastal zones being heavily populated makes it crucial to continuously monitor the
changes. The recent upheaval of remote sensing technologies along-with the advent deep learning
provide a great set of tools to establish automatic trigger systems and further enabling prevention and
mitigation strategies in a timely manner. In the Ô¨Ånal version of this work, we will be releasing the
curated HRsatellite imagery dataset as well as the code. We will also demonstrate the applicability of
developed models on new hotspot regions across a larger time-frame of imagery while delineating the
observed shift in shorelines. Finally, we hope that this work helps in the advancement of shoreline
monitoring algorithms and system developments to create positive climate impact for the overall
good of our planet.
