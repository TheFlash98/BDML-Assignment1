Abstract
The cement manufacturing industry is an essential
component of the global economy and infrastruc-
ture. However, cement plants inevitably produce
hazardous air pollutants, including greenhouse
gases, and heavy metal emissions as byproducts
of the process. Byproducts from cement manu-
facturing alone accounts for approximately 5%
of global carbon dioxide ( CO 2) emissions1. We
have developed ”Autopilot” - a machine learn-
ing based Software as a Service (SaaS) to learn
manufacturing process dynamics and optimize the
operation of cement plants - in order to reduce the
overall fuel consumption and emissions of cement
production.
Autopilot is able to increase the ratio of alternative
fuels (including biowaste and tires) to Petroleum
coke, while optimizing operation of pyro, the core
process of cement production that includes the
preheater, kiln and cooler. Emissions of gases
such as NO xandSOx, and heavy metals such
as mercury and lead which are generated through
burning petroleum coke can be reduced through
the use of Autopilot. Our system has been proven
to work in real world deployments and an analy-
sis of cement plant performance with Autopilot
enabled shows energy consumption savings and
a decrease of up to 28,000 metric tons of CO 2
produced per year.
1. Introduction
Clinker is the main ingredient in cement, manufactured
through a pyro process. In the pyro process, raw material
including limestone is fed into a preheater equipped with a
pre-calciner which directly discharges into a rotary kiln (See

around 1450 °C. In order to achieve such temperatures, the
ﬂame must be about 2000 °C.
There are two signiﬁcant sources of CO 2generated by the
manufacturing of clinker. The ﬁrst source is limestone
(CaCO 3) that is chemically broken down to CaO andCO 2
at high temperatures. This chemical process alone accounts
for 5% of all man-made CO 2produced (Andrew, 2018).
The other source of CO 2from the pyro process is the burn-
ing of fuels in the preheater tower, pre-calciner and kiln,
which primarily use Petroleum coke (pet coke) as the source
of fuel. For every pound of pet coke burnt as fuel, 3.1
pounds of CO 2are produced.
Figure 1. The pyro process that produces clinker
The raw material ﬂows from the preheater to the kiln, and
from the kiln to the clinker cooler, where clinker is cooled
down and thermal energy is recovered by heating combus-
tion air to be used in the kiln and pre-calciner. The ﬂow of
air moves in the opposite direction. Fans force atmospheric
air into the cooler, which is then brought into the kiln and
preheater by induced draft fans at the start of the preheater.
Air that ﬂows from the cooler into the rotary kiln is called
Secondary Air, while one that ﬂows to the pre-calciner is
called Tertiary Air. Our Autopilot system is able to adjust
control parameters of the cooler in order to maximize the
Secondary Air Temperature. This helps reduce the amount
of fuel required to heat the air and material to their required
temperatures.Autopilot of Cement Plants for Reduction of Fuel Consumption and Emissions

2. Autopilot
We have been working closely with several of the largest
cement companies in the world to understand cement pro-
cesses. We worked with plant operators and subject matter
experts from these companies to understand their objectives
for improving efﬁciency of operation while reducing fuel
consumption and emissions.
The majority of industrial companies aggregate their real-
time sensor and control system data into data historians
in order to perform archiving and retrospective analysis
of asset and operational data. The Autopilot solution is
designed to connect to these plant data servers to efﬁciently
and securely stream the sensor data to a cloud-based service
(See ﬁgure 2). The system is capable of aggregating this data
across many sites, processes and assets in real-time. The
data is distributed to the AI and ML models developed to
provide predictions and prescriptions for operating various
assets to optimize operational objectives while maintaining
safe operating conditions. The safety bounds and criteria by
which an asset should be operated by are provided by the
plant operators and used as additional input to the system.
The input data and the suggested prescribed optimizations
are also visualized to allow for monitoring and evaluation
of the plant operations and Autopilot results.
The Autopilot system also provides an Auto-steer mode,
which allows the optimized control prescriptions which
have been suggested, to be written to the control system
set points and directly operate the asset or process. The
system is continuously monitoring and analyzing the input
sensor data and control prescriptions for all conﬁgured pro-
cesses. This allows for detection of changes to the data or
outlier conditions, as well as cases where a sensor or asset
is damaged or malfunctioning.
The Autopilot system has already been operationalized at
several cement manufacturing plants and auto-steer has suc-
cessfully been enabled and resulted in increased efﬁciency
and decrease in fuel consumption in comparison to when
the same process is controlled solely by a human operator.
Through the use of containerization and cloud technologies,Autopilot is able to efﬁciently scale and deploy many use
cases simultaneously and provide remote auto-steer to opti-
mize the cement manufacturing process at a global scale.
3. Algorithm
3.1. Problem Deﬁnition
Given an asset in a cement product line, provide real-time
control prescriptions that optimize certain target goals, while
at the same time keeping the system in safe operating zone.
As time passes, the sensor status may change and thus cause
the sensor measurement distribution to change due to the
underlying process or sensor malfunction. The system also
exhibits a narrow control space and constraint range, making
it harder to satisfy constraints if the system is not consistent
and accurate. Any noise in the learned dynamics may lead
to more violation in control prescriptions although those
controls may be feasible.
Suppose at current time step, we want to ﬁnd optimal control
several steps ahead. Let Xbe the set of system sensors, Oas
the objective set, Cas the constraint set with Cbthe bounds,
Pas the control or prescription set with Pbthe bounds, we
want to adjust Pto satisfy O, while at the same time satisfy
CbandPb.
Unlike in common experimental setting where the model
assumes presence of every input and output, we allow any
sensor in X,Oas well as Cto be absent due to various
reasons such as high environment temperature. Important
sensors that act as controls or constraints cannot be averted.
3.2. Method
We have developed a real-time optimal control system with
fault tolerance, which is a full dynamic system that accepts
change of Cb,Pb,X,Cand even O. We model the dy-
namics of a cement plant using deep learning techniques,
and optimize based on the learned dynamics. The control
space is multi-dimensional and non-smooth. We developed
advanced searching algorithms to search optimal solutions.
The algorithms incorporate the feature importance during
search process and thus produce the best possible solution
by considering the weights among features.
We designed the system so that it can adapt to such dynamic
changes in real-time operation. Even when sensors are
faulty or not available, our system is still able to make
optimal operation suggestions while simultaneously keeping
operation in safe zone by leveraging the learned knowledge
of the relationships among faulty and healthy sensors.
Through the serving phase when the Autopilot is deployed,
the model will receive signal from the Data Historian when-
ever some sensors fail and react accordingly. We adoptAutopilot of Cement Plants for Reduction of Fuel Consumption and Emissions

concept drift and stabilize the automatic operation.
3.3. Successful Use Case
The cooler is an integral part of a rotary kiln and is respon-
sible for a critical part of the cement manufacturing process,
by lowering the temperature of the clinker output material
by recycling heat back into the kiln. Our model must comply
with several requirements of the operation of this equipment
and must meet a group of objectives related to energy ef-
ﬁciency, product quality, and safety. The main objectives
are described as follows: 1. Secondary Air Temperature
(SAT) should be as high as possible in order to have high
heat recovery and good conbustion efﬁciency in the kiln. 2.
Tertiary Air Temperature (TAT) should be as high as possi-
ble in order to have high heat recovery and good combustion
efﬁciency in the pre-calciner. 3. Clinker temperature should
be reduced to a minimum value. 4. Kiln pressure must be
kept negative. 5. Under-grate pressure should be maintained
within a stable range.
We ran a set of statistical tests that show our model has a
signiﬁcant impact on the increase of SAT and TAT, while
simultaneously achieving all of the objectives mentioned
above. To analyze the model performance, a continuous
26 days of data were collected where Autopilot was turned
on and off at random intervals during business hours. Data
was split into two groups, ON and OFF, based on whether
Autopilot was enabled. Group ON had 243 hours of data
while group OFF had 377 hours of data. We then measured
ONSAT, ON TAT, OFF SAT and OFF TAT, based on those
groups. To equalize the sample sizes between ON and
OFF groups, we further pruned the OFF SAT and OFF TAT
datasets by removing the data points with the lowest values,
to reduce the bias on lower OFF values. As shown in table
1, hypothesis tests were applied to the two pairs of samples
(ON SAT vs OFF SAT and ON TAT vs ON SAT) and the
lowp-values show that our model had a signiﬁcant impact
on increasing the expected values of SAT and TAT when
Autopilot was enabled. Figure 3 visually conﬁrms a higher
temperature with Autopilot ON.
The median fuel saved in the pre-calciner burner and main
burner is 17.42 mmBTU and 14.09 mmBTU respectively.
Given that every 102.41 kg of CO 2is produced per mmBtu

of pet coke2, running Autopilot has resulted in a relative
decrease in CO 2production by 3,226.9 kgs of CO 2every
hour. Over a year, this theoretically could result in saving
up to 28,000 metric tons of CO 2on a single cooler alone.
4. Conclusion
We created a fully dynamic Autopilot system, leveraging
deep learning to provide real-time optimal operation during
cement production that can help reduce fuel consumption
and emissions. The system is robust to concept drift and
fault-tolerant to unexpected sensor malfunctions encoun-
tered during real operations, and was tested and veriﬁed in
real-world cement plants. Our system is generalized enough
to be quickly adapted to other use cases within the cement
manufacturing process and deployed to additional cement
plants with similar use cases. Running Autopilot has proven
to efﬁciently recuperate temperature from the cooler to the
kiln and pre-calciner, thus reducing the need to burn addi-
tional fuels. We reached a reduction of CO 2emissions by
over 3000 kgs per hour, or up to 28,000 metric tons saved
per year, for each cooler running Autopilot.
